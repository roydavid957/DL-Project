Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?	She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.	Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.	But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?	Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.	That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.	I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.	You can stop it right now.	"When he was baby we called him ""Wa Wa,"" a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful."	Oh, Mother, cut it out.	There are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty and that's all there is to it. Beauty is there and we have to recognize it. Now Rose, the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She looks like an angel and she is an angel, but she can be a naughty angel sometimes, although her father won't believe it. Her real name is Frances, but we call her Dolly or Doll.
Mother... is Rose going to die?	No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
Oh, no, ma'am.	Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?	More history, Rose.	Are you going to get your degree soon?	Well, I am working on my thesis.	It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.	Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?	You're so sweet.
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?	I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.	Well, you run on now.	Yes, Ma'am.
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?	No, ma'am, I'm just fine.	You look sick if you ask me. I hate to leave you with the dishes and all, but I'm supposed to go to a meeting of the Garden Club this evening.  I'll need the car keys.
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?	Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
Yes, Ma'am.	Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.	Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.	I had better call Daddy.
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.	Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
I don't want to go to the dentist.	Be quiet, Rose.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?	Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.	No, Rose, he'll help you.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!	Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!	Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna kill me.
Never again, never again...	I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...	No more dentists, no more dentists...	It'll get better now.
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?	Yes, ma'am.
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?	What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.	Yeah, it's kinda nice.	You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.	Well, you're real sweet to make it for me.  There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.	Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.	I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.	I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.	I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.	Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.	Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address.
Rose, you don't have to.	I don't mind.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.	I was offered that job as a waitress.	Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!	Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.	And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right!
I... I can explain...	I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.	I was going to tell him.	What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?	But... I love him.  I do...
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.	You're not gonna see him again.	What... what makes you think you can order me around?!	Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?	... okay... you made your point.
Indivisible and inseparable.	Incestuous.	Every person's got their own kinks, beef-cake.  What's wrong, Kittle?  You don't swing?
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.	Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.	A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  It's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
How much?	I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.	You think it's that good?	I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.	Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
You get nothing and like it.  And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.	Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I... I heard how the shit's arriving...  It's coming in a Lincoln.
And... ?	What and?  That's what I got.	A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?	Now you know what to watch for...	Am I supposed to take this information and sit up in the hills with a frickin' telescope?
Have I ever steered you wrong?	Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?	Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...	Who cares?	Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...	Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...	Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.	Fair enough.
This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!	Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...	I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.	Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!	I don't know.  Fuck off!
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.	If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?	You don't.  It's a gamble.  But, not even in Vegas are you gonna get close to this kind of cash.  This is <U>two million</U>, Archie.  It's not three houses, it's twelve.  It's dreams come true.
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float.	What... ?	Abe Lincoln...
Kittle...	Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.	Really?  Is that a fact... ?
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?	Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
Hey now... what the fuck... ?	Again.
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.	I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.	This scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the Mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.  You think we're gonna let Zimmermann haul it onto <U>our</U> streets on the Fourth-of-fucking-July!?
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?	Alright!  Alright... put me down...
It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's hurting.  The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.	"I need the ""when"" and the ""where."""	I don't know, okay?  All I know is Butch Cassidy's back in town.
How's your precious little school-marm today?	She's fine, as if you cared.	Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.	Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?	Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.	Lay off once, would you?	What'd I say?	It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
"She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you ""daddy."""	Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.	What, am I supposed to read it while I drive?  Keep a grip on it, alright?
You shouldn't litter.	Thank you, concerned citizen.	Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.	I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.	Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.	That wasn't my fault.	Save it.  Just go.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.	What do you want me to do about it?
Sons of bitches!	We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.	We'll share.
I can work this.	No you can't.	Get ready.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.	I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.	Move it!
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!	Relax.	We should slow down.	Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
Jiminy Christmas.	I can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt.
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.	Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.	What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?	I'm just saying...	You're just saying nothing!  Tonight is the night.	Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.	What of it?  Haven't we waited forever... ?  Haven't we, honey?  Haven't we waited long enough to get this scumbag?
All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?	You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...
We shoulda been there to back you up. We shoulda!	Stop blaming yourself.
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!	I got him.
"""A.D."""	Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
Where you gonna be?	It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
No offices are gonna be open today.	Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
Okay, we got... one, two... three...  Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.	Could be worse.  I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?	Yeah.	The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?	Yeah.	That's them trying to kill us.	Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!	Clench your teeth.	Wh... what... ?!	Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
That's sick.	Welcome to Beverly Hills. Wife-swapping Capital of the World.
What's the plan?	Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
When you planning to cut back on that?	What?	The booze.	I don't know.  I could quit now if I wanted, I just don't want to.
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle	Name one.	Dean Martin.	Entertainers don't count.
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?	Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?	What about him?	You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
They... they shot me.	They shot us all, kid.	What day is it?	Same day as before.  I think.
Where we going?	We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
How you doing back there?	Feeling great.
Gimmie a butt.	You don't smoke.	I'm not taking a cigarette break, jackass, just give me one!
Happy Independence Day.	Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
Why do I always have to sit in back?	It's just the way things are, kiddo.	Well, I would like to sit in front today.	It's not gonna happen.
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?	Wha... ?	Birth control's important.	What... what kinda thing is that to say?
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.	Bullshit.	You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...	I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.	Oh... okay.
What's mine say?	"""Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."""	It doesn't say that.	No, but it should.
Hey...	Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
That's him alright.	It's go time, Billy-B.
Smooth move, hot-shot.	What was I supposed to do?
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.	You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
What the... ?!  What was that for?	Follow me.	How come everyone thinks hitting me's the best way to get my attention?
Where we going?	We have to find Kittle.
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?	Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !	Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
I can't believe we're stealing.	We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.	No, we're stealing.	This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?	Then, why'd we tie him up?
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.	Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
You live like a pig.	Can't you say something nice once?	Okay.  It doesn't smell as bad in here as I remember it smelling.
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.	If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.	Speak for yourself.
Whoa, whoa... it's gonna be alright.	... where... where's a jerk like me ever gonna find another girl to love him... huh?...
Don't talk like that.  There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.	You're lying...
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?	I'm waiting till the time's right.
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?	No.	General Jim Beam, then.	Nope.	Oh.  Well.   I think it's pretty common knowledge that in the Battle of Little Big Horn, Custer was drunk off his ass.
"Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word ""stupidity."""	What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
You could start over again with cash like that.	Go wherever you want.  Live how you want.
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.	There probably is.	Bummer.
He tried to kill us.	We've got the tape to prove it.
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.	There'll be other chances.	Not like this.  Are you even listening?
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?	Where have you been?	I'm here.  That's all that counts. Watch... you'll enjoy this... it's like magic...
Our resignations.	You going rogue on me?	Maybe.	What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.	You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?	There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.	You can't be serious.	Can't I?	We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?
He went to pick up lunch.	Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.	Yes, sir.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!	Well, sir...	No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?	I... I think I can... clarify...	Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.	What?
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!	You're about an inch away from insubordination!	Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?	Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?	Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.	Thank you for sharing that charming image.
Couldn't have said it better myself.	You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?	Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.	Murderer?  Really?
"Thanks, but we don't recognize ""brunch"" as an actual meal."	I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.	Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?	It's our job.	You think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? Fuck you!   This is meaningless! You'll never win!  You know, as soon as I'm gone... someone's going to take my place.
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?	Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
Pure horse.	You are such a disappointment, Benny.
Arriving tonight	Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.	"Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  ""Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."""	Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.	"""Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."""	Let me see that...  Not bad.
Yeah... great.	You know... you could say thank you.	You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.	What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...	First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...	You know what I mean.	Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?	Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.	All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
Alright?	Absolutely.
We got him.	Slow down.	"""Go, go, go!""  ""Slow down.""  Make up your mind."	Don't crowd him.
Hold your horses, sweetpea.  We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?	Shit.  You're right.
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.	Let's hope.
I'm gonna get beside him.	No you're not.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.	No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!	You think this is so easy?	Can't be worse than you.	Oh yeah?	That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.	Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
Get closer!  Don't lose him!	I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...	Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
What... ?  Not you too?	He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.	I can't believe I'm hearing this,	I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.	That's not true.	I know it is, even if you don't.
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.	Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
You need a doctor.	Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
Any preferences?	Whatever goes bang.
Let's get this thing done.	All for one...
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!	Out here.  On your knees.
You get him?	Dead.	Chalk up another victory for Billy-Boy's one man war on crime.
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?	Gimmie a minute.
"Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who ""A.D."" is.  I got a quick errand to run."	Sounds good.
Been waiting long?	Just got here.	How'd we do?	A.D. is a C.P.A.	Come again... ?	Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.	Maybe it's enough.
Get his attention.	Your wish is my command.
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.	Who is that... ?
What the hell's his problem?	You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?	Seatbelts fastened, please.
You suck at lying, Archie.	See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.	It's just a question of how long do we have to slap you silly till you spill the beans.
We're screwed.	I'm well aware of that.
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.	There's not even enough places to stash it in a car.
No more counting the big money for someone else.	Beholden to none.
Think Zimmermann's watching?	Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
You John-Wilkes-Booth-ed him.	Billy!  Billy!
Why the beach?	So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
Oh, yeah... the explosion.	Know what I love about dynamite?	Do tell.	When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.	I don't think so.	Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
The gang's all here!	Keep 'em busy.
You see that?	Yeah.	Good.  Thought I was imagining them.
You always did have style.	It's one of a kind.	So are you, Pop-Sweet.  That's why...
This shit was Ming.	That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?	They're... around.	Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.	"The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling ""escort service"" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight."	Well, let me tell you how it is...
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.	Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.	All right. Stand by.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.	You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.	We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.	Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.	We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.	We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.	Yoda will always be with you.
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.	You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
There's still good in him.	I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.	I can't do it, Ben.	You cannot escape your destiny.	I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.	Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.	But I had to help my friends.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!	I can't kill my own father.	Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.	Yoda spoke of another.	The other he spoke of is your twin sister.	But I have no sister.	Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.	Leia! Leia's my sister.	Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.	She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.	I can't see.	Your eyesight will return in time.	Where am I?	Jabba's palace.	Who are you?
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.	You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.	Yes, my Master.	Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.	As you wish.	Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
What is thy bidding, my Master?	Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.	What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?	It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.	Yes, my Master.
I told you to remain on the command ship.	A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
I have felt him, my Master.	Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
They are clear, my Master.	Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.	His lightsaber.
Han!	Luke!	Are you all right?	Fine. Together again, huh?	Wouldn't miss it.	How are we doing?	The same as always.	That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.	There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.	You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.	Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.	Oh... great!
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?	I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Luke.	Hi, Han... Chewie.
You got her warmed?	Yeah, she's comin' up.
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?	All set.
Vader's on that ship.	Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
I don't know.  Fly casual.	I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.	It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.	Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
I thought she was with you.	We got separated.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.	Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.	Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?	Yeah, sure.
Hey!	Han, don't. It'll be all right.
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.	Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
Someone who loves you.	Leia!	I gotta get you out of here.
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!	That's all any of us can see.
Hey, are you awake?	Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.	It'll work. It'll work.
Shall we try and go around?	It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
What's going on?	I don't know.
I...	Ahhh...
I'm sorry.	Hold me.
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.	Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.	Charges!  Come on, come on!
The code's changed. We need Artoo!	Here's the terminal.
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.	He wasn't. I can feel it.	You love him, don't you?
Yes.	All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
Han! Chewie?	Lando!
Lando, grab it!	Lower it!	I'm trying!
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.	No, wait! I thought you were blind!	It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.	All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.	Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
Well, look at you, a general, huh?	Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.	All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
Good luck.	You, too.
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.	Good, I hate long waits.	You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.	On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
Here we go again.	All right, hang on.
What are you telling them?	Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?	I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.	Proper?!	It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
What did he say?	I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
We're coming!	Come on! Come on!	Oh, Artoo, hurry!
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?	Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?	Let's see.
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.	You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.	Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.	I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.	The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.	But he asks the impossible. I need more men.	Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.	We shall double our efforts.	I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
All wings report in.	Red Leader standing by.
Good shot, Red Two.	Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
I'm going in.	Here goes nothing.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.	Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
There it is!	All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.	Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
Ugh!	Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
Oh!	Your Royal Highness.
What's he saying?	He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!	Quiet.	I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.	Oh, no.
Over there! Two more of them!	I see them. Wait, Leia!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?	Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.	What do you remember?	Just...images, really. Feelings.	Tell me.	She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.	Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?	Vader is here...now, on this moon.
He's my father.	Your father?	There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.	You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
Yes. It's you Leia.	I know. Somehow...I've always known.	Then you know why I have to face him.	No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.	No, you don't. You've always been strong.	But, why must you confront him?	Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
The Emperor has been expecting you.	I know, father.	So, you have accepted the truth.
Come with me.	Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.	I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.	If that is your destiny.	Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.	It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.	I will not fight you, father.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.	There is no conflict.	You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.	You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.	I will not fight you.	Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.	Never-r-r!
Master Yoda, you can't die.	Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.	But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.	No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Yoda, I must know.	Your father he is.
Told you, did he?	Yes.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...	Unfortunate that I know the truth?
Well, I'm sorry.	Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?	I am See-Threepio, human-cy...	Yes or no will do.	Oh. Well, yes.	How many languages do you speak?	I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...	Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.	Disintegrated?
Do you have any tattoos Brad.	Certainly not!	Oh well.  How about you.
You!	I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
Why you - what have you done with Janet?	Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.	I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.	Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.	Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?	Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.	Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
You promise you won't tell?	On my mother's grave.
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.	I told you, my car broke down.
I was telling the truth.	I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.	He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.	And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?	He might be.  I don't know.	Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Janet!	Rocky!
It's as if we were glued to the spot.	You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
The future is ours so let's plan it.	Janet.	So please don't tell me to can it.	Janet.	I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. I love you.
Janet.	Made me give you the eye And then panic,	Janet
Yes.	Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.	Yes.	And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.	Yes.
Yes Brad.	I've got something to say.	Uh huh.	I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.	Oh Brad.
Oh Janet	For you.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.	Dammit, Janet.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.	Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.	Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?	Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
What was that bang?	We must have a blow-out.	Oh...
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.	But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.	Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
I'm coming with you.	There's no point both of us getting wet.	I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.	Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.	Yes.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?	Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
Oh....Say something.	Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
Brad, please lets get out of here.	For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.	But it seems so unhealthy here.	It's just a..a party Janet.	Well I want to leave.	We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.	Then ask the butler - or someone.	Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.	This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.	They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.	Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.	I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
Right!	We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
Oh Brad.	It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.	Weiss.	Weiss.
Brad...	It's alright Janet.
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...	It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.	Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.	No, don't do that.	Oh don't be so shy.
Maybe we could try it this way.	Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.	I hope so my darling.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.	And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.	So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.	I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?	And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.	If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
Hello.	Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?	You're wet.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.	You know this earth - this person.	I most certainly do.  He happens to be an old friend of mine.
Good God.	Yes.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.	Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
You did right.	A decision had to be made.	You're OK by me.	Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.	Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.	You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.	I didn't make him for you
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?	Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?	You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never	I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?	Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.	Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
Promise you won't tell Brad.	Cross my heart and hope to die.
What a guy	Makes you cry

On the day I went away.	Goodbye	Was all I had to say	Now I	Want to come again and stay	Oh my, my,	Smile and that will mean I may

Are you - giving a party?	No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.	Oh, lucky him.
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.	Oh.
Who's Eddie?	The delivery boy.

"Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our ""androgenous"" planet."	Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...	But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.	And our World will do the Time Warp again.
...How's the turtle food this week?	...Fine.	Me, I'm kinda aggravated.	...I'm sorry.	Ain't your fault -- Here's the problem.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?	...I don't know.	Shell-shocked!
Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.	...Goodnight, Rocky.
It's Thanksgiving.	To you, to me it's Thursday.
Looks quiet, y'know.	I think it's closed.	I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --
...Aren't you skating?	Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.	And you never got the chance?
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.	Absolutely.
I just dislocated my finger.	Ohh!
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?	By accident?
What's funny?	My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
Some people are very shy by nature.	...I suppose.	I would say you're very shy by nature.	...I suppose.	Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.	It doesn't bother me either.	Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.	...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.	Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.	I don't think you're a bum.	...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.	Morning after?	After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.	Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?	...Guess.	'Cause you can't sing or dance?
Would ya like a glass of water?	...No thanks.
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.	I sold them to you.	...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.	Do you have a phone?	I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?	I wanna let my brother know where I am.	D'you really wanna call?	Yes, I do.	You sure?	Yes.	Why?	I think he might be worried.	I'll call your brother.
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?	It's fine.	It's only temporary.	It's not that --	What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?	I don't think I belong here.	It's okay.	No, I don't belong here.	It's all right -- You're my guest.	...I've never been in a man's apartment before.	They're all the same.	I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.	Yo, I'm not comfortable either.	I should leave.	But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
Would ya take off your glasses?	What?	The glasses... Please.
...T-thank you.	Do me another favor?	...What?	Could ya take off that hat.
I always knew you was pretty.	Don't tease me.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?	I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?	Ya puttin' me on, right?	Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?	'Bout seven.	I'll be waiting.
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?	Yes.	It did.
Don't you open them anymore?	They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
Like?	Sharp -- Real nice.	Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?	No... Sharp -- You look great.
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.	Don't want weak legs.	Can't fool around -- You look very great.	-- The legs.	Yeah... But I think weak legs ain't bad sometimes, y'know.
I thought it might be cute.	Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
...And he called the reporters --	Yeah... Threw my whole day off.	Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.	Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.	...Are you going to say anything to him?	...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me --
Wanna hear a dirty joke?	...Yes --
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.	Yeah...
What was that you said about a pet shop?	...What?	What did you say about a pet shop?	I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.	Is everything all right?	I gotta go out for a while.
...Can't do it.	...What?	...I can't beat him.	Apollo?	Yeah, I can't beat him.
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.	What're we going to do?	...I dunno.	Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.	It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --	Don't say that.	C'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed. If I go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood...
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.	Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.	No... I can't!	Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.	Paulie, please --	Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.	...Like you?	Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.	I can't go out.	Why?	Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.	Paul.
Oh, Rocky!	Christ.	You didn't!
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.	That so.	Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance.
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!	Paulie!	Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!	It's not your house --	You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!	Don't talk like that to him!	Get outta my life both of ya's.
...Paulie. Stop now!	I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!	Only a pig would say that!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.	You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!	I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
Don't do that again!	Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!	Owe you what?	You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!	Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me.
You busted?!	What?!	You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.	You's the novelty, Champ!	Give my main man a raise!!
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.	...I don't feel heat from the name.
He won't last one round.	Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.	I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.	Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
...That boy damn near broke my arm.	Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?	I'll carry him 'till the third.	Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.	People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.	He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.	He got lucky.	Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!
My side.	Get that doctor.	No doctor!	You're hurtin', man!	No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.	One more round.	Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.	...Stop jivin'!	Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!	...Thanks.
Damn.	I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!	I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.	Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.	Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!	Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!	...It's very American.	No, man, it's very smart.
How 'bout this Billy Snow?	Fouls.	How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.	...Still don't feel no heat.	Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?	...This man.
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.	Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --	Don't matter -- That name. 'The Italian Stallion,' it's right on.  Who discovered America? An Italian, right? So, man, what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors --
How was the flight, Champ?	Very high an' very fast.
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?	He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.	You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?	That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!	Still to be held in Philadelphia?	The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.	Where're you off to now?
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.	Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?	...Stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- Be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!! Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- Be a thinker not a stinker!!
Did ya get the license number?	Of wa?	...Of the truck that run over your face.
Hear she's retarded.	She ain't retarded, she's shy.	Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.	Does that bum have to say that?
I don't like ya face.	Don't like yours neither.	Kiss my ass.	Move your shoulders down.
Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.	...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.	C'mon, man, it's cold, man.	No wine.	Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.	Why?	'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.	No dollar.	Hey, give Rocky a dime.
...That's an old one.	Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.	Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!	Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.	Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.	Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.	Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --	This a con?	Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --	Few minutes?	...Ten minutes.	Ten minutes for ten dollars.	...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
Nine minutes!	Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
Seven minutes!	It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?	Six!	How 'bout some Cokes?	Cost ya a buck.	This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
Here -- Three minutes.	Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
That's ten bucks.	I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
...How 'bout for the Cokes?	Charge it.
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.	Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.	I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --	Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.	It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.	I agree.
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.	The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --	Creed is down!!!
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.	Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.	There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.	No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --	Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
I say ya nothin'!	What's happenin' here?	I'm happenin'! This pig is takin' my shot -- I iz a contender. He's nothin'.
You can forget about sparring, kid.	Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!	Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.	Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
Yo' yellow, old man.	Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!	Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!	Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.	Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.	Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs.
What's ya name again?	Bob.	Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band -- If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... Me, I ain't emotionally involved.
A hundred an' thirty.	That's it, I'm broke.	That's it? -- Completely?	That's it.	What about for food an' stuff?	You have my food in ya hand.
...The juice is climbin' every week.	I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.	Ya still light seventy.	Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.	Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?	...Fine.
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.	I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.	It don't matter. It's my reputation. These guys think they can get off light. It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business. See ya killer.
Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?	No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.	Ya sure?	Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?	How'd you know?	You think I don't hear things?	Paulie's sister.
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.	He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.	Yeah.	Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.	Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.	Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.	I feel bad about walkin'.	Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?	A few bucks.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.	Do I have to pay juice?
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?	Gonna try.	Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.	No action.	Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?	I'm gonna do somethin with it.	Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.	Black market?	Same thing. Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together. An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name? -- Gallager -- I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves. An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains --I'd like to lay hands on that bastard. You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid. Whatta you think?
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?	Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.	...Thanks.	Mr. Balboa --	Rocky.	Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?	No -- Just me.	Rocky, would you be interested in --	Sparrin'?	Excuse me.	I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.	I'm sure you are.	Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?	What?	I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?	...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.	Did you hear what I said?	Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.	Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship.
...Screw you.	What'd you say?	...Screw you, yoyo.
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?	Hey --	What?	Stuff it, man!	Don't you never say that --  -- You guys talk like that in front of a little girl -- You guys are scum.
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.	I like 'em. If you don't you can f --	Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.	...Yeah.
Make your teeth yella --	I like yella teeth.	Makes your breath like garbage.	Maybe I like garbage.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.	Why?	'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.	C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.	That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.	What?	Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.
Listen, I hope ya don't --	I won't.	What was I gonna say?	Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?	Ya, somethin' like that.
Goodnight, Rocky.	'Night, Marie.
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --	Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?	...What?	I said, how ya feelin'?	Do you see me talkin'? Huh?	Yeah.	Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?	I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?	Dipper needed it.
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.	...Tomato?	Facts is facts. I run a business here -- I'm cleanin' house --
How old are ya?	...What?	How old?	Come July, twenty-five.	More like thirty.	Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.	The legs must be goin'.	Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.	...Did ya fight last night?	Yeah --	Did ya win?	Yeah, Kayo.	...Who'd ya fight?	Spider Rice.	Rice is a bum.	You think everybody I fight is a bum.	Ain't they?
Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.	Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.	Hey, ever think about retirin'?	...No.	Think about it.	Yeah, sure.
Did ya get the message, kid?	Message -- What message?
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.	Ya puttin' me on?	Here's the card?	When was they here?	'Bout an hour ago.	Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.	...I said that before.
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.	Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.	How do you mean?	I'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.	Yeah.	What's happened is freak luck.	Freak luck for sure.	Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...	Freak luck is a strange thing.
Whatta' those?	Turtles -- domestic turtles.	I'm here tellin' ya to be very smart with this shot. Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Fifty years, huh.	Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.	How 'bout a glass of water?	Rocky, d'ya know what I done?	...What?	I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.	Ya got a good mind for dates.
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.	Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
Really think so?	Ya got heart.	Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker.
Respect, I always dished ya respect.	...Ya gave Dipper my locker.	I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.	The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.	Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.	I got pain an' experience too.	Please, kid.	Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.	I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.	Rocky, I'm seventy-six years old. Maybe you can be the winner I never was -- your shot is my last shot!
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.	I never had good footwork.
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.	Yo, Benny.	Check the eyes, Ben.
Don't you care what the people will say?	...I'm doin' it for a friend.	Whatta you get outta this?	I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.	...Shrewd.
Don't let 'im get you tight.	Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
God bless ya, Rock.	Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
How am I doin'?	Real good.	See how fast he is -- damn!	Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack -- Attack -- Attack!
Ya nose is broke.	Damn! How's it look?	Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.	...The guy's great.	Why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan!
How you holdin' up, kid?	Fine... That guy's great.	Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?	See what?
Wanna keep goin'?	Would you keep goin'?	...Yeah.
How I look out there, Mick?	Great, kid, great.
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.	Yo, can I have my locker back?
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?	It ain't your locker no more.	Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?	Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
You were ready to bite that guy's face.	Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.	Creed's great.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?	'Bout what?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.	He ain't losin' nothin'.
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.	Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.	Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
How's Butkus this mornin'?	Ain't had time to check 'em.
...What kinda dog is this again?	Bullmastiff.	The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.	We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess.
Yo, Paulie.	Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.	Yo, Paulie.	What?	Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.	Forget her. You could do better than my sister.	Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.	Looks, huh?	Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?	My sister's a friggin' loser.	Hey --	Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.	Don't get mental, man.	Ya caught me in a bad mood.	Ya always in a bad mood --	...Adrian ain't sharp.
She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old!  She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.	I'm thirty myself.	An' you're dyin' alone, too.	I don't see no crowd around you, neither.	I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.	Let's get outta this stink.
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.	...Sure.	Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?	Absolutely...
I usta be deadly at half-ball.	I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.	What kinda business?	Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.	Maybe ya should see a doctor.	I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.	Maybe another job is the best thing.	Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.	Gazzo's gotta come to you.	I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.	Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?	Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?	Maybe ya better forget it.	Forget nothin' -- Here, talk to my sister, tell 'er somethin' nice.
...Maybe I better forget it.	Try again, c'mon, try again.
What's ya sister like to do?	Ice skate.	I didn't want no turkey anyway.
Why?	Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.	It don't matter.	He's takin' cheap shots.	It don't bother me none.	Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?	Help what?	Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.	I'll do okay.	Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.	Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.	Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
How ya feelin'?	...Tight.	I got whiskey here.	...No.
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?	Gazzo's a good man.	How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.	Keep this job, ya eat better.
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?	Whatta you think?	Ain't sure, what's the story?	What?	The story -- what's happenin'?
Ya really like her?	Sure I like her.	What's the attraction? I don't see it?	I dunno -- she fills gaps.	What gaps?	She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.	You ballin' her?	Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.	C'mon, ya screwin' her?
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?	Whatta these guys want?	To see ya train.	Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.	I thought I was doin' ya a favor -- C'mon inside -- Y'know, my sister really likes ya.
Outta my house I want ya!!	...It's cold outside, Paulie.
...I can't haul meat no more.	What can I do about it?	Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.	What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?	...People talk to me more.	How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.	Apollo's a great fighter.	Do you feel you have a chance?	Maybe --
I'll tear his head off.	Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?	Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?	Feel? I dunno... Happy.	How will you fight Apollo Creed?	Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?	Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.	And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?	Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
We don't serve formula. Snookums.	You serve martinis, doncha?	Yeah...
Oh, a ladies man, huh?	My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.	Well, I'll be...	So what's your next move, Valiant?
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.	I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?	Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.	You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.	You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...	C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.	So where is it then?	Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.	Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.	Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?	Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.	Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?	That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.	Shoulda guessed.	He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.	Big on the musical comedy, huh?	Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
What's this, Roger?	A tweeting bird?	That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.	I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.	Don't worry about me.  I can take it.	I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!	Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.	You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.	Is this paper even good?	Check the scrawl.	R.K. Maroon.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.	What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.	No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?	Bastards put him on notice.
Do you think the rabbit did it?	I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.	Thanks for the vote of confidence.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.	Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?	He's a Toon... who cares?
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?	Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
He's a riot.	Oh, yeah?  Well, you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?	It's all yours.
So you decided to help him after all?	I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?	If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
So what's the scam, Eddie?	Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.	Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?	Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
What was <u>that</u>?	<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.	The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?	Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.	I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.	Maroon, right?	Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.	What the hell would they want with a gag factory?	Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
What's that comin' from the bar?	Sounds like singin'.	Oh, no...
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.	I'll bet.	Are you gonna call him, Eddie?	What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?	Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.	That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?	Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.	Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?	Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.	Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?	Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.	So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?	Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?	Ask her...
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.	He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
They must've taken it off me.	They?	The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
Take it easy, Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.	Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.	Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?	Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.	I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.	You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.	Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.	Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.	The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.	I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.	So you're Cloverleaf?	No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.
Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?	It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?	They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.	What the hell's a freeway?	A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.	That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.	Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!	Surprised?	Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
You?	That's right, me.
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.	Earl... it's me, Valiant.	Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?	Toon cops worked me over.	Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.	What am I, Earl?
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.	No...	Does it hurt?	Not much.  It's hard to talk.	Uh, Eddie, do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?	Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.	That's because I don't have a doorbell.
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.	Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?	Toons aren't given imperfections.	No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.	You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.	Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.	No, no, no... I love my husband.	Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.	Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.	Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.	I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.	I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake, remember?
So altruistic.	It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?	Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.	If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
You shot Roger.	That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.	Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?	Why didn't you tell me?	I didn't know who I could trust.	We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.	Where is he?	He's right here in the...
How did you get onto Doom?	Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
So where is it?	When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.	A joker to the end.
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...	Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?	He made me laugh.
Hold on a second.	Eddie, come on.
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.	That's what you woke me up for?
Now what?	Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.	What a gasser.	Wait here...
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?	No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
What's with the dip?	That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
What the hell is that?	Doom.	Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?	He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?	So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?	Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?	One too many safes dropped on his head?	Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
"Here's the problem...  ""Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger"".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up."	So what do you want me to do?	Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.	I don't work in Toontown.	You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.	The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.	A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.	So's the job.
I got him on loan from Disney.	Aren't you the lucky one...
When will I hear from you?	As soon as is humanly possible.
Well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.	Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...	Sure, Valiant, sure...
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?	Valiant?  What're you doin' here?	I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.	I've already seen your photographs.	Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?	Have you got the will?	Maybe.  Why?	Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.	Stop what?
Valiant!  You surprised me.	That was the idea.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?	No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.	Well, everybody needs a hobby.	No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
You got the will in there, don't ya?	No, I don't.	You tricked me, damn you!	Take it easy.	There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
Pattycake!  Pattycake!	Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.	Divorce?  Never!
Aah!	Aah!
What the hell are you doin'?	I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.	So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.	Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.	Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?	Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.	In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.	Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.	If you're so innocent, why'd you run?	Gee, Eddie, I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...	You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?	Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.	Don't ever forget that.
Does this help?	Yeah, that's better.
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?	Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?	My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.	Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.	I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.	Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
The habeus corpus is thickening.	Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.	How do you know that?	Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?	Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
Hey, don't I get an encore?	Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.	But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.	And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!	Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...	An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.	Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.	Just because you got 'em to laugh?	A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.	I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.	I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!	Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?	A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.	I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.	But, Eddie, you know what happens when...	Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...	If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?	My brother.  Get inside.
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?	We can't do anything till it's dark.
Say, who's this guy laughin'?	Me.	Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?	What is this, Twenty Questions?
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!	Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?	You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.	A Toon?  Noooo.	Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.	Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.	Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.	Safe?	Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.
I'll get it.	Get away from there.
Wrong number?	No, it's not.
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.	That's why I'll be there at 8:45.	I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.	Forget it.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.	How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?	Two bits.	I rest my case.
If I don't make it back here by ten...	Yeah?	... I'd head for Cucamonga.
What the hell are you doin' in there?	I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.	Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.	That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.	Yeah...
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?	Yeah?	I think you oughta read it to her.	Good idea.
Keep reading...	Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
No, kid, you're a real hero.	I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.	And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?	Only time will tell.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?	From this box here...
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.	I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?	I do bite my thumb, sir!	Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.	[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
Quarrel sir! no, sir.	If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.	No better?	Uh? Uh?
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.	Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.	Have patience!	Leave Me!	Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.	Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.	Then I'll leave thee.	Tempt not a desperate man!
Romeo! Romeo!	Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?	Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.	Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.	Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.	A challenge, on my life.	Romeo will answer it?	Any man that can write may answer a letter.	Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.	But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?	Why, what is Tybalt?	More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!	The what?
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.	Am I like Such a fellow?	Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.	By my head here come the Capulets.	By my heel, I care not.
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.	Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.	Good-morrow, cousin.	Is the day so young?	But new struck cuz.	Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?	Not having that, which, having, makes them short.	In love?	Out--	Of love?	Out of her favour, where I am in love.	Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!	Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?	No, cuz, I rather weep.	Good heart, at what?	At thy good heart's oppression.	Farewell, my cuz.	Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.	In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.	I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.	A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.	A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.	Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:	Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?	She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.	Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.	Teach me how I should forget to think.	By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?	Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
Every man betake him to his legs.	But 'tis no wit to go.
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.	I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.	Art thou hurt?
What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.	Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?	Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.	Young Romeo is it?	'Tis he.	Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him	I'll not endure him.	He shall be endured	Uncle, 'tis a shame.	Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.	The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.	My poverty, but not my will consents.	I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.	Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.	Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?	My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.	If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!	Hold Daughter!	Be not so long to speak I long to die.	I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.	What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
Good marrow, father!	Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.	The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.	God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?	Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.	That's my good son: but where hast thou been	I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.	Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.	Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.	Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.	Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.	For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.	I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.	O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.	O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.	Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.	Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.	There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.	O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
How well my comfort is revived by this.	Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.	Farewell.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.	And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Juliet!	O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
I come for my lady Juliet.	Welcome.	Where is my Lady's lord?	Romeo, come forth.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.	Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.	She'll not come down tonight.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.	Madam, in happy time what day is that?	Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.	What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!	Here comes your father, tell him so yourself.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.	Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.	O God!--O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? What sayest thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort nurse.
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?	No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.	Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.	Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.	Goodnight.	Romeo, I drink to thee.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!	Madam, I am here. What is your will?
Juliet!	Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.	[Within] Juliet!	I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--	[Within] Juliet!	By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?	I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!	I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.	What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?	How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;	Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,	But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?	Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.	I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?	Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?	Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'	O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.	Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?	Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?	I have.	Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.	Speakest thou from thy heart?	And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.	Amen	What?	Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.	If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.	Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.	Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.	Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.	Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.	Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.	Then have my lips the sin that they have took.	Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.	You kiss by the book.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!	Ay me!	She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!	Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.	[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?	'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.	I take thee at thy word.	Ahhh!	Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?	Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.	How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.	With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.	If they do see thee, they will murder thee.	I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.	Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:	Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--	O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.	Well what shall I swear by?	Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.	If my heart's dear love--	Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.	O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?	What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?	The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.	I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
So thrive my soul--	A thousand times good night! Exit, above	A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.	Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?	By the hour of nine.	I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.	Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.	I must be gone and live, or stay and die.	That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.	Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.	It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.	More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?	I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.	O God, I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. O fortune, fortune. Be fickle, fortune, for then I hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back.
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.	Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.	Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.	By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.	A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.	Verona's summer hath not such a flower.	Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.	This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.	Nay, bigger; women grow by men.	Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!	Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.	Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead	You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.	Under love's heavy burden do I sink.	Too great oppression for a tender thing.	Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.	If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Why, may one ask?	I dream'd a dream to-night.	And so did I.	Well, what was yours?	That dreamers often lie.	In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.	O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!	Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.	True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew- dropping south.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.	Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Ho Ho, Capital Punks!	Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.	Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?	The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?	Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.	That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.	Meaning, to court'sy.	Thou hast most kindly hit it.	A most courteous exposition.	Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.	Pink for flower.	Right.	Why, then is my pump well flowered.	Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.	Here's goodly gear!
I will follow you.	Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.	Courage man, the hurt can not be much.	'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.	I thought all for the best.	A Plague o' both your houses.	NO! Mercutio!
Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?	OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.	You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.	Could you not take some occasion without giving?	Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?	Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?	What wouldst thou have with me?	Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.	I am for you.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.	Is she a Capulet?	His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.	Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
Nurse.	Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.	As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
Do you have it?	Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.	This is important.	Do you really think so?	You know it is.
Why did you do that?	To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
It's under your seat.	What?	As my American friend Larry would say: are you fucking deaf?  It's under your seat.
Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me.  Are we in sync on this, Vincent?	Of course.
We kept it...	Is that right?
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...	Leaving...
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.	Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
Of course.	Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?	I don't know.	When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.	Well I don't!	And I don't believe you...
You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground.	I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth!
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.	So where do you go from here?	I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.	I'm up for that...
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.	Who the fuck are you?	The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.	And who are you?
So what's the deal?	The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.	Which leads us to...
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.	And then...
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.	How do we know that?
I never did trust that blonde fuck...	That's why you were riding with him.
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?	Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.	What is?	Best beer in the world known to man or God.	Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.	Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.	Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?	I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.	Now there's the Deirdre I know.	And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?	It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.	So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?	It's been known to happen.	Not to me, you know that.	I thought I did.
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!	Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?	Nothing.
What in bloody hell is going on?	They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.	From Interpol?	That's him.
Lose them!	You lose them!
About time!	Not yet...
Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?	They're good!
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.	Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.	You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...	Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
Do I need to repeat myself?	No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.	You were a soldier, were you?	Once.
Hazard pay...	The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...	We weren't real thrilled about it either...
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?	I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.	I still am.	Is that right?	That's right.
Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk.  You know, a bonus.  But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you.	Nobody's saying they don't.	And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.	I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.	You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.	"I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  ""Send the girl to do it.""  ""Tell The girl to take care of it.""  ""Have the girl fuck him.""  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less."	You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.	Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
I better be getting that.	Duty calls?	Just business.
Now, what did we steal?	I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.	Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.	Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...	That we're too stupid to trace his calls.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.	Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?	I'm a patriate.	Don't even think that I'm buying that.	Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.	I didn't say I was.	Bloody fucking hell...
Are you alright?	Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.	Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
Who are you?  IRA?	Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?	These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
It's quite satifactory.	Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.	I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...	You sure about this?	I'd stake my reputation.	But would you stake your life, that's the question...	In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?	I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.	Next.
Alright, Gregor, I'm...	Ready when you are...
Where's the case?	There's a problem...
That fucking figures...	Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.	Don't do it, Sam!	Shut up!	He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.	I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.	That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.	I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.	We'll double your price.	Really?  Do you have the money with you?	Do you have the material?	You first, Edvard.	Perhaps we could both go at the same time...	I think not.  After you...
Do you have it?	Not so fast.  Who's that?	He's company.	Bad company...	What do you mean?	He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
Here's yours.	There's been a slight problem.	What's that?
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.	I take it you still want the money...	Of course.
Where's my information?	In here...	Then you better find it in your heart to tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be.
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?	No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.	Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.	Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.	I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.	Enough!
And more importantly --	I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
We'll die if we stay here!	You'll die if you leave here.
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.	I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!	It is, I'm telling you it is!!	You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.	But you hate each other!	What's a little hate between business partners?
So, you've got it all figured, do you?	Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.	I think not.  I have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens.  Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off.
Whoever hired us.	I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.	Now that is an interesting proposition.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.	I don't have it with me...	Bullshit!	I swear...	Then where is it?	I sent it to myself in Paris.	Sent it where?	A post office box.
Is it done?	It's done.
Gregor, is that you?	Much to your disappointment, no doubt.	It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.	I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!	So what do we do?	What I do is none of your concern.  What you should do is wait for my next phone call.  I'm going to find a place where I can tilt the field in my favor.  When I'm ready, I'll call you and tell you what I want you to do.
How so?	Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine.
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.	I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.	A means to an end, is that it?	That's it.	Then I guess we're set.	There is one other thing...	What's that?
What are you doing?	Don't cross me...	Nobody's going to do that!	Really?	I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!	I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.	I do, I do...
Hello, Jean-Pierre.	Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
He's tough, your American friend.	Yes, Sam's tough alright.	And you respect him.	Of course.  Don't you?	I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?	Not exactly.	Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?	How did you know?	If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
American.	Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
Are you sure you won't have a drink?	No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.
You think you can stitch me up on you own?	Don't worry, we'll take care of it.	Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.	You should really let a doctor look at that.	Soon.	But first you have something to take care of?	Yeah.	Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?	It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.	Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
He sees this differently, as you well know.	I didn't expect that he would.	You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.	Vincent told you that I'm a cop?	Not a word.  But no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do.  And so I place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me.  You work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop.
So this is what, a test?	Call it a reckoning of character.
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.	Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
So what is it you want to know?	I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.	Created?	Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.	Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.	You seem one to me.	A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.  The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival.
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.	Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
You shoot alright.	Gets the job done.	All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.	Not for long.	Long enough to shoot back.	Is that right?	It's been known to happen.	Why don't you go do better, then...
Yeah, well...  My way works too.	My way is better.
It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.	Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?	Did he bring that with him?
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.	What a surprise...	I got a surprise for you, blondie...
They call me Swede.	Who's they?	Everybody.
You should watch what you eat.	Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?	I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.	And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?	Who you calling dumb, dickless?
I ride with fat-boy...	Eat shit and die slowly...	After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.	I blast the lead car into oblivion...
Where is this broad?	You should learn a little patience.	Is that right?	It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.	Not in mine.
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.	I don't think so.
Sorry I'm late...	What makes you think we're here to meet you?	Who else would you be?
Perhaps the police?	I know cops -- and you're no cop.
Cigarette?	No thanks.
He trusts you to lock up?	Let's just say he knows who I am.
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.	Coordinate what?	Things.  This is my country, you know.
Where to?	To see a man about a thing.	I can do that.
Pretty much what you'd expect.	That's what I thought.
He says this is their block.	As in, they own it?	Something like that...	And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?	I didn't know that you spoke French.	I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
What'd you say to him?	I asked if we could give him anything else.
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?	Jujitsu.	Same thing, isn't it?	Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.	What's the difference?	One's a lot more painful than the other.
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?	I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.	A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?	I do.	Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.	It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.	There is that.
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.	Like Larry or Swede.	Exactly.  Why not bring them?	Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.	Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.	So is the woman.	Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.	I wonder if she truly left the IRA.	I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?	I wanted to see who you were.	Who am I?
You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.	That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.	They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.	Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
Lovely, isn't it?	They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
What's going on?	I just wanted to see something.	See what?
I needed to know.	You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.	I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...	Well I ain't a cop.
How did you know?	Know what?	That there was a gun pointed at me.	I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.	But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?	Because that's what I would have done...
The question still remains: what do we do now?	Gregor's cell phone...
What's going on?	You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
I came up here to sneak a smoke.	You were smoking?	I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.	Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.
I borrowed that, too...	Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.	I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
It was at that.	A lot of people died.	I've seen a lot of people die before.	I haven't.  Not like that.  How do you get used to it?	You don't.  You just learn to live with it.	I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.	We live in a singular world, my friend.	I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.	You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I got a feeling you cost more than two bits.
He's going back.	Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.	It's Paris.  The route's too indirect for anything else.  A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now.  He's going to Paris.  Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.	But you can't.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.	I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.	You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.	You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?	No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.	No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.	Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.	Not exactly.	You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.	If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.	And what job is that?	My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about.  I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point.  It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.	We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.	I'm going with you.	This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.	It isn't about money for me, not anymore.	You don't have to do this.	Yes I do.
Alright, it's done.	You see the bullet?	Clearly.	Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
You know him?	I know of him.
The Irish representative?	Yes.
What's this?	The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.	Thorough man.
You sure your friend got the right place?	If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?	Do what?	Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.	It's my job.	Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.	Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.	It's a cover, then.  A cover within a cover, a feint within a feint.  You work for the CIA, it's the only possible answer.
I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed.  I do dark ops.	Dark ops?	Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.	Very ugly.	It is at that.	Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.	I never made that claim.	I know.  Jean-Pierre did.	You were behind the door?	I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.	You would have done that?	I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.	How could you have done that?	Because I owe you.  Look at that...
They don't have the package.	You think?	You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
What the fuck happened?	I don't know...	You don't know?  Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out.
Give me a cigarette.	Right now?	Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!	Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
I'm not here very much.	Business keeps you on the road?	Something like that.
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.	So I do it.	No you don't, and you know it.	If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?	In a minute.	I think not.
Do we need anything else?	Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
Not here.  They might see it.	If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
Time to quit.	Just like that?	Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.	What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.	Would you stop with that...	Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.	The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.	Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.	Because I don't walk away.	Why not?	It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?	Closest and oldest.	And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.	And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?	That's a good question.	Do you have a good answer?	No, I don't.
You have to stop doing that!	I'll work on it...
Let's get him out of here...	Finish the job...	And now...	Finish it!
You son-of-a-bitch...	What?	You speak French.	What of it?	Nothing...
"""Your field dressing saved his life."" That's three I owe you."	You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.	I know.	You better get some sleep, alright?	Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?	I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.	What happened to it?	Gone.  Destroyed.	I guess that's for the best.
I told you, I quit.	Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked.
What's the story?	It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
Gaelic.	You sure?	I'm sure.
Why's that?	Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.	It's the Irish tape we want.	Gonna be tough.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.	Seamus Reilly.
Why didn't you kill her?	Why didn't you kill him?
You slept with her!	How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
You slept with her!	You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...	You put everything on the line because you...	You slept with the fucker!!
My man, how you doing?	I'm alright.  And you?	Doing well.  This is?	A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.	Why don't we step into my office...
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.	Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
Do you have the tape?	I might know where you could get a copy.
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.	You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?	All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
Can you get it?	The Russian would be easier.
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.	I get the picture.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.	I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.	It's a matter of respect.  Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.
Sort of!	Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
What the hell happened here?	Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?	None of them had any --
Damn.	I want to get some hounds down here.
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?	I can't get enough of it.
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!	Dwayne listen to me -	Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?	I don't know what you're -	Don't lie to me!!!!
Ready to roll, partner?	Sure thing, and --
Don't spend it all in one place.	I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?	The horniest dog in Nevada.
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.	Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.	I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.	I hear you.
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.	Seven thousand...	He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.	Cash and what?	Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...	Never heard of it.	Oh, you would have done great.	I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.	That's what everyone thinks.  But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.
What the hell...	They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
Ten thousand right here.	There must be over a million dollars in here.	Shit, more than that.
What are we going to do?	What do you mean what are we going to do?	I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
Call it in I guess.  Why?	Why?  Are you kidding me?
No.  We can't.	Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.	We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?	Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!	We don't know that.	Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!	Well someone's gonna find them.	Hell, it won't be us!
It won't work.	Why?	I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!	We'll figure something out.
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!	Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.	Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?	It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?	I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!	What makes you so sure?	Because...I know.
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.	Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?	That's right!	At the expense of six people.	They killed themselves.  Besides, they were breaking the law.  What they were doing was wrong!  Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?	Maybe.  Who cares?
I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!	All right we will.
We'll torch the bases, how's that?	Torch it?!
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.	I don't know.
I've got one condition.	What's that?
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.	Well, we won't do any of that shit!
Shhh!	What are you gonna do?	Well, I don't know.  I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?	He saw everything!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!	He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.	What are you thinking?
I don't know...	You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...	Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.	I...I can't do that.	Okay then.  I'll do it.	That's not what I mean.	Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --	I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!	Well we didn't kill him, he died on his own.
Look.  Dwayne was right.  This is going to be a big story.  So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around.	Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.	"Forget it.  We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it.	 Understand?"
We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead...  What are we going to do?!	I don't know...	This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...	That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us.	Well, we didn't know that at the time.	We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.	No we didn't.  He died on his own.	Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.	Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.	It's the right thing to do.	It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!	Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!	He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.	What are you thinking?	I don't know...
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.	"Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway."	I can't do that.	Okay then.  I'll do it.
That's not what I mean.	Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.	He would have done it to us, right?	Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!	All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!	Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.	Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
...Or get rid of the money.  I don't know.	I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.	And how do you figure we do that?	All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.	He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.	Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
He's going to be trouble.	He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?	For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
You said that last time!	Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
You're out of your mind.	Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
You think he's bluffing?	No.	Neither do I.
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...	If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!	Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.	I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.	Well what are we supposed to do?	I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
You're crazy.	How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?	Not bad enough to kill him.	Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
How long is it going to take?!	I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
What are you thinking?  We were only supposed to scare him!	I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
Here it is.	There it is...now what about the others?
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!	You killed him...	It's gonna be o.k.	Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...	We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!	You don't know if he was really gonna --	Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
Maybe we should say somethin'.	Come on. Booth grabs the bag --	Do you have everything?	I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?	It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?	I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.	Then we're screwed.	No we're not.
We're not?  How do you figure that?	We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.	We've got to go now, then.	That's right.	Then Sally comes too.
Oh Jesus...	He killed her...he killed her...	What happened?  What's Earl doing here?	He found us, he shot her...he killed her...	Booth, listen to me...Booth!	He killed her...
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!	No.  It stops now.  It stops here.	What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.
Dwayne's dead.	I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
What are you talking about?	Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  He was at the scene.  He grabbed the cash.  Of course.  This is perfect!
It's too late...	It's NOT too late!	Yes it is.  I'm calling it in.  Right now.
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.	It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.	I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.	Uh huh.	And you're solid on that?	Rock solid.
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.	Why don't you get to the point.	My point, well...
Listen Earl.  I covered for you. For both of you.  I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!	What's your offer, Jesse?	My offer?  Well I'd say it's a fair one, like I said we're friends.  All I want is my share, which I guess is...
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.	All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.	I'm all ears.	We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
Well, I don't know...	That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.	How much?	I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?	Two thousand...	By Friday.
There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.	What are you proposing?	I want my share. All of it.
I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!	None of us like it!	Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.	Just take it in stride.	I'm not gonna take --  I'm not gonna take it in stride.  I had a good run turn to shit on me like that -  cleaned me out.
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.	No.  It's not.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?	You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!	Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!	You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!	Shut up, Jesse.	HELLLLLP!!!!
Whoa, Earl!	OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!	What are you doing, Earl?
How are ya?	Hello.
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?	No.  Why?	Because someone may have gotten away.
Could it have been in the Mercedes?	Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.	You mean that guy was an agent?	Yes.  Wife and a kid.  Don't blame yourself, Deputy.  You did all you could.  You have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.	What's that?	Denning was wearing a bug.
Yeah?  So?	It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
I have to go to the bank before it closes.	What for?	I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.	Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three.
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.	He's irresponsible.
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.	Has he?	No.  But he would, probably.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...	I might have to look into that...
Hi.	Hi.	Heard you had quite a night.
Yeah.	It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.	I know.
What's wrong?	Nothing.	Nothing's wrong.	Oh.  You coming by tonight?	OK.	Are you sure you're OK?	Yeah I'm fine.	I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?	OK.  I love you.	I love you too.
Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.	I'm in here.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?	You deserve it is the occasion.
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...	Nothing happened?	Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.	He's not, he's...	That son of a bitch.	Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.	And I'd take it out on him.	And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.	There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
You're worth every last penny.	Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.	How the hell did he find it?	He started digging through my closet, something he never does.	Great...	It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.	Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.	Dammit, I'm so sick of this.	I know.	Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.	He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.	It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?	I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...	I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.	We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...	It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
So do I.	I love you Sally.	I love you.
A satellite dish?	Well I was just throwing out ideas...
How are we going to do all this?	I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.	I don't know, Booth.	I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?	Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.	Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?	It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
Why does that bother you?	I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...	Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?	I don't know.  My friends...	We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.	Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...	Yeah, it is...
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?	Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.	I don't believe it.	I swear to you, it's true...
Sally, do you love me?	You know I do.
Yeah, I've seen him.	What did he buy?	I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.	Could it have been this?
Be more specific.  A month, a week...	A week ago, at most.	Thanks for your time.
Test the product?	Yeah.	Sounds like you don't trust me.
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?	You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?	You said that, I didn't.
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?	What?	I have a better plan.
And what's that?	How about you give us what you have and leave.	What?	Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...	First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.	Don't worry the real men are in charge now.	Speaking of which that reminds me I have to bring something home or eat Sally's meatloaf again, and I don't think I could stand that.
Why?	Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
What makes you say that?	We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
I don't know.	This just might be our ticket!
What do you think about all this?	Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
I guess we can get started.	I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.	That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?	Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.	Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.	Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.	We appreciate that.
Uh, no...	Don't you think I would have told you that!
Maybe.  Maybe not.	What are you getting at?	Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.	Why would someone do that?	Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously.
Oh that was Agent Wallace.  We're going to check into something.	Maybe I should come along.
Don't you have to be here?	Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.	Mm-hmm...
We don't know.  Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.	Have you known this all along?	Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.	Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Sheriff Hogan --	Dwayne.	"Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner."	Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.	Did you say After Midnight?
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.	Is this marked money, or what?
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.	So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Yeah.	What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?	Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.	Lingerie...	Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?	Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Hello.	Hi.
Anything I can help you with?	Well I just uh, you know...
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.	Anything...specific?	Well I don't know...
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!	We are having a sale on some items over here --
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.	Hmmm...	I don't suppose you've seen her.	Have I seen her?	Shopping here?	No, I can't say that I have.	Oh.
Let's see...do you know her cup size?	Uh...C?	C?	Yeah I'd say C...C.	Do you know...34 C?  32 C?	No I don't.  You sure you havent seen her?
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.	Sure.	I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.	Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.	A lot of men come in here?	Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
Just goes to show you.	I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look.
Damn its hot in here...	He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  Id have found it in a minute.	All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?	No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.	Dammit youre persistent.  I dont want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
Aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!	Take it or leave it.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?	Sort of.
She's not his type.	Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Jesse?	Yeah whaddya want?.
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?	Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?	Why?	Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.	About what?	Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.	Uh, sure.  I hear you.	So be here at three.	I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.	I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.	Yeah...see you at three.
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?	Well I'm here now.
Something wrong, Jesse?	No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?	You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.	Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
What's this?	I don't know...
Hey where's the hot pad?	What?	Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?	I can't hear a word you're saying!	Forget it.
It was going to be a surprise!	A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
What are you saying?	I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.	Watch that.  Watch that tone.
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?	Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.	That hasn't stopped you before.
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.	I didn't say that.  You did.	Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...	Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
Don't you want to hear about my day?	Yeah let's hear about your day.	Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
Whatever...	Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!	Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.	It certainly is...
You shut your mouth you son of a bitch!	Dwayne put the gun down --	Shut up!!!  Slut!!!
You'd do this to me?!	Dwayne -	You'd do this to me!
Dwayne please calm down!	Calm down --
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.	Then what the hell are you all about?
I'll settle for a third of that.	And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?	True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl?
We're out of here.	Right behind you.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.	What?	Just do it!  Meet me there, now.
I'm not asking.	Well you're not getting, either.	Listen -
What do you mean?  You gambled it?	I was on a roll!  Im a little overextended now.	Oh Jesus Christ...	So I want the money and I want it now.	Well you can't have it.
You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.	You're never getting that much.	I think I am.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --	We're gonna talk.
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.	Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
Don't hurt me.	We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.	Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
Hi ma.	Hi.
I didn't know you were coming.	I was in the neighborhood.	Is that the mail?	Yeah.
How's work?	Well, same ol' same ol'.
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.	It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.	Did they ever find out who they were?	Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.	I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.	At least around here it does.	Are you hungry?	Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.	You do?
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...	And what happened?	Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.	And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.	That's great Earl!	Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
This whole place?	Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
Don't you want it?	Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.	Well I don't know --	You've done without it long enough, ma.
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?	Absolutely positively.
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?	Give me the bad news.	We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.	Anything in it?	Money.
But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.	There was more than that.	Not in the trunk.	That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?	Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.	So...what's the good news?
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.	So someone did get away.	I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.	No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?	"We're doing a check on the manufacturers'	serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch.  What's your take on these local boys?  Are they providing any answers?"
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.	I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!	You think he skipped town?	We're going to find out.
Yeah.	What do you think?  Heart attack?
This isn't right...	I'm not getting an answer.	Not getting an answer?  For Christ's sake!  Call 911!  Let's get it locked down here!
Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?	Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?	It's nine-thirty in the morning.	Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.	Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.	Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.	I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?	Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.	No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?	Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
What the hell is that?	Those are five hundred dollar chips.	Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?	No, I just assumed...	You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?	No, sir.	Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?
Winner six!	How much is that?	Two-hundred thousand!	Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
Winner!  Four, winner!	I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
Invitation, please.	I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.	The band has been playing over an hour.	I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
Wait.	Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?	Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.	What??  Where'd you hear that?	I got my sources.	And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.	James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?	Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.	Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.	I'd like to see you try.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.	Is this about the funny money?	How'd you know?	You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.	So tell me what you know.	I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?	Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.
What?	One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.	All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now.
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.	Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.	San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.	I don't think so.	I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.	This is your ship?	That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.	El Capitan?	I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.	Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?	Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.	"The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was ""Red Dragon."""	Red Dragon?  You sure about that?	I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.	Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.	Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.	I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.	How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
Yeah, that's right.	We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.	Look, I've been working this case for months now...	So what's your story?	They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.	It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.	How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?	In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.	What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?	The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
I'm busy at the moment.	I said get on your feet!	I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?	I'm Lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.	I don't think so...
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.	It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.	That's Chief Inspector, he got promoted.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?	I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?	Lee, you okay?
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?	C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
Oh, you American?	That's right.	You bring American money?	Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
You get massage from Chinese girl before?	No.  It's my first time.	You pick any girl for you and your friend.
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.	Oh yes, she's very nice.	She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet.
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?	I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.	Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.	Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...	Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?	You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.	You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.	That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.	Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.	Those girls drove off because of you.	All I did was invite them for a drink.	You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.	"I said that?  Which word was ""goat?"""
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.	Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.	Mu-shu?  You're hungry?	Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.	Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.	Carter, would I lie to you?
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?	No.	You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?	No.	Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold it in half.
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.	Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?	Bathroom.
Carter, get off that stage!	Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.	I knew you were lying.	I'm sorry.	Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.	No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.	Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?	Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.	Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.	No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.	You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
What'd I say?	You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.	Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.	Try to land on your feet.
You lied to me.	I'm sorry.	You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.	No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.	This won't take long.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!	Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.	I am a tourist.
Hello.	How you doin'?	My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
What are you doing?	She said I could pick any girl I want.	Well, hurry up.	Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
What's wrong?	Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.	That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.	This is a very dangerous man.	I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.	I'm calling for back up!
Goddamn you got a small ass.	Don't look at my ass!
Where are you going?	Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.	Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.	Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.	Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!	My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!	It's my job!	You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?	I have plenty of dates.	Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?	You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.	And you ain't black!
Carter?	Who died?	You.	Detective Yu?  Never met him.	Not Yu.  You!	Who?	Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?	Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?	I'm okay, you go.	Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.	Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.	What the hell is going on here?
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?	I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.	Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.	Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!	I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.	No.  She's a school teacher.	You're not very good at this, are you?	Good at what?	Forget it.
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.	Ask me if I give a shit.
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.	How the hell did Tan get away with it?	All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.	This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell, Lee, you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that, isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case, right?
No, no, that would be crazy --	"You thought the ""Customs Agents get blown up"" and ""smuggling"" and ""Ricky Tan"" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing..."	I thought you'd think it was crazy.	IT IS CRAZY!	I know.  I know.  I am sorry.
So are you getting on the plane or not?!	What?	Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.	I cannot go to LA...
It sounds impossible --	You said --	-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.	Why LA?	I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...	Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.	Follow the Rich White Man?	"Almost, but you've got to say ""Rich White Man"" all run together like it's one word."	Follow the RichWhiteMan...	Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.	Who?	Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.	How do you know he's our man?	"Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like ""Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!"	You sound like that all the time.	Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.	Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.	Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.	Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.	The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?	He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.	He'll be back soon.	How do you know?	Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.
Carter, there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.	Hey, I didn't mean to call you pathetic.	The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.	You pull a muscle or something?	My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.	I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?	It's a long story.	Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.	No.  It was my singing.	Excuse me?	She hated my voice.  Said it drove her crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it.  She finally told me it was driving her crazy.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.	Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.	I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.
Slow down, baby.	What did you say?	Nothing.  I said nothing.
Is it hot in here?	Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.	I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?	What's going on?
She's getting undressed.	Gimme the binoculars.	No.  It's not right.	Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
What's she doing?	Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...	I don't want to hear this.	Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.	Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.	She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?	What?	She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.	What is it?	No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired...
I don't understand?	She's walking back towards the door.
Pick it up!	It's your turn!	I don't need a turn!
Wait!  There's people down there!	There's people up here!	Get it out of here!	Take it!
I wouldn't do that!!!	It's a bomb.
Let me see it again?	We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.	We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.	They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.	She never even looked at you.	You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.	I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.	Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry, Lee, you never had a chance.
Are you okay?	What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.	She saved our lives.	For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.	Shhh, my head hurts.	"I'm about to be killed and you ""Shhh"" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you."	Why did you help me?	It doesn't matter.
I'm not used to having a partner.	We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.	Well we're not friends.	You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.	Fine with me.	I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.	See you in the next world.	I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.	Fine.	I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?	Yes.  We have heaven.	Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?	What's a Chinese heaven?	I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.	I think we should stop talking.	Fine by me.	You thinking about that girl that dumped you?	No.	If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.	Mind your own business.	How was the sex?	There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.	You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?	No mu-shu.	What about a little king pao chicken?	No kung pao chicken.  Never.	Steamed dumplings?	Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.	That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.	Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?	Are you serious?	Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.	I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?	That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?	They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.	Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.
Very nice.	It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.	I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
Hello, Benjamin.	Who's Benjamin?	Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.	A Chinese man discovered electricity.	No Chinese man discovered electricity.	Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.	Now that I believe.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.	End of the line.	You've been a good friend, James Carter.	Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.	You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.	Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Vegas...	Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
Red Dragon.	That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Let's go.	Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.	What is Mac out?	Follow me my Asian brother.
Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.	Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.	Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.	Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia.
Carter...here comes the rich white man.	Wait here.  I'll handle this.
Lee, what the hell are you doing?	Dancing?	Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?	It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!	No.  I'm going to find out.	Wait a second.  There's guards all over the place.  You'll need a distraction.
I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move.	Try to keep them busy for five minutes.	I'll give it my best shot.
Lee!	MMMMMM!!!!
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?	I did!	No you didn't!	Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
Ricky Tan is alive.	What?!?!	We have to get to the Penthouse.
You go after Ricky.  I got this.	Carter...	Just GO!
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.	It's worth it to me.
We made it, man.	No problem.
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.	She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
That your gate down there?	Yes.	I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.	I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.	You take care of yourself, Lee.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.	It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
What is this?	About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.	No, Carter.  I can't take this.	It's okay, I got lots more.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.	This money is evidence.	Come on, Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.	New York City?	First class.	The Plaza Hotel?	A little Mu-shu.	Some Kung-Pao?
I could use a little vacation.	Amen to that, brother.
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.	"What ""revenge"" is he talking about?"	I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?	Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --	Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.	Fine with me.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.	Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Is this a payoff?	No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.	And Hu Li killed him for the plates.	Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake.
Put your arms around me.	Excuse me?
What's going on?	I need your help.	Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.	I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
You move well.	Just trying to make it look real.	Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.	Why don't you go get them?	If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.	How do I know I can trust you?	Dip me!
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?	No.  But I'll help you.
Are you okay?	I'm fine.
I didn't know which side you were on.	Now you know.
Master Ching taught me.	The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?	No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?	Baby Duck?	That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
Do you still have the bills?	I still have my lunch money from third grade.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.	Any leads?	We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.	It's my responsibility.
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.	The Secret Service?  Why?
All he wanted was some mu-shu.	Are you okay, Lee?
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...	Did you tell Sterling?	Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.	Thank you.
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --	I'll take him.
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.	You must come with me for questioning.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --	Don't.
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.	The police can protect you.	Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.	Tell me why they killed the customs agents.	There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.	Put the plates down.  It's over.	I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did.
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.	Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?	Yes, Master.
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.	Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
He was the best I ever trained, you know.	Ricky Tan?	No.  Your father.  Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did --
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.	I know, Master, but...	The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.	Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --	"It's a massage parlor downtown.  ""Heaven on Earth.""  You will find your answers there."
Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.	This is still Hong Kong.	Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.	Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...	No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other?
Who the hell is that?	That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.	Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!	"Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my ""still""."
You know what a phone booth is?!	The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
Lee!  It's him!	The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.	Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?	In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.	That's some serious poundage in dollars.
What is your name?	That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.	Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.	Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!	Shut up!	OK. Say what it is.	The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.	Sir, I can explain.	What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.	I know, but --	That's probably the only reason Johnson's still alive.
Good job.	Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.	I got a call from the F.B.I.  The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.
Feds asked for me?	They asked for the best street man I had.
And that, of course, would be me.	Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.	Carter.
He stole my wheel!	This is pathetic.	I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!  Your ass is goin' to jail!
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.	Tell me about it.	He was just doing his job.	So was I.
You talk very fast.	Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
Beach Boy.	You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!	Beach Boy America.  Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my --
Help me Rhonda.	Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
You have one of these?	No.	Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns.  That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.
You speak English!	A little.	Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.	I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.	It's the same thing!	I am not responsible for your assumptions.	You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?	Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.	Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.	We are both full of shit.	Yeah, that's right.  Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.	Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
-- what the hell is that?	What?	That silly-ass look on your face.	I was being polite.	Well don't do that.  Polite don't work here.  You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment.
Where were we?	Witnesses.	Wait. You hungry?  You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right?  Then you gotta be hungry.  Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry.  We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate.
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.	Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.	It was not my intent --	Right....	Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.	Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist.
What about them?	I know a shortcut.	Shortcut?	You don't know what a shortcut is?
You make the plate?	What plate?	The license!  You get it?!	No.	What the hell kinda cop are you?!	Did you make the plate?!	It was my ass that almost got trashed!	He was trying to kill me, not you.	Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?	It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.	Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.	What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?	No. I just made it up.
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.	Don't go there...	I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.	Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.	I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.	Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?	Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?	Stooly.	What?	Stool pigeon.	Yeah, somethin' like that.  OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand?  OK, let's go.
You talk too fast.	Come on!
Let's go.  Everybody take off?	Took off. Yes. They took off.
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.	Thank you. I learn a great deal.	It happens.
Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.	That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.	Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.	Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
You like it?	Yeah, it's good.	That one is my favorite.  Chicken puff with shark fin.
You want more?	No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.
Now, that's American music.	Yes, I know this song.	You know War?	Who does not know War?  ³War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.²
That's not how it goes.	Yes, I think so.	No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!	Yee-aww.
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.	Good God, ya'll!	No! You hate me.  Look, I'm gonna do it one time.  That's it.
Are you OK?	I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.
Want some?	No, fish is a PM food.	Excuse me?	Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
What?!	It's him.
Which one?	Going into the restaurant.
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.	This concrete?  This is still America.	What do you hear?
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.	I am from outa town.	No, like a tourist.  You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.
Like that.	I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
No, please, I don't --	It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.	Oh yes.
Oh no, I dropped it.	You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?	I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Lee.	Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
What are you doing here?	Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
Oh no.	What?	The art.
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...	Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
Oh my god. Griffin.	You know him?
What a surprise!	FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.	It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.	No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?	Oh, I think you like this very much.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?	Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
Not anymore.	Where'd you get it?
You're killin' me here.	Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.	Oh, baby, you cruel...
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --	Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.	The Feds?!	FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?	No...what?	I could get promoted right out of here.	What's wrong with that?	I wouldn't be close to you.  What is that perfume, girl?
How'd what go?	With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.	They put you in charge?	In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.	Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?	Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.	OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.	No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
You got a lot of guts calling me.	Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.	You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!	Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
Jesus...what do you want?	This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?	This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.	Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
Oh my god...what happened to you?	It's called a dress.	It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on?
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.	What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.	Yeah, if you're Superfly.	That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
You don't like it?	It's okay. For restaurants.
You OK?	We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?	Yeah. So why you look do down?	Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.	Not to me. Never to me.
How about a lift home?	Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
Any demands yet?	At this point we don't have much.	How much they want?	You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.	Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.	Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...	He is the situation.
I'm talking about the girl.	Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
What kind of assignment is that?	Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.	Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?	Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.	What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?	Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!	Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
You understand what I'm sayin'?	Carter, shut up!
Yo, Johnson...	You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!	Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!	That's what you were supposed to be!
Hmmmm?	Don't play bullshit games with me.	Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is.  He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?	Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?	No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...	I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.	What?!	And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...	Shut up!	You a cop or something?	Or somethin'.
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.	I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.	I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.	Nobody touches me.	Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.	What are you talking about?
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?	I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?	Do it!
You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.	What are you talking about?	You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.	How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!	All I gotta do is implicate.  The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella.
You sonuvabitch.	I'm waitin' here for a name.
Where do we find him?	You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
Hello.	Ambassador Han.	Yes.	Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
My daughter.	She's fine.	Can I speak with her?
Yes.	You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.	Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --
Hello.	Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.	I want to speak with my daughter!
Hello.	Han?	Yes.	It's Griffin.	Griffin?  Where are you.
Yes.	You have what I asked for?	I do.	Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
I would like one of my people to help.	Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.	He is very good.	As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.	I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...	He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.	Carter, can I have a moment?
I am so sorry about your men.	Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.	And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?	Don't worry, he's with Carter.
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?	I still have work to do here.	I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.	I was trying to find the right time.	After I left?
I will not have friends in America.	Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
What is he up to now?	Ike just came by to check out the team.
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?	I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?	Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.	You don't understand this guy.	"Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. ""I'm not..."""	I'm not running.	So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.	I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
Right.	I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
Yes.	Let me take you back inside, okay?
Ahh.	I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
See you at the wedding.	You bet ya, Coach.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.	Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
What do you expect me to say to this?	"How about -- ""I hope you'll be very happy together""?"
You look awful.	Thank you.
Really?	I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.	Got any last minute advice?	Maintain eye contact.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.	What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?	Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.	What did he ask?
Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...	And what did you say?	How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?	Good one!  Thanks.	It happens to be how I feel.
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.	God bless you, Maggie.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.	Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.	I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?	Of course.	Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?	Of course.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.	Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
"And in a ""V""."	"Eight is good... ""V"" could be Victory."
We do it to our dog.	It's hurting.	We'll rub.
I'll get the dress.	He's here!... He's here!
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.	Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
Bob's in a hurry.	"Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? ""Be the ball."""	"""Sink the putt."""	"""Make the shot."""	"""Nothing but net."""	"""Never say die."""
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.	His hair... any color.
Rub your ears.	Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.	I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.	So?  I never returned your calls, even when we were married.  And what's Fisher doing here anyway?
-- It's for you, Ike.	What?	Journalism lesson number one.  If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.	That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.	I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.	Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
No, that's what makes you unemployed.	I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.	I already made an appointment for later today.	See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?	I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
Fisher, let him talk.	But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?	No.  No, you didn't.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.	I'm sorry, too.  Wow.  That only took us between years to say.
Maggie!	Where do you think she's going?
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living.	... Just call me when you have it.  Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater?	Or a vegetarian?	"Or does she pick ""NGB'S"" -- ""Nice Guys, But...""  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison."
Look, he's running after her.	Look, he's in pretty good shape.	Poor Ike.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.	Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
In vino veritas.	Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...	What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.	The real story on Miss Carpenter.	All the gory details.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.	It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.	This is good.  It is a good story, Fish.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.	Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.	Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.	"""Paid vindication""  That's what I call justice."	Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.	But I'll get my normal fee, right?
"Don't say ""spec"" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance..."	Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.	This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?	No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?	I don't know.
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.	You're coming here?	Yeah.	Then come for dinner.	Okay, we'll order out.	Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...	Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
Of course we are.  Of course.	Then you'll be my best man.	Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.	Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
I have no idea what I'm doing.	Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!	I just found out I'm best man!  I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?
Get this man a Kamikaze.	Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.	And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.	Thanks.	She's a cacophony of contradictions.	Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.	Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.	Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?	Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.	Neuter a locust, feed the world.
"Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A ""man-eater"", ""a devouring death goddess."""	I don't think that's why she ran.	Why do YOU think she ran?
I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I was on the wrong track.	And you defending her?	No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.	Unbelievable, she got to you.	Oh, please!
Sorry, no.  I just got one.	Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.	Yes, Mrs. Pressman.	It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.	I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.	Good fact.  Well, you let me know.	Oh, I will.
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.	Tootaloo.
It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.	No, I'm not.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...	Are you a reporter?
What?	It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.	About her upcoming wedding and all.	No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?	Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
And you are?	Looking for Maggie.	Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.
I think you'd look good in red.	No, she's talking about your hair.
"Have you listened to his morning show, ""Wake up with ballplayer""?"	Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.	This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.	That must have made you proud.
It's nice that they're still friends.	Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Yes, I am.  And who are you?	Betty Trout.  Five dollars.	Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --	-- The luau for Maggie.
Your two cinnamon rolls.	Bye, Betty.  Thanks.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.	Thank you.	Oh, come on.  You're practically family.
They made me put my hat back on.	Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?	Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.	You know, your daughter seems...
Like her mother.	Ah, beautiful.  I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...	Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.	Originality is my speciality.	Excellent.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.	You'll answer my questions?
Getting nervous?	Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?	Yes.
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...	You have one?
Did something happen to make you care about reality?	"Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to ""poor bastard number four"" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do."	You're going to be very disappointed.	We'll see.	I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
That's fair.	Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
Everest.  Is that right?	Twice...	Really?	Without oxygen...
How romantic.	We think so.	Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.	A pre-wedding luau?
Give me that!	But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.	He is not!
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?	You can turn that finger around.
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.	Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.	How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.	I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.	Really.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.	Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.	You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?	Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Too much.	Seven-fifty.	Five hundred.	Six-fifty.	Done.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.	Cindy the manicurist.
I think so.	I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.	Maybe someday.	You afraid to try?	No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.	Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.	What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
Always a mood killer.	Still sweet.
"It's a little ""Silence of the Lambs"" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run."	He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.	Highly suspect.	What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!	Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
I'm a work in progress.	So?  Is that what you said to her?	"No.  I think I said something eloquent like, ""So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"""	Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
I don't know.	You don't know.	No.	Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.	Agreed.
You look... uh... You look fine.	Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.	Bob will be very happy.
I'll have the same.	Of course.	What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?	You know, there's no...
Ike... Hi, Grandma.	Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
"Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is ""King of Blue""!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?"	It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.	It's valuable.  Hang onto it.	No.  You take it.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?	No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.	Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.	Can you fix it?	First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.	Of what?	Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
Kind of isolated.	Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.	Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
Where did you disappear to?	Missed me bad, huh?
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?	Excuse me?	Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?	Yes.	I don't and I don't think you should...
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.	You humiliated me!	No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.	I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.	Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
It's fun!  It's high.	Or the sexual habits of locusts?	That was very interesting research George was doing!	What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?	I already explained about that.	And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?	Brian told you that?	Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.	Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.	Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.	Lost!	That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.	What!?	With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.	That's called changing your mind.	No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.	Yes I do!	No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.	I'd rather not.	Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.	I kissed him back.
About a minute...?	A little longer for me.	Really?
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?	I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.	Me, either.
I love you.  I love you.	I love you, too.
To who?  Are you asking me?	Me?
Yes, you!	Well, you do have the dress.	And the church.	And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.	I'm okay with that.	So am I.	So, we'll...
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?	I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.	It's something I've always wanted to do.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?	I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
Does it matter?	I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.	Yes, I did.	I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
Used?	They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.	This is getting serious.
You were not.	"I was, because if you said ""yes"" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?"	I'm listening.	"""I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me""."
Pretty good speech, Maggie.	I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?	Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
You're a goddess!	I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.	Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
Reporter?	Yup!
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.	She's the boss.
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.	For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?	That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.	It's probably because you got him fired.	Ya think?	Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.	Where?	"Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those ""sources say"" things."	He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.	Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?	Yes.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.	On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
I'm going to kill myself.	Why?	"Because you think I'm all like... ""Hey man, check me out""."	"No, I don't think you're like, ""I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you"".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery."	But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!	No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.	But I'm weird.	No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.	Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.	I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?	Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.	It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.	Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
Lighten up, wahine.	Lighten up, what?	This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.	I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.	Would it?
He's going to be the pastor?	Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.	What happened at the luau?	... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?	It's for the bell.
Grandma!	See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.	"No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a ""V""."	You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.	Not eight...
Let's go.	No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
You okay?  I'm closing.	I'm just finishing up, too.	Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?	No, I'm just going to head home.	Okay.
What are you talking about?	Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.	Thank you.  You still think that he was....	Quick.  Very quick.
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.	Not this one.  This one's on me.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.	Good boy, Port Hole.	His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.	I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
I'm really rooting for this one.	Thank you, Dad.
What?	Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.	Maggie, it's just a joke...	No.  It's my life.	A harmless joke.	No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
"""What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar.""... I can't ready anymore."	"""And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground""  Holy moly."
You tell Maggie.	No, you tell her.	No, no.  You're her best friend.	No.	You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.	Yeah.	Maybe she hasn't read the paper...
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.	Is there somebody else?	Nope.	You don't love me, is that it?	Nope.
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.	That's good.
You take the microwave?	What am I going to do with a microwave?	You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.	So you're angry.  Big deal.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.	He's got a houseboat.	I hate boats.	It sounds nice.	Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.	Houseboats don't go anywhere.	Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.	It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.	But it's on the water.	It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.	I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.	No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --	-- who's married to --	Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --	-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --	And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --	-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --	I hope he doesn't get out his slides.	Am I what they had in mind?	They're going to love you.
Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --	He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --	My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
Is that all right with you?	Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.	I love you.	I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?	Nope.	Even when you were young?	Nope.  Not even when I was young.
You sure you don't want to drive with me?	How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.	I'll wait.	Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Happy New Year, darling.	Happy New Year.
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?	Walter, I'd love to --	We'll stay at the Plaza --	Go for a walk in Central Park --	Go to the Symphony --
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.	What is it?	It's delicious, trust me.	Does it have wheat in it?	I don't think so.
Who is it?	Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.	I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.	That doesn't make any sense.	I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?	Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.	When you get back, I'll be gone --	And then I'll see you in New York --	Okay, okay.
You go.	Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.	I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?	What?	About forever.	No.	Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.	You couldn't.	I do.	It's just like my grandmother's china.
Walter.	It was my mother's.	It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated.
Beautiful view, isn't it?	Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --	-- it was a betrayal.	Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...	So what happened?	I told you.  Nothing --	At the top of the Empire State Building --	I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.	Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.	I think that's what I'm saying.
You okay?	Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
Oh!	What?	Look!
You should write something about this.	About what?	Whatever it is.
It's not true, but it feels true.	There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
What was that about up there?	What was what?	What's with you?	Nothing's with me.
"""Sleepless in Seattle""?"	That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.	And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.	Actually, he sounded nice.	Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.	Not.
You're a basket case.	They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...	... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.	"""Dear Sleepless and Son..."""	It sounds like the name of a mattress store --	"""I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows"" --"
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.	"I know that.  You think I don't know that? ""I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."""	You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?	I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.	Right.	I should say something in this about magic.	What?	I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?	Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.	"""I want to meet you..."""
"""On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."""	Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
"You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says ""vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied"" --"	You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.	He lost all the weight... there.	That's impossible.  A guy can't --	Can too.	No.	Yes.	And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?	Plus he fell in love with a temp.	Listen to this, I love this part --
Men never get this movie.	I know.	Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?	I always wondered about that too.
Hello.	Turn on your radio!	What?	The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.	You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.	Definitely.
Did you talk to him?	I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
You told a lie and got on a plane.	That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.	Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.	Becky?	What?	Is this crazy?	No.  That's the weirdest part about it.	Thank you.  I love you.	I love you, too.	Good night.
You were standing in the middle of the street?	You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?	I love that dream.	That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.	But he saw you, right?	He said hello.
It's a sign --	It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
You don't know who she was, Annie --	I saw her.  She looked just like this --
This is a photo of hair.	Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
Becky?	So I mailed your letter.	"""Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."""	M.F.E.O.?	Made for each other.
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.	I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.	What about the letter?	It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
You're going to miss the train.	No, I'm not.	What are your plans in New York?	We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.	I love the symphony.	"I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is history."
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...	Okay.	She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.	Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--	No, I know that part --	So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --	No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --	A sense of humor.	I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.	Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.	No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.	You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
Honey, he wasn't right for you.	I know.	He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.	I know.
Maybe you should see a shrink.	I want my money.	Go home for the weekend.	That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.	And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
Please --	This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
This is a complete disaster.  I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --	How am I going to explain this to Walter?
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.	Come on, Jonah --
Are you Annie?	Yes.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.	Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?	Howard.	Howard.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?	What?	I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --	I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.	But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?	Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.	I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.	It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.	I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?	Yes, I did.	Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.	Any time.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --	Walter and I are engaged!
It's probably just the flowers --	We'll move them --
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --	Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.	I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.	I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?	Are his folks nice?	You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.	How did it happen?
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.	How amazing.	It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.	Destiny takes a hand.	Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.	Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?	It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.	What?	You know.	What?	Magic.  It was magic.	Magic.	I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --	Mom!	Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --	Mom, we already...	Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?	Like... clockwork.
So you'll get married in a new dress.	It's a sign.	You don't believe in signs.
Sure you do.	Sure you do --
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...	Magic.	Magic.
Hello.	Hello.
Hi.	Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?	Shhhh --
It's you.	It's me?	The one in the street.  I chased after you.
Which means --	The cabinets have to be redone --
Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?	Grace heard it.	Grace the dispatcher.  Great.	The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.	Why me? What about Jay?
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.	Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Hello.	Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.	I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.	Who is this?	Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.	Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.	I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
All righ...	Good.  How long ago did your wife die?	It's been about a year and a half.	Have you had any relationship since?	No.
Why not?	Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --	And I don't want to invade your privacy --
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...	What's she talking about?
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?	It's hard to imagine.
What are you going to do, Sam?	I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
What was it that made you know?	I don't think I could really describe it.	Why not?	And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling.
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?	It's not that late in Seattle.	Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?	It's not for me.  It's for my dad.  I think he needs a new wife.
You don't like the one he was now?	He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.	Where's your mom?	She died.
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.	I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.	And you're worried about him.	I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
No.	Why not?	It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.	You want me to talk to him?
Is he home right now?	Yeah.	Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.	I don't know --	I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.	Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.	Fair enough.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.	Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.	What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.	How about rapacious and love- starved?	No.	It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --	It is not --	Right, right.
Hey, my plate is full.	Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --	I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.	And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.	"You mean, like, ""He has the cutest butt""? Where did I hear that recently?"	Everywhere.  You can't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy's butt was cute.  Who the first babe to say this was I don't know, but it caught on.
When's the latest time you were out there?	Seventy... eight.	Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.	I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.	Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.	What's tira misu?	You'll find out.	What is it?	You'll see.	Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.	You'll like it.	This is going to be tougher than I thought.
Dad, could you close the door?	H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
Write her.	You think so?	It's Y. O. H.	Yeah.  What's that?	Your only hope.
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.	I don't get it.	You have to go to her, Jonah. You have to find her.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?	Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?	Eighty dollars.	I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.	But how am I going to get there?
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?	Window.	Do you want a fruit plate?	I don't know.  Do I?	I'd rather die than eat on an airplane.  I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything.
Dad --	What is it?	There's somebody on the phone for you.  His name is Sam.
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.	I don't think I have to now.
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --	It's a spice rack.	We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
Dad?  About last night?	It's never happening again. Right?	Right.
Not.	My feelings exactly.
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?	It plays in 50 states.	What?!	Nobody else is going to know it was us.	You're right.  You better hope so.
Dad, I don't know about this one --	Oh, you're changing your mind --	No, I'm not, but --	What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?	Dad --
Does red pepper go under R or P?	P.  Dad?	What?	I forgot to mention.  Jed called --	Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?	Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
Fine.  Fine.	So I can go.	Sure.  Looking good.	Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?	I think I know how to have a spice rack.
I'm sorry.  I'm just --	Stressed.	Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?	"They called and asked for it.  ""Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."""
How did they get our phone number?	You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
"""Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF""--  What is that?"	Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.	"This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  ""Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa."" Where is that? --"	Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?	Somewhere in the middle.	I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --	She's willing to fly anywhere.
She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!	Dad, you're not taking this seriously.	This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?	English muffin.  How do you do it?	You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --	-- a slice of pizza --	But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.	It doesn't.  They ask you.	I'm starting to notice that.
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?	What do you think?	Will she scratch up your back?	What?
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.	Whose show was this on?	Jed's got cables.	Go to sleep.
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.	It's nice to meet you, Jessica.	"Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says ""Paul is dead."""	I know.	How do you know?
It was sinking.	What was?	Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.	You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.	Bye bye blackbird.	Is that what she used to sing?	I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?	I don't know.	Like do you believe in heaven?	I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?	I'm starting to forget her.	I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.	Good.
This one's for both of us.	Sleepless and Son.  Baltimore.
Great.	I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut.	This is a good letter, Dad.	The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.	Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.	Now I'm late.  Bye.
Listen to this --	Not now, Jonah --	"Just this one part, okay?  ""I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"""	Jonah, I'm leaving --	"WAIT!!!  -- ""and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore.""  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest."
Dad!	Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.	It's a sign.	Oh, right.
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed.	She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.	Perfect.  We'll be there.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --	There she is.
Why is she bringing that bag?	She's going to cook something for us?
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.	It's only ten o'clock.	Jonah!	Okay.	Thank Victoria for dinner.	Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.	I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.
Don't ever do that again.	I thought I saw a black widow spider.
What are you doing up?	I was thirsty.	There's a bathroom upstairs.	The water tastes better in the kitchen.	That's true.  Why is that?
Did you call that radio station again?	No.	Everyone at work heard you.	I just called for a second.	Long enough to call Victoria a ho.	It's a short word.	This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.	If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.	Was Mom an adjustment?	I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
God, she's beautiful.	Victoria? She's okay.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.	Who is Annie?	The one who wrote us.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.	I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
Have you seen my wallet?	It might be in the kitchen.
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.	Are you going with her?	Yes.
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --	This is the one I like.
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.	Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.	What's wrong with Annie?	Shut up.
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.	This conversation is finished.	You said we could go to New York.	Did not.	Did too.	I can't know what I said, but we're not going.	I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.	Get out.	No.	Goddammit, I am sick of this --
What if I couldn't get to you?	I was scared of what you were gonna do.	When I found you?	If I didn't go.	Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?	No.	I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?	No.
I can't believe you flew first class.	It was all they had.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.	Okay.	What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?	Sure.
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.	Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
Do you like baseball?	Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?	What about camping?	What about it?	Do you like it?	I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.	We ought to start camping again, Dad.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.	Well...	I think they're announcing your flight.
Hi.	Hi.  Sam?	Yes?	You must be Jonah.
We live two piers over, don't we? Number 12, right? We're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by.	Thanks, but... we've got plans.	Well, here's the number.  If you ever find yourself Sleepless, give us a call.  We also... do babysitting.
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?	Microwave.  Five minutes.
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.	Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.	I'm sorry --
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?	He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
You saw her in the airport and then here?	I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
How's Jonah taking it?	It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --	You're kidding --	Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
It's a little derivative.	What do you mean?	"""An Affair To Remember."" Did you ever see it? Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.  Before that it was called ""Love Affair With Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."""
Anyway, Victoria's nice.	Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?	Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
Hi.	Hi.
You look good.	You look good yourself.
I thought you were never going to call me.	You did?	I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --	You could have called me --	No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...	You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.	Oh.	So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --	I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --	I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
Is he there?	No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.	Absolutely.  Right.
He's ten.	He's good at it.	I read an article about this ...	I read the same article...	It takes time --	Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?	Sure.  Sure.
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!	Why didn't you give a warning signal?	Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?	Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?	You're welcome to one.	No thanks.	The men would like to know who this gentleman is.	That's none of their affair.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?	No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?	There's nothing stopping you.
Mornin'.	How's it going?	Well, those new fellows you hired from out of town -- we brought 'em up here in a truck this morning, but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail.
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.	Whose side are you on anyway?	Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
Well?	I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.	You haven't tried locking them up!	You want 'em all arrested?	No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?
Got any more ideas?	I don't make policy.
Take a drink. Calm down!	I say we gotta take action. Now.
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?	It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.	No, no, it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?	You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
How goes it?	It never ends.
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.	Yeah.
It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.	The woman question?	Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.	So? What does he want to do about 'em?	He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.	What do you mean -- sex equality?	You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?	You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.	Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.	So much the better.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.	He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.	You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.	Who? A scab?	An American.
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.	You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...	You're a liar, Pancho. A no-good, dirty ...
Are you sick, Mama?	No, Estellita.	Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?	Later. When I finish the ironing.
Mama, can I put the candles ...	Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
Why are they singing, Mama?	They are singing for me.	Can we light the candles now? On the cake?	Yes. We will light the candles.
To the mine?	Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.	No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.	Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.	Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.	With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.	It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen	I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
Where you going?	Got to talk to the brothers.
This water's cold again.	I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
Forget it.	Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.	Do you think I like living this way? What do you want of me?!
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.	What?	We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.	What's more important than sanitation?	The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.	I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.	Now don't start talking against the union again.	What has it got me, your union?
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!	All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...	Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?	If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!	Never... never... never!	Aaah, what's the use?
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?	I'm a fool.	No, no ...
Was it expensive, the beer?	Antonio paid for it.	Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.	I did forget. Luís told me.
What's the matter?	It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
Mother of God ...have mercy ...	Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
A fighter, huh?	He was born fighting. And born hungry.	Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.	He'll have it good. Some day.
What were they saying? About you? In there?	They say I am no good to you.	You are no good to me -- in jail.	I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.	What makes you so sure?	Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
Let them take it!	Over my dead body.	I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.	But it's yours. I won't let them ...	Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.	No.	But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...	The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.	Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.	She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.	NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.	There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.	Anglo husbands can also be backward.	Can be what?	Backward.
You all right?	Sure.
Must've been some experience for you, huh?	Yes.	I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?	I'm going back tomorrow.
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!	I've had them since the day they were born.
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.	Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
How do you feel?	I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.	Four nights. How did you sleep?	We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?	No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.	No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
We've got to have a talk, you and me.	All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.	A meeting?	Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
I waited up till midnight.	You weren't waiting for me.	That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?	Be still ...	But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
Tell me.	We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.	No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
Where are you going?	Hunting.	When?	Sun up.	Alone?	No.	Ramón -- you can't.	Why not? I'm not needed here.	But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.	Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.	Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.	And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?	It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.	Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.	You mean you're ready to give up?	Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
Ramón were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.	Like what?	I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...	Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!	Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?	I don't know what you're talking about.	No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?	You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?	"Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. ""Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican"" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, ""Stay in your place."" Do you feel better having someone lower than you?"	Shut up, you're talking crazy.
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...	Will you be still?	And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
This is what we've been waiting for.	What are you saying?	This means they've given up trying to break the picket line.  Now we can all fight together -- all of us.
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.	But honey ...	"Or why don't you just put a sign outside? ""No dogs or women allowed!"""
We can't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. And we've got to treat them as such.	Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.	Aw, cut it out, Ruth.	Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.	Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?	Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.	"Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, ""Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."""	Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.	Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
Go on. Spill it.	Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?	You know I don't think that.	"Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, ""Who's that? His grandfather?"""
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.	You mean Delaware?	No. New York.	New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?	No ...	Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?	Well, if that's possible ...	It's possible. Just negotiate.	Are we talking to a union spokesman?
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?	I thought maybe you forgot...	Forgot what?	It's Mama's Saint's Day.
Luís! Come down here!	Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
Where's your mama?	She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...	I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...	The what!	The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.	Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?	But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.	You've got to help around the house!	But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...	You should have helped her without being asked.
Ramón ... listen for the love of God ...	You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...	"Ramón ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ..."	You Judas ... blood-sucker ...	Ramón -- listen my kids ...	Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!	My kids don't have enough to eat!	You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?	I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.	You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.	"Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? ""Pay -- or we take it away."" Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!"
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...	What attitude?	You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.	He's a guest in my house, isn't he?	Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.	Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.	That's it?	Are you Australian?	No.	Good. I fucking hate Australians.
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?	Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.	You mind?
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.	I was talking to my wife.
Bobby?	Shhh.
What?	The spiders.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.	Yeah.	What can I do for you?	Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
What?	Come on.  Ease off the girl.
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.	Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ...
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.	Not even a guess?	
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.	How about in the house?	They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.	Did you see his hair color?	No, Why?
What is it?	Nothing, I'm trying to remember...
Ride 'em cowboy)	You like that?	Who wouldn't?	First rate, ain't it?	It's downright classy is what it is.
I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.	Why? The guys is ready to deal now.	Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.	Now that's down-right insulting.	I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules.
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.	Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
Yeah.	Everything go?	Yeah.	Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises	I ain't a idiot, asshole.	I'll see you tonight.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.	I understand. Thanks anyway.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.	I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Oh God.	Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
How?	I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
What about the guy on the very bottom?	Leave me out of this.	That bad, huh?
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.	Ouch.
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.	This man sounds like a real catch.	Oh, he's a keeper all right.	Colette ...
What?	Nothing.	Go ahead.	Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?	It's not that easy.	Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.	Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.	Then leave.	I can't.	Why not?	You don't understand.	There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.	I can't leave.	You get off on abuse or something?	Fuck you.	Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.	Because he'll kill me.
Why don't you call the cops?	Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.	That's long enough to get out of town.	I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.	How?
Oh. Hi.	What happened to your eye?	Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?	Don't worry. He's out of town.	How far out of town?	Trust me. We're safe.
"Miles Davis. ""All Blues."""	Never heard of him.	Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.	Like you?	Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.	And you admire that?	It's the only way to play.
Is that how you play?	I try.
: What are you up to?	Nothing.	What do you want from me, Colette?	I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?	It gets me through the day.	You really need to lighten up.
Look, I can't help you with Quincey if that's what you're after.	This has nothing to do with him.	So you're just attracted to me, is that it?	Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?	How much time do you have?	What is wrong with you?	How much time do you have?
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.	Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?	There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.	You don't like the tune, find another station.	What are you hiding, Danny?	Therapy session is over.
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?	No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
Who is it?	It's me.	I'm kind of busy.	Please open the door, Danny.
We been through that.	What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.	I need my paycheck.	You can still work.	He knows where I work.	Find a new job.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.	You always been this stubborn?
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.	Ass first into the world.	I been that way ever since.
Why not?	I just can't. Okay?
What's wrong, Danny?	Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.	I can't tell you.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.	They would have killed you too.	Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
Really, I don't want to.	I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
What is it?	Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.	I don't want to.
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.	Why?	Don't worry about it. Just go across the street and watch. You'll know when it's safe to go back.
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.	Danny, it's not what you think.
Colette, go.	I don't want to leave you.	Your daughter needs you.  Go.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.	That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.	These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.
How you holding up?	I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.	Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive.
Oh shit	What?	Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help.
Who is it?	It's Tom.
All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?	Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago. Said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?	I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.	Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?	You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.	Maybe I am dealing with it.	I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.	Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.	I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?	It's not too late to show her you're sorry.	How?
How the hell did we get this detail?	Guess it's our turn.
What time is it?	Twelve	Midnight?
Where to?	I know a guy.	Lead the way.
Nice day	I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?	Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.	Why's that?	My features. They're Finnish.	You don't say.	Finland is a country.	Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.	Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
I'm hurting.	You on a roll?	Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?	Sorry.	Why does it have to feel so bad?	You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
That's a good one.	I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.	I guess there's just no substitute for good genes.
So, why'd you want to see me?	Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.	See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.
What?	You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.	Don't get carried away.	I find myself in dire need of some cash.
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?	Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.	I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth ...	A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
Fuuuuuck	Can your man handle that?	I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.	Can you set that up?	Sure.
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.	10%.  That's ...
Jimmy, where do you find these people?	The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
You wanna score some go-fast?	Not tonight.
Hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?	Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.	You mean, like to throw 'em off?	Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?	Palmdale	Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?	I think on account of his nose.	You're going to have to explain that one.	He doesn't have one.	You're going to have to give me a little more than that, Jimmy.
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?	No  You think she's a tweaker?
You want a hit?	No. I'm good.
Can I ask you something?	Sure, Jimmy.	What does J.F.K. stand for?	John Fitzgerald Kennedy.	Was he the president?	Yes, Jimmy
Danny?	Yes, Jimmy.	Thanks for not laughing at me.
What's this?	Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.	But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.	You aren't coming with me.
Okay	Wait till I tell you what it is.	It don't matter. I'll do it. And you sure as hell don't have to pay me.
Why?	You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.	Hey, check it out...
What the hell is that?	It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
What?	I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
But...I've seen you.	When? When did you ever see me use?	This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?	You ever notice how I always showed up, in the middle of a binge? Left before it was over? How I sneak away for cap-naps? How when the crank came around to me, I always said I'd just done one?
No one ever noticed?	Are you kidding me? A bunch of amped -out tweakers? It was easy.
But... why? Why would you pretend?	I can't tell you.	You don't trust me?	I don't trust anybody.	And you want me to do you some big favor?
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?	Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.	I'm sorry. I couldn't.
Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?	Good for you Jimmy.
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.	You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?	That was my idea.	You never did like me much, did you Verne?  And you can't stand it that I walked out of there alive and Liz didn't. You think I'm a coward, don't you?
By not disgracing her memory!	What does that mean?	You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose.  Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
You don't understand.	Understand what?
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.	Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.	No shit?  Fuck it.  I'll send it to Oliver Stone then. He'll get them to reopen the bastard.
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.	Crank or glass?	The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?	No, I'm good.	I insist. It's delicious. Just a taste.
Not bad.	Secret recipe.
Can we talk price?	Make me an offer.	I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?	I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.	Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.	Hey, okay.
You're serious?	Anything for a dear friend.	But I just met you.	But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?	If you say so.	Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.	Why do you say that?	I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.	Hey, I was just trying to ...	I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.	Hey, I don't play that.
You want to do this some other time?	Pull your pants down.	I'm sorry?	Pull your motherfucking pants down.
Come on, guys ...	Big Bill.
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.	Big Bill
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.	What?!
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.	Please .. I don't know what you're ...	Uh-uh-uh ...
Shoot him.	Okay! Okay!
Now get talkin'	I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!	Yeah.
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.	Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.	What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?	No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?	I'll keep that in mind.
What the hell is this?	Just some buddies.	This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.	What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Cool it. We got business.	Yeah, dickhead.
I've got a hot one.	You go, boy.	If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?	Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
You got a name?	Bobby, rhymes with hobby.	What?	Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.	No last name?	It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.	God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.	Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
Danny, I'm touched.	Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
You think I'm a Judas?	Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.	Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.	Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
Thanks for not judging me.	It's not my place.	Don't you wonder why I do it?	The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
You don't find that repugnant?	Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.	Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.	Bobby laid his own tracks.  He could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. And as far as I'm concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  Now take the money.
I was getting to it.	Tell me what?
If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.	Danny, he isn't gonna find out it's you.  Domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.	When?	Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
What the hell are you doing here?	Question is, what are you doing here?	I was trying to score some dope.	Cut the shit, Flynne.	Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?	Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
You think this is funny motherfucker?	I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.	This chink have a name?	Bubba.
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.	After that ass-whipping you gave me?
What're your taking down?	Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?	Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
You've got no choice.	Whata you mean I've got no choice?	Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...	For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.	No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al?
Bullshit. He's a liar.	News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.	You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
That's because he doesn't have one.	Whata you mean?  He told me -	Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.	What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?	That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
What? Is it bad?	I'm afraid so, Danny.	Who is it?
That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.	We got the 411 on your good old boy.
Murder.  Beautiful.	Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.	Jesus.	I thought you'd be happy.	Yeah.
Danny?	My name is Tom.
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?	Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
Please ... don't do this ...	Answer the fucking question!
This the guy?	It speaks!
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.	Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.	Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.	What's he holding?
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?	Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.	Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?	Yeah.  What about him?	Turns out he's connected.	To who?	The Mexicali Boys	And what does this have to do with me?
He knows somebody ratted him.	What?!	And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.	Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
We know what's going on.	I still don't know what you're talking about.
Jimmy?	Who the hell is Jimmy?	He's the only one I told.	And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
What's on the other end of this thing?	Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.	Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.	Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
What's that smell?	That would be me.	What'd you do, piss your pants?	Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
"Who'd have thought it?  Danny ""Chickenshit"" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses."	Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.	No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
Excuse me?	Several possession charges, but nothing major.	Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?	They have. But they never found a lab.
You're lucky, Flynne.	Funny, I don't feel lucky.	We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.	What if he caps me before you can make a move?
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?	You mean the menacing red car?
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?	Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
When is the deal going down?	I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.	Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
Nervous?	With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.	Thank you.  Thank you very much.	And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.	Again, I thank you.	I was talking about Miles.
You, madam, are a heartless wench.	And you've got wiener breath.	Really?	It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
Tom, let's spend the night here.	There's no motels around here.	No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?	Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?	You mean like the Donner Party?	Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?	Tom, quit fucking around.	Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
You think that's a good idea?	What do you mean?	Look at that place. It's creepy.
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?	I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.	Just no pleasing you, is there?	Just admit you're wrong.	We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?	Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.	No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.	Here it comes, poor Tom.	But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.	That is so unfair.
My sentiments exactly.	Why are you doing this?
You thinking what I'm thinking?	Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.	That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.	Don't we always take good care of you?
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.	Now that's scary!
We're in business.	Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.	Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
Where's Bubba?	Maybe he isn't showing.
Danny, listen up.  Here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're getting a very special delivery a week from this Friday.	What is it, drugs?	Better than drugs.
What is that? Rum and coke?	Don't worry about it.	I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?	No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.	I thought you were done.
Find a chaplain.	...alright, let me know when.
Report.	Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.	Resistance?	A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.	Casualties?	Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.	It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.	Yes, sir.	Where are your men now?	Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.	I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.	Sir?	There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.	A private, sir?	He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.	But, sir...I...I...	Spit it out, Captain.	Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense.  Sir.
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.	The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
Good luck, John.	Thank you, sir.
So, where are you from?	You writin' a book or somethin'?	As a matter of fact, I am.	Figured.
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.	In West Fork?	In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.	No kidding.	I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.	So they travel around from place to place and preach?	We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.	What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.	The Army gave you that?	Yep.	You must be a hell a shot.	Not where I come from.
That must be four thousand yards.	Forty-two-hundred, I figure.	You take account of the wind?
Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across.	Shit, that was no big deal.
Jackson?	Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.	You got somethin' against the Cap'n?	Hell, no.  I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.	Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.	You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo.  And you think these things are comfortable?  They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.	They got squirrels there, too, right?
Last I knew.	Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.	Shut up, will you?	You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.	Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.	The hell he didn't.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?	Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
So, that's Ryan.	Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.	Cap'n...?
Yes, sir.	Of course, sir.
Y'all come back.	Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?	Hell, no!
What do you think?	I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.	I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him?
He ain't half-bad, I guess.	I guess.
He ain't Wade.	Nope, he ain't Wade.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.	Like hell, you did.
No kiddin'?	What deal?
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...	Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.	I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.	You didn't volunteer, Jackson.	I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity.
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.	I'd love to hear it.	Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on.
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.	Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.	Wade?
Where?	In the shadow by those two trees.	My guess, too.
We left them eighty-eights.	They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
Watching.	Gives Wade the second shot.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?	Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.	Who's Wade?
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.	You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?	Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.	Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Not yet.	Keep trying.
I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.	Say what, Cap'n?	You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.	Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?	It's worth it.	To each, his own.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.	White-walls?	No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.	A half-track, anything.	Sorry, sir.  Division is using everything on wheels to get up to Caen.  How come you guys aren't going?
How about that jeep?	That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.	Senator's son?	No, three brothers of his were killed in action.  Command wants him out of there.
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.	FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?	That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
Glad of it.	On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.	DASHES across the street.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...	It was nothing.	But you could have gotten killed and I...	Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
Upham?	Pass.	Sarge?
I wasn't made for this.	You think the rest of us were?
It looks like a Renoir.	Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?	I've been humming it.	I heard.	It seemed appropriate.	You know classical music?	Some.	Where are you from, Captain?
Over three-hundred.	I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.	If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.	I don't expect to live that long.
Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg.  The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor.  The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found.  The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone.	Did he see any sign of them?
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.	Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
What is it?	A machine gun.
Good luck, Captain.	Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.	The men said, nine.	What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.	That only leaves three.	Plenty.
I wonder where they're going.	Same place we are.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.	You don't count.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.	Those guns are close.
What about our grenades?	Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.	Would they notice and eighty-eight?	Sure, you got one?	The Germans do.
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.	But, sir...	There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.	Goddamn it, sir...	That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.
What'd you say, Captain?	I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania.
Captain, what about our deal?	I changed my mind.
GO!	Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!	I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
Worked, didn't it?	You tryin' to get yourself killed?	Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
Caen?	I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.	You?  Leading a squad?	Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.	What about the company?	Simpson.	Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!	I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.	Beasley's dead.	Okay, Wade.  Translators?	Fresh out.	What about Talbot?	Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport.
You get a translator, Captain?	I've got a line on one.
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.	We in radio contact with anybody up there?	Somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the Hundred-and-First's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works.  We're going in blind.
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.	Hell of a mission.	Yep, hell of a mission.
Uh, Captain...	PUSH!	Uh, Captain...
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?	That's not what we're here for.
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.	Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.	Maybe.	It's not normal, not reading letters from home.	Since when have things been normal?	You got me.  Afraid of bad news?	Nope.	Good news?
You think they'll be alright?	They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.	And what about you?
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.	Nope.	Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.	Three for three.	If we stayed, we could make a difference.	You're kidding yourself.	You never know.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.	Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.	Yup, hell of a mission.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?	It doesn't take this.
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.	Is it getting worse?	No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.	You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.	I'll be alright.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?	How about I go right, sir?	How about you take your position?
How about...?	How about you shut up and take your position?
HOLD YOUR FIRE!	Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.	About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.	More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...	Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.	Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
You alright?	Let's just find someplace.
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?	Vecchio.	Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?	Yeah.	You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?	Bits and pieces.	She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.	And what about your own hand?	No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?	It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.	Oh, yeah?	Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.	And how do you bluff yourself?	Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.	Except this time, the mission IS a man.	That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.	John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.	I think you're right, Keith.	You want me to take over?
No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me.	Just what I want to do.
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.	I know.	Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.	I'll do my best.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.	You're welcome, John.	But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.	Yes, sir.
What do you think?	Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.	What are we going to do?	We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Uh, oh.	Out of the mouth of babes.
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.	Yes, sir.
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?	Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?	Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.	Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?	Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?	Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.	Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.
I don't think so, Captain.	Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.	Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...	Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.	No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?	Trust me, you're the best.	But, sir...
Captain, can I ask you a question?	Sure, Reiben.	Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.	Yeah, how so?	I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.	There's to be a bright side, look for it.	Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.	There's always a bright side.	I'm listening, sir.	Well, I, for one, like cheese.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.	Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!	Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?	Sure, what do you want to know?	Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?	Ours is not to reason why.	Huh?	Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.	I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.	Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.	Easy for you to say, sir.  Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.	You have orders, too.
Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?	I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.	Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.	But I am a captain.  If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...
Any further thoughts on the subject?	Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.	I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead.
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.	We can't leave it here.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...	Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
Up.  We're moving out.	I thought you said we had an hour, sir?	Well now I'm saying we're moving out.  Get off your ass.
I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.	Why's that?	Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.	Except for the last part, that one's not bad.	B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.	I don't like that one.	Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.	But we accomplish the mission.	Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.	Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?	No, sir.	That's a mystery to me.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.	Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.	ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.	What if our guys open up, sir?	You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.	Have it your way, Captain.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.	You're goddamned right, I give the order.  Vote!  Jesus Christ!  Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear?
Maybe Caen.	Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.	See to it.
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.	HERE THEY COME!	OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...	Get back to your positions!
What deal?	I coach the baseball team, too.
I wonder if his cabin is still available?	That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:	Here they come.	FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.	FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.	Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
Goddamn it!	More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.	Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.	This bridge cannot be held.  The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here.  They have tanks.
The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way.  You hear me, Private?	I hear you sir, but I'm not leaving.
Thank you, sir.	Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
Yes, sir.	Alright, come with me.
I'd like to go, sir.	No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Don't do that again.	I won't need to sir, it's already here, behind the barricade so...
You set?  Sarge nods.	Yes, sir.
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.	Struggling with a pair of Germans.
Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.	Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.
FIRES THE EIGHTY-EIGHT.	Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
Yes, Private.	Upham and Jackson, what were they like?	Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.	Yeah?
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.	And Sarge?	Sarge?  He was the best friend I ever had.  Lemme tell you about Sarge...
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.	That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.	No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.	As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.	Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.	You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.	Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.	We all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...	...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that.
Shit, sir.	Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.	Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
Who cares?	I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?	Frogs?	Lingerie.	Yeah?  So?
I usually like surprises.	What are we likely to run into?
Damn fool.  Sir.	Captain, he's fast!
Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother.	Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
So, where are you from?	Get lost.
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.	We know.	Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.	He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.	Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...	Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.	What about you, Captain?
Demolition, right?	Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
How do you do it?	It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
You think he really believed it?	Who knows?  It worked.
How fast?	Twenty-four-five.	Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty- two flat.
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.	We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.	Pardon me?	Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.	What's the profile?	Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?	You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.	Don't let your father's business infect your life.	How can you, how can you say that?	Because he's guilty.	No, no he's not.	We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.	Understanding the following rights...	Speak with my lawyer.	So you refuse to answer my questions?	Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.	Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...	This evening is over.	And your former wife.
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...	What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.	Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.	That's right.	Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?	Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
Hi.	Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together?	No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.	For going to school?	Yeah, she won a fellowship.	Good for her.	I'll take the whole set.	Excellent.
Thanks, I like yours too.	Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.	Oh yeah, let me give you another card.	Okay, thanks.
Keep it.	You're sure?	Yeah, I don't want it.  Um, thank you very much.  You're very kind.
Lloyd?	Hey, sis.	I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat.  Your big graduation, and no one was there.
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.	I hope you understand.	Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.	How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?	Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.	Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?	Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?	Gee, it's easy.	Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.	I was hilarious once, wasn't I?	Yeah.	I still am.
You're tough, J-man.	He's a mess!
I'll be in my office.	I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
No, no, don't go in there.	Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.	Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?	I'll be home soon.
That's unlikely.	The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?	But you never had a first date.	Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.	That's not even a scam.	What's a scam?	Going out as friends.
Then what's love?	I'm gonna call her.	Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you.  She's a brain.
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.	Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
Look at those eyes.	Lloyd, give it up.	Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.	Lloyd.	C'mon, just do it.	C'mon Lloyd.	Please?	That's just so embarrassing.	Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front.	Okay, I got it.
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.	Hang in there, man.	Yes.	See you tomorrow.	See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
Did you sleep with her?	I admit nothing.
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.	Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.	So, what's your point?	You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
Alright.	Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.	I already did.
What does it say?	Read it.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.	Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
No, you're not a guy.	I am.	The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.	If she wants me, she can come to me.
I don't feel anything.	Come on, it's graduation.	"Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, ""You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll.""  Y'know, it's all so phoney."	He wants to leave things on a good note.	Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.	Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.	I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
Lloyd is doomed.	Meaning?	Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
I told him to be himself.	He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
Lloyd, it's us.	Look at his face, he did the deed.	You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
Wait a minute.	You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...	Wait a minute.	And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...	You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.	What?  I'm sorry, talk.	I've forgotten what I was going to say... okay, okay, I remember. Let him do what he wants.
"""Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd.""  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?"	I dream about it.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.	I just saw Joe.  He's here.	Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
Why?	It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.	What is wrong with this girl?
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.	If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.	One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?	One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.	I can accept that.	And I want to turn the home over to the state.	He'd like to start serving immediately.	I can put that together.	Confirm this with my office and my client.	I'll put this past my boss	Alright.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.	I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
That was a mistake.  The rain on my car is a baptism.  The new me.  Iceman, power Lloyd.  My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey.  If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.	Look, why don't you just call Diane again?
Visit her at the home.	I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.	Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?	'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.	Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.	Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!	You like it?	Oh yeah!	I didn't think anyone would get it.	Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!	Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.	Okay.
Ha!	Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.	Okay, I promise I will.  Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
What are you doing?	Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
God, that's... this is ridiculous.	Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.	Oh god, I don't need all these presents.  I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
They really applauded you today honey.	I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.	No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?	Everybody thinks I'm a priss.	Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...	Stop it, stop it, stop it.	I'm sorry.	I love you dad.	I love you too honey.
What?	I just had a phone call.	Tell me, is it bad news?	No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.	Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!	You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.	I won?	You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
God, I'll have to go on a plane.	We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.	No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
Morning honey.	Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.	Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?	Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?	Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...	Dad.	Now why can't I tell the story?
Well, let me start it.  I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.	I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.	Crash paranoia.
So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.	And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.	Which they did.  Let me finish.	Okay, I give up.	So anyway, these two federal marshals meet the plane, and they take our address, and they ask us never to fly with 'Friendly Skies' again.
Oh yeah.  There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.	Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
Morning.	Dad, I'm sorry.	You should be.	I was irresponsible, I should have called.	You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.	Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.	You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.	I'm fine.	Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.	I know that.
Lloyd?	Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.	Sit down.
Did he ever get rough with you?	Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.	You're going.	But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.	You're going.	It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.	Bon voyage.	You're not listening to me.	Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.	Dad, why are you acting this way?  Is this because of the other morning?
Do you love him?	I like him a lot.	Well listen to me.  Now, I know you like him, I know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh?  What are you going to talk about?  What do you have in common?  You're going to be part of an international think-tank, and he's going to be kicking punching bags.
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.	Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.	Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.	Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.	'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...	Dad, I love him.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.	Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Dad, are you okay in there?	Just finishing up in here.
What happened to you?	Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?	Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.	Swear to god, I need to know the truth.	Honey!	Swear to god.	I swear to god.	But I found the money.	Honey, it's not what you think.	What am I supposed to think?	Honey, about what?	You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?	You think you know what this money is?	Yes, I...	No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...	No, but you stole from them.	I made their lives better.	You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...	Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.	I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.	Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?	No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.	That's right, work it out.	No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.	Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.	I'm so ashamed dad.	Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...	You're right.
Hello.	Hi.	I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
Mom, please?	Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.	This is me telling you about me.	You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?	I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.	If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?	If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?	Alright.	You will?	Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Thank-you.  The real world.	Look at those eyes.
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?	Hi.  You called me?	Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.	Yeah?	Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.	Thank you very much.	Whoah, what a day, huh?	Yeah.  What a day.	Yeah.	Yeah.	Quick question - do you know who I am?	Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?	No, I read it on the message.	Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?	Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.	Busy?	Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.	Are you busy on Friday?	Yeah, I have to help my father.	Are you busy on Saturday?	Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.	So you're monumentally busy?	Well, not monumentally.	What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?	Hmmm....	Look Diane, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to leave the country without going to Valhere's graduation party.  This gentleman, he's twenty-two, and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion, and he dresses up as the Lakeside rooster, and he,
Actually, I think that I...	Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
Well...	No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.	I'll go.	Pardon me?	I'll go.	You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?	Eight.	Eight. Eight O' clock.	Goodbye.	Goodbye.
Whoa.	Would you hold this for me?	Yeah
What are these?	They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.	Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?	No.
Keymaster?	Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.	So it's an honor?	No.
So we can finally talk?	Yeah.
He does this every year?	It's the worst job since keymaster.
Thank-you.	I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
Have a good sleep.	Bye.
"Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; ""Glad I finally met you"", ""You always seemed nice"", ""Wish I could have known you more""..."	"Mine say stuff like ""Lloyd, see you around maybe"""	Nobody knew me before tonight.	They knew of you.  Now they know you.	Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.	That's cool then.	Yeah.  I'm so glad we did this.
It's just you and your dad, right?	Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.	Sure I do.	Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?	Watch out for that glass.
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...	Twisted?	You know what?	What?	You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.	Basic.  Hmmm.	So what's your job this summer?	Job?  Being a great date.	No, I'm serious.	So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.	I only have something like sixteen weeks.	Sixteen weeks is a long time.	Then call me tomorrow.	Today is tomorrow.	Then call me later.
Yeah.	Or, or I could always wear this one.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.	Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
Nice one.	Yeah?	I think you should wear that.	You think so?	Mmmm.
Oh.	I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
After work?	I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.	Won't you see me later?	I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?	Me?  Sure I do.	Come on.	Well, except for one thing.  I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat.  And they just jammed their mouths, you know?  The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me.  You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.	Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
Stop by later.	Okay, bye, I will.	Okay, bye.	I'll see you there.  Bye.
You have to meet Bess.	Okay.	She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.	Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
Yes.	What did you say?	Well... just meet her.
It's okay, everybody does that.	I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?	No.	I just can't have any social life right now.	Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.	Be friends?	Yeah.  With potential.	Friends with potential.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?	Yeah.	You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.	I'm doing alright.	Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...	Yeah?	If you'll just maybe ease it into second.	Right.
Okay, this is important...	Am I wrecking my car?	Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.	Oh.  I was putting the...
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?	Yeah.	Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?	This is so noble.	Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.
Let's get outta here.  You want to?	Yeah.
Are you comfortable?	Yes.  Are you shaking?	No.	You're shaking.	I don't think so.	You're cold.	I don't think I am.	Then why are you shaking?	I don't know.  I'm happy.	Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.	Your letter came yesterday.	It did?	Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.	Why didn't you tell me?	It was wonderful.	I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...	No, we don't have to say it.	How do you know what I'm going to say?	I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...	I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.	I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.	What?  This is a good level, isn't it?	How can I look at you and say this?	Say what?
I think that we should spend some time apart.	What's wrong?	Well, I need to study, and...	You need to study?	Yeah.	Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions.	We'll see.	Okay.  It's good knowing this.	Yeah, uh-huh.
Okay, what did we just decide?	We decided...	'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?	No, no.	It sounded like you did.	No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...	Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?	I think that we should stop going out on dates.	I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.	No, I don't, I don't.	Yeah you do.	Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.	You shared it with a dick.	No I didn't.	Is this because of your dad?	No.	Did you talk to Corey?	Why, did you tell Corey what happened?	She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.	No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.	Did you tell anybody?	Just my dad.	You told your dad?	You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.	What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.	Lloyd, I love you, okay?	What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.	Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.	Then don't do it.	Oh shit.
What do you want?	I'm sorry.	What do you want?	My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.	You do?	Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.	Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.	I love you.	What?	I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?	One more time would be nice.	I love you.  Please, I love you.
I'm fine.	Okay, good, this is all very noble.
Okay.	Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?	Okay.	So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.	Good to know.	Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.	Okay.	Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?	Not right now, thanks.
How's it going?	Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?	No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.	I know.
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.	Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
It's your castle, man.	Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.	Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.	Man, you're bringing me down!
You're freaking out here man.	You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
Yeah.	Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
YEAH!	He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?	No my brother, you have to go buy your own.	Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
PAIN!	Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
Jim Court?	Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?	Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.	Uh... okay... um...	Is this the guy with the Mustang?	No.	The guy with the Datsun?	No.	The truck?	Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.	Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
Okay, I'll give here the message.	Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?	What?	She's really pretty great, isn't she?	Yeah, she is.  Good luck.	Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.	Jim Court... no, this is her father.  I'll take...
Hi.  Lloyd Dobler, sir.  Pleasure to meet you.	Hello Lloyd.	Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.	Fine Lloyd.	How ya doing?  Is she around?	Yeah.  Honey?
Thanks Lloyd.	How do you pay for one of those?	Well, we pay for the [?].  That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?	Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.	Seriously, Lloyd.	I'm totally and completely serious.	No, really.	You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...	Go ahead, pick it up if you want.	I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something.  I'm going to give you another chance.  Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening.  Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...	Are you going to England with her Lloyd?	That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.	Are you?	Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.	Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.	I know.	She's very successful.	I know	Very talented.	I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.	You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.	I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?	I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
"""You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."""	I know this part, keep reading.	She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.	It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.	Just her name.	Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.	So what's up?	Stop freaking with her head man.  Just stop playing with her mind, you know?  She's a human being.  She's a person.  She's very talented, you know.	Dude, why do you think I keep her tapes?  They're going to be valuable some day.
My car.	Your car?
Diane Court.	Dude, I can't do it!
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.	How ya doin' Miss Evans?	You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.	No way.	Lloyd.	What?
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.	My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.	We'll just make an appointment for you at Seattle Junior College.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.	How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.	Hang tough, Lloyd.
Oh boy.	Hey.	Mike Cameron, how you doing?	What?	Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?	Yeah.	Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?	I called her up.	Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?	I'm Lloyd Dobler.	This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.	Alright.  Key?
Ooop, excuse me.	How you doin', brother?	I don't really know where we are.
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?	You know Diane Court?	Wow, man.  Well.  Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster.
Oh, I was just going to...	A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.	I was gonna...	Thanks a lot Lloyd.	I was just going to kind of move around.
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?	I don't know.	I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.	Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.	Diane, everybody loves that you showed up.
Certainly.	I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
We finally graduated, big dude guy!	Alright!
I love you man	I love you too.
Give me my firebird keys!	You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!	I love you man.	Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.	We're full on bonded.	Yeah, alright.
Later for you, Luke.	I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
Oskar - my friend Lena.	How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?	Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?	Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.	Now you're back.	Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -	Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.	He is.
Well, let's find him.	He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.	I'm talking to a clerk.
What's your name?	Sir, the list is correct.	I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.	Klaus Tauber.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.	My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
You know what, you'd like her.	Oskar, please -	What -	I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.	You would, though.  That's what I'm saying.
It's not a charade, all this?	A charade?  How could it be a charade?
Luck.	War.
What?	I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
Should I stay?	It's a beautiful city.
Should I stay?	It's up to you.
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.	I'm sorry to hear that.	There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.	I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
All right, okay, let's talk.	In Breslau.	Breslau?  I can't go to Breslau.  Not now.
We started without you.	Good.
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.	You're kidding.
He looks great, though, doesn't he? I have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  It's great.	I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -	They're not gone, they're here.	They're mine!
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -	We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -	It's bad business.	Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
Scherner told me something else about you.	Yeah, what's that?	That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.	True.
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.	Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.	I pay you too much.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.	He's important to my business.	What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.	I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.	What's going on?	I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something.
You took my workers.	They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.	When?	I don't know.  Soon.
You want these people.	These people, my people, I want my people.
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?	It's good business.	"Oh, this is ""good business"" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense."	Look -	You're not telling me something.	It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.	Yeah, sure.
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?	I just told you.	You did, but you didn't.
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.	All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
Where are the guards?	The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
What's that?	You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.	You asked for shoe polish.	My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.	So I'm responsible for the weather?	I asked for metal, you gave me glass.	This is not my problem.	Look it up.
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?	Yeah, I can.
Hey, Poldek, how's it going?  You know about the list?  You're on it.	Of course I'm on it.	You want to stay on it?  What do you got for me?
What do I got for you?	Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.	You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.	That's great.	I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.	That's great, thanks.	God bless you, sir.	Yeah, okay.	You're a good man.
Like this?	There's nothing in the stores.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?	Nice things cost money.
How many?	I don't know, ten or twelve.  That's a good color.  Dark blues, grays.
How you feeling, all right?	Yeah.	What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?	She's good.
What's wrong with it?	How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
Good.  How's it going?	Things are great, things are great.
What are you doing?	I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.	I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.	I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.	I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.	Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
Oskar, good of you to come.	Are you kidding, I never miss a party. Police Chief Rasch, my wife Emilie.	How do you do?
Thank you.	I need a drink.	Oh, God, you don't have a drink?	Wine?
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.	We're losing the war, aren't we.	It kind of looks that way.	Pistols?	Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -	No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.	What others?	Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
That'd be fine.	Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.	So I'll talk to him about it.	He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -	He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.	Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
I was just the accountant.	Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?	I think most people right now have other priorities.
"Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a ""pleasure."""	The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
Jews, yeah.  Investors.	Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.	Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product.  They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
Pots and pans.	Something they can hold in their hands.
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.	They should be.
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?	The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.	But it's less.  It's less than what I would pay a Pole.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  Poles cost more.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?	Yes.	Better this month than last?	Yes.	Any reason to think next month will be worse?	The war could end.
What?	There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
Don't ever do that to me again.	Do what?
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?	Christmas presents.	Ah, yes.
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.	Thank you.
I got to go, I'll see you.	Oskar -
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.	Are you losing money?	No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.	What other point is -	It's dangerous.  It's dangerous, to me, personally.
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...	And killing.	I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?	There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
I'll talk to him.	I think it's too late.	Well, I'll talk to somebody.  I'll take care of it.
Four hundred, four fifty -	More.
Eight hundred, give or take.	Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
That's very generous of you.	Yes.
We need to talk.	Stern.
They arrived.	They arrived, can you believe it?
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.	They're withholding payment.	Well, sure.  So would I.  So would you. I wouldn't worry about it.  We'll get it right one of these days.
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.	No?
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.	You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.	You'll lose money.
I'll talk to you later.	No, no, what, what is it?
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...	Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...	There will be generations because of what you did.	I didn't do enough.	You did so much.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.	I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.	File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.	Would it do any good?	No.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?	He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.	There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
He's stealing from you, Oskar.	Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
We know that, son.	The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.	We're aware of that.
I can do it, Captain.	Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
How's the name search going?	37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
Can't we hold him?	No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.	What now?
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.	That doesn't work, sir.
Have you checked the...	Attic, garage, basement, nothing.	Take the neighborhood.
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.	The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.	Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
He's broken his pattern.	They've broken their pattern.	You're sure about this two person thing?	Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
I would say we are now officially baffled.	On national television.
No, they broke up again. Bailey won't stop drinking and Sarah can't take it anymore.	thought he was doing AA.	No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.	I won't.	Don't. Think Bailey.	Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.	It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
Shit.	What is it?	I heard a noise.	Where?
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...	Stop it...	I can't believe you're alone in that house.
Outside.	That's smart.
Don't do that. Hang up...call...	What? I can't hear you...	Hang up...call...	I'm losing you.	...campus security...send someone...check out...place...	Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
Yes.	Who is this?	Cici. Who's this?	Someone who wants to talk to you.	Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.	That's okay.	Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.	Where is everybody?	We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.	Why aren't you there?	I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.	That's too bad.	"""Drink with your brain."" That's our motto. Who are you calling for?"	What if I said you?	What if I said goodbye?	Why would you wanna do that?	Why do you always answer a question with a question?	I'm inquisitive.	I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
Hello? Ted?	No, it's me.
WHAAAATT?	Don't forget to set the alarm.
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?	I live here.	I thought you were going to the mixer?	I had to change. Did anyone call?	Just some asshole trying to scare me.
Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.	I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
Cotton.	Can we talk?	I don't think that's a good idea.	Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.	What do you want from me, Cotton?	You could start with an apology.	I did that.	You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.	How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?	I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.	Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist.
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.	Did it?	It helped me realize one thing.	What?	You're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
Its perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. Im the victim.	Please, Cotton, dont do this.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.	Its over, Cotton.	Not until youre dead.
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?	Did you do it?
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?	You have a right to be angry.	No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.	Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.	You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.	Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.	Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?	Fair enough.	What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.	And much richer as a result.	Do I know you? You look familiar.	I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.	Good for you.
Hi, Gale, any leads?	Tons and tons.	Where is Sidney's father?	Home--where he lives.	And are the police sure about that?	Why don't you ask them?	Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?	No, I don't.	Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.	Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.	Youre all in this together?
Jesus, youre just as whacked as your son.	Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
What are you going to do?	Finish what my son started.	But youll never get away with it.	Enter Cotton Weary.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?	Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
My documentary is due on Tuesday.	What's your subject?	I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
I could use some therapy.	Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
I think he's doing Dolly.	"""And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."""	Definitely Whitney.
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?	Not one bit.	Where's Sid?	She dumped me.	No way.	Yeah.	You freakin?
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...	"I skipped. Too many ""That's her"" looks."	I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?	Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.	Sid, you don't have to.
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.	I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
About what?	The forbidden subject.
Lemme take you home.	I'll get my jacket.
This is exactly what I don't want.	I think it's out of your control.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.	Let us decide that.	What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?	It's under control.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?	No, it's not.	I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.	It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.	Then I'll make this easy for you. I like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid. But I'm gonna stay away. Until you say otherwise.
Go on, untie him.	No. This is a set up.	Thats quick.
Why?	Good question. You took the bait.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?	Youre not going to get away with this.
Yeah, were trying to send a message to Hollywood. Im really getting tired of all the happy endings. Its just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.	But nobody wants to see that. Itll never go. Theyll rewrite you. You dont want that.
Two.	So you'll relieve me at 2:30...	And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
Where's Sid?	Damned if I know. She ditched me.	You weren't supposed to leave her alone.	I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
She's got guards with her.	What guy?	Randy somebody.
He seemed harmless.	Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
Need some help, honey.	I got it..
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.	Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.	I really dont like that comparison, honey.	He hates Oliver Stone.	I find his work overwrought.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.	I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...	We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.	Youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. Its a whole world, Sid. Youre really popular amongst the demented.	Youre the one who got away.	Until now.
Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? Wheres the glamour in that?	The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.	A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.	Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.	And now, drum roll please...	Hope youre ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
A twist ending if you will.	Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu things been done.	..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...	And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth.	So we found a compromise.	Or it found us.	We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.	Just for you, Sid.	Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip.
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. Its been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?	Tails.
We had to have financing.	Tuitions expensive.
Hello, Dwight.	Miss Weathers.	I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...	I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.	I see you read the book.	Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.	And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.	"Page 32. ""Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence."" I think you've explained yourself."	Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.	No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
You have every right to be upset.	"Page 41. ""Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."""	I never meant to imply...	How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.	No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?	Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.	You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.	I think you're all an act.	And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.	I know that.	Yeah?	I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
Not good. How you doin?	Not good.
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?	Meaning?	He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?	Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.	Billy had alibis too.
You broke my heart.	What are we looking for?	A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?	Can we turn the light on?	That's not the way it's done.
And it's sexier in the dark.	Dewey, you and I would never make it.	Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...	..and as lonely as I am...	We'd break some furniture.
They're roomates.	And Joel's pre-med.	The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.	Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.	Hallie?
Ssshh! What was that?	Let's find out.
This is all too familiar.	Over here.
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.	C'mon. Let's go.
Jesus Christ!	He filmed his victims.
Let's go.	No, wait here.
Dewey?	There's nothing. I'm coming down.
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?	They thought it was a publicity stunt.	Oh my God. How could it happen?	They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.	It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie.
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.	Yeah, right.	Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.	No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.	Don't worry...	Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...	Just in case...	No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.	Dewey, there's no such place.	Humor me, Sid.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.	Whatever.
Who is this?	I'll give you one guess.
Who are you?	That's not the way we play the game.	I don't play games.	What if your life depended on it?
What do you want?	You're pretty when you're angry.
Where are you?	I'm everywhere.
Oh--a God complex	Stay away from the cop.
What do you want from me?	It's what you want from me.
What do you mean?	You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.	You're getting obvious.	No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.	No, wait...	Watch your back.
Sidney. Hello. How are you?	I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...	I'm sorry.	Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.	It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?	It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.	It's good to see you involved.	My morn was a Delta.
Sid, I'll come with you.	But who would operate your camera?
What?	Oh my God.
Someones trying to kill me. I need the police.	Are you in danger now?	Yes, goddammit!	Where is your attacker?	I dont know.	Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.	The safety what? Fuck that!
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.	I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
I have rehearsal.	I have to watch rehearsal.
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.	Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.	Too bad.
He tried to kill her first.	Is Sid in therapy?
I got a surprise for you.	What?
"""If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way..."	Don't do this.	"""And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will always love you."""
You're going to get it. You know what happens.	But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
Knock yourself out.	Hello?  Hello?
Time to change numbers again?	Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?	Please, I have the perfect excuse.	What about rehearsal?	Gotta.	I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
That was good.	Yeah, right.
Who is that guy?	It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.	No, girletta, I don't leave your side.	I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
We're missing the Sig Ep party.	No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.	No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.	I'd really just like to be alone.
Can I come with her?	No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.	It's not a good idea, Hallie.
Oh, Sid, youre sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.	You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING, flying through the room.	"The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to the screen. ""You dumb bitch. Get out of the house."" etc."
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...	Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her popcorn.
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...	Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.	"Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS ""Sit down."" Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised."	The young girl is slashed again.	The knife slices into Maureen again...then again. The theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A horrifying, sickening sight.
How many guys they have on you?	I counted four.
I've been waiting for you, baby.	Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.	Her old boyfriend?	No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy was a friend. MICKEY Watch out, Derek.
And white.	Easy black boy.	It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?	This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry?
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?	You're not allowed to ask that.	I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.	Thanks, Joel.
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.	Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.	But...
..this week's TKE kegger...	Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.	We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...	..we only promote safe rubbered sex.	..it's really about family and tradition...	..harmonica style is okay.	I just love being a sister.
Hello?	Gale?	She's not here right now.	But she's standing right next to you.
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?	What's your favorite scary movie?	SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?	Closer than you think.
Do you want to die?	"Gee, let me think. ""Do you want to..."" Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add."
I hate scary movies.	It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.	If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.	We got free tickets.
Take it off.	But...	Now.
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?	Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..	Shush.	I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
You ass.	I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.	You are so not funny.
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?	I get scared really easy, okay.	You gotta go with it. Scary movies are great foreplay.
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.	We can still Sandra Bullock it.	Sandra started without us. We can stay. He kisses her again, then breaks away.
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.	Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.	What are you talking about?	He's after me.
I'll be right back.	Where you going?
What was that?	Don't panic.
What do you want?	I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.	Do you work for her now?	Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.	Me, too. Randy. Me too.
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.	I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.	I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?	I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.	I gotta coupla of those buttons myself.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.	Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.	Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.	Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.	And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.	Melinda McGraw?	No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.	Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.	All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.	Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.	I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.	Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
Jesus.  Hello?	Hello.	Who is this?	Who is this?
Well what number are you trying to reach?	I don't know.	I think you got the wrong number, buddy.	Do I?	Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.	Wait, wait. Don't hang up.	Asshole, Can't talk.	But your voice sounds so familiar.
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.	Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.	Really? You're such a talented actor.	Thanks.	Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
What do you mean?	I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?	More of a game really.	What kind of a game?	You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.	I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!	Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!	Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.	What?! But I did everything you said to do!	That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.	What?!	Good bye Ben.
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?	I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!	No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
Yeah.	Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.
Where are you?	Closer than you think.	Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?	To see your reaction.	Reaction to what?
Can I help you?	I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?	Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?	Nope.	Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?	Well if you won't work for me, will you work for the president?
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --	It may be Maureen Reynolds --	Well you'll find neither. Rina Reynolds, however, You will.
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?	Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.	I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?	Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.	Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.	So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?	I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.	A note?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.	There's more.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.	I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.	And who would that be?
Alright Kincaid, no where to?	I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.	Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.	Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.	Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?	Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.
Who?	I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.	But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.	In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.	Please, call me Gale.	Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.	But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!	Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something
Four? There are five.	Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.	Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
Boys, boys, why don't we compare our gun calibers later?  The issue is Maureen Prescott!	Wrong, this issue is Sidney Prescott!  And either Mr. Riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her.  So, where is she?
Jesus Gale what happened?	He killed Milton! The killer's  inside there! Oh God!  DEWEY! Dewey's in there too! He needs medical help! He's hurt!	Alright, calm down. I'm going to radio in for backup right now.
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.	Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
Are you sure?	Absolutely.
What do you know about trilogies?	You mean like, movie trilogies?	You seem to like movies, Detective.	Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.	I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.	All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.	Did you request this case?	No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.	Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.	To me Hollywood is about death.	Excuse me?	I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.	What do you mean?	I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.	Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.	Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.	Hmm.	What did you know about your mother?	I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.	Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.	How is that good news?	Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.	Oh yeah, how?	Catch him, or kill him.
"Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?"	Yeah. A real tragedy.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.	Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.	That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.	Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.	What does this have to do with Sid?	Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?	Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
Is that a threat, Detective?	When it's a threat, you'll know it.	Is that a threat?
Detective Kincaid?	What Rielly?	There's someone here who wants to help.
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.	The killer called her.	What?  When?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?	He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?	No.
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.	And what made you think it was Sidney?	Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe.
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.	Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.	What?	I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.	Follow me.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.	Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.	Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.	She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
I can see nothing's changed.	No.
Listen Dewey I have to go to the bathroom.	Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?	No I'll be ok. I've got my mace. My knife.  These two lethal weapons.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.	Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Yeah?	Help me Sid! The killer's got me!	Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!	Sid I can see you!	Where are you Dewey?	I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
Where's Gale?	They've got her!	Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.	Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.	DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.	He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.	What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.	Show him.
They found another note?	Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.	You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.	This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.	Do you really mean it this time Gale?	Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.	Why would the police come to you?	Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?	What about me?	You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.	So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?	It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!	What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!	It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.	You used to say that was our strength.	Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?	Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.	All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?	Off the record.	Always.	Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.	And?	The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.	Someone stole Sid's file?	I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.	I'm sorry, this is too good!	What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?	Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it?	I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.	And who is that?
Jennifer needs me.	Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?	I'm on duty.
Stop following me.	I happen to work for the police god dammit!	You're not a detective.	Neither are you, Magnum P.I.	Gale, your engine's still running.	Fuck!
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.	Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
OH. OH GOD. GALE --	What?	GALE BEHIND YOU!
Thank you.	Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!	Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.	Has anyone else every used your phone?	Just Jennifer.  And you.
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.	Do you want us to come with you?	I work better alone.  Why don't you do some snooping around the set?
Sidney, what happened?	Nevermind, what'd you two find?
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.	Who is it?
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.	Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.	Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
What's your point?	No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.	I remember her!  She was a bit player in a couple of my movies. A nobody! So what does it matter?
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.	But you know who she was.	"When we did the first 'Stab"" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?"
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.	It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.	Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.	"Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?"	Honestly, my life.
Your life?	Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
Would you excuse me for a moment?	Sure.
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!	Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?	God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!	Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?	I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.	Still that was a much better movie, I saw it at the premiere last week. God, what the hell am I getting sidetracked with this shit for?! We've gotta get down to business.
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?	I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
Who's phone?	Oh shit it's my cell!
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?	What's your favorite scary movie Gale?	I dunno but I can tell you that your's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass! Now come out and fight like a real man you pussy!
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!	No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
Geez.	What the hell are you doing?	Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?	I am Gale Weathers!	Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?	None.	You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.	And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.	That's funny.
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.	Need to get in that building?	No really?	There a story in that building?	Possibly.	Gale Weathers would find a way.
Basements creep me out.	Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.	Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.	Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.	Bitch.
Nobody said she was an actor.	Good twist.
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!	Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.	Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.	Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?	Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.	GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.	Oh come on! Why the hostility?	Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.	They're the ones who approved it.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?	Who?
And now? I mean, murders on your set and still you say nothing?	Get real, that would make me a suspect!	Just because you knew her?	Yeah.	I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?	Now you listen to me, Lois Lane, let it go. It's dead and buried. Daddy took ol' Yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago.	Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.	It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were. It was for girls like her to meet men, men who could get them parts, if they made the right impression.  Nothing happened to her that she didn't invite, in one way or another, no matter what she said afterwards.	Are you saying she was-	I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.	Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.	Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.	Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.	Really, cause that stunt lost me the lead role in Roman Polanski's latest picture. Huh, what a coincide I was picked up by Roman Bridger. Well, not exactly the Roman I wanted. Get my point? STAB 3 is bullshit. Fuck, because of your big mouth I'm here, drinking piss water SCOTCH with Second rate fucking celebrities like Jennifer Jollie and yourself!  Hey, I just got an idea. Maybe I should Have a look at your break line. That your car over there?
I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.	You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.	Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
What'd he say?	"Oh, you know, the usual small talk, ""What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"""
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?	Who's this.
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.	What are you talking about?
Gale he's got Dewey!	I know! He killed Kincaid!	I know!	Let's get out of here!	GALE WATCHOUT!
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.	All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!	I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.	Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!	Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.	I can't take it anymore. This Hollywood exploitation of the nightmare I lived has to be stopped. I did this to make you all repent for your sins, and now I'm pleased I've got my message across. Good-bye.
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!	Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.	Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.	Oh it's no problem, I'm just... looking at your   music video awards.
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.	What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!	You're not happy with your part.	I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.	Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.	Huh, fine.	Page 22, Candy's big moment.	Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?	Hello.	Who's this?	Who's this?	This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?	Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?	Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.	But you know my favorite name?	I'm hanging up right now.	It's Sarah.	Roman that's not the line.	It is in my script.	Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?	It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.	What?  What movie?	My movie.
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.	And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.	"SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. ""What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident""."	Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.	I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.	Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?	No.	Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?	W-what do you want?	I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.	You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!	Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.	No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.	Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.	The final act? Well let's play asshole!	No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!	Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.	Who is this?	The question isn't who I am.  The question is, who's with me.
Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?	Yes.	Go there.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.	How do I know their voices are --	Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
You're dead!	I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
Where?	She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.	WHERE?	I'll call you, when you're on your way.
Yeah?	You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
Alright, I'm here. Now what?	You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.	I thought you wanted me here?
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.	It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
Hello?	Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.	Laura I think I just killed somebody.	Are you sure?	Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!	Well then the people you need to call are the police.	No I need to call you. Just you.	I'm sorry, your voice.	Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?	Who the fuck is this?	It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT!
What? She asked.	It's called tact, you fuckrag.	Sorry.
I didn't kill anybody.	No one's saying you did.
Owwww...	You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.	Sorry.
How'd you do?	Piece of cake. She'll be there.	Thanks, butt wart. You did good.	So you gonna try and make up with Sid?	Duh... that's quick.	I was just asking. Why are you always at me?	Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.	Oh...
You ready to party hard tonight?	You know it.
Dude. What are you doing here?	I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.	Oh yeah.
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.	It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.	And if you get it right -- you die.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.	Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
Nope.	And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.	That's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. You gotta die -- those are the rules.
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?	You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
Ready?	Yeah...
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...	Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...	And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.	Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.	Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
It's on the table.	No, it's not.
I thought she was dead.	She looked dead. Still does.
She can't get both of us.	Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.	Where the fuck did she go?
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!	I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?	I just wanted to see her, that's all.	You rode your bike out there?	Yes, sir.	And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too?
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?	No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.	We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here.
Billy? What the...	I'm sorry. Don't hate me.	What are you doing here?	You sleep in THAT?
My dad's in the other room.	I'll only stay a sec.
Close call.	What are you doing here?
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.	Now that it's out of your system.	And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.	Oh it did?	"Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid ""R"" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television."	So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.	No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
You know what my dad will do to you?	I'm going... I'm going.
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?	What's that?
Oh Billy... Please... God...	I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay...	He's here. He's trying to kill me...
Jesus, SHIT!	Hey, hey, it's just me.
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.	The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.	I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.	See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?	I'm so sorry... please understand.	Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.	You know that's not true.	Then what is it? Is there somebody else?	No...	Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?	No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.	It's been a year since she died.	Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.	When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.	Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.	You have to move on, Sid.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.	It's okay. We need to talk.
So...	So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.	No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.	You lost your mom...	But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...	Oh Sidney...	Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.	Sure it does. It's like Jodie Foster in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father.	But this is life. This isn't a movie.	Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
I wanna let go. I do...	Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
Sshh... it's okay.	Or even a good porno.	What?
You heard me.	Are you serious?	Yeah... I think so.
Who did you call?	What?	When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?	I called my dad.	No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.	Yeah... and when I called no one answered.	Uh-huh.	You don't still think it was me?	No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
I thought you were...	I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
NO! Don't believe him.	It's okay. Give me the gun.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!	Fuck you.	We already played that game. You lost, remember?
Why did you kill my mother?	Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
I don't understand...	We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.	Stop it!	Got the ending figured out yet? Time's running out.
Hello?	Are you alone in the house?
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?	Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS?
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.	Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
Yes.	Who is this?	Who are you trying to reach?	What number is this?	What number are you trying to reach?	I don't know.	I think you have the wrong number.	Do I?	It happens. Take it easy.
Hello.	I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.	So why did you dial it again?	To apologize.	You're forgiven. Bye now.	Wait, wait, don't hang up.
What?	I want to talk to you for a second.	They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya.
Hello.	Why don't you want to talk to me?	Who is this?	You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.	I don't think so.	What's that noise?
Popcorn.	You're making popcorn?	Uh-huh.	I only eat popcorn at the movies.	I'm getting ready to watch a video.	Really? What?	Just some scary movie.	Do you like scary movies?	Uh-huh.	What's your favorite scary movie?
I don't know.	You have to have a favorite.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?	Guess.	Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.	Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?	Yeah... Freddy Krueger.	Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.	The first one was, but the rest sucked.	So, you gotta boyfriend?	Why? You wanna ask me out?	Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?	No.	You never told me your name.
Why do you want to know my name?	Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
What did you say?	I want to now who I'm talking to.	That's not what you said.	What do you think I said?
I have to go now.	Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.	Nah, I don't think so...	Don't hang up on me.	Gotta go.	Don't...
Yes?	I told you not to hang up on me.	What do you want?	To talk.	Dial someone else, okay?	You getting scared?	No-bored.
Listen, asshole...	NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
Is this some kind of a joke?	More of a game, really.
I'm two seconds from calling the police.	They'd never make it in time.
What do you want?	TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.	Or else what?
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...	I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.	Sure...	I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you.	I'm getting scared.	I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...	I believe you...	So you better leave.	His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
How do you know his name?	Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
Where are you?	Guess.
Please don't hurt him.	That all depends on you.	Why are you doing this?
I wanna play a game.	No...	Then he dies. Right now.	NOOO!	Which is it?
What kind of game?	Turn off the light.
Please don't do this...	Come on. It'll be fun.	No... please.	It's an easy category. Movie trivia.	...please...	I'll even give you a warm up question.	Don't do this. I can't...	Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.	No...	Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
I don't know...	Come on, yes you do.	Please..stop...
What's his name?	I can't think.
Michael... Michael Myers.	YES!
Now for the real question.	NOOOO....	But you're doing so well.	Please go away! Leave us alone!	Then answer the question. Same category.
...please... no...	Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.	No it's not. It was Jason.	Afraid not.	It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.	Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
You tricked me...	Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
...leave me alone... please...	Answer the question and I will.
What door am I at?	What?	There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live.
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.	Your call.
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.	I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?	Productive. So they're closing down the school?	Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
And why is that? Has something happened?	You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.	I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.	Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer.	Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.	Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.	We're tracking the cellular phone bill.	Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?	No, not yet.	He's not a suspect, is he?	We haven't ruled out that possibil...
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.	Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.	That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.	You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
Evening, ma'am.	Deputy... good evening.	What brings you out to these parts?	You never know when or where a story will break.	Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.	Then what are you doing here?	Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.	Mind if I join you?
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.	What kind of lead?	A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.	I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?	Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.	Can I bring Kenny?	NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.
So is Dewey your real name?	Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.	I like it. It's... sexy.	Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.	What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism.	I don't think you're so bad.
Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car.	Sidney's father?	We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
I'll call for backup.	I'll get my camera.
What are you doing here?	Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.	You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
Does mom know?	Yes, you doofus.
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?	Hold up a sec...
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.	I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.	Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.	Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.	Shit.
What is she doing here?	She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?	...yeah...
Did you reach my Dad?	You're sure it was the Hilton?	At the airport.	He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?	I don't know. I guess.	We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
Any word on my Dad?	Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.	Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.	I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.	And my Dad? Any word on him?
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.	Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.	Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
You girls ready.	Yeah.	Looks like I'm your personal bodyguard tonight, Sid.
Have they found my father?	Afraid not.	Should I be worried?	Not yet.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.	How is everything?
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.	Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...	He's her boyfriend.
I was first to respond.	What were you doing out here?	Drive by patrol.	How is she?	She's tough.	Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.	What about the cellular phone bill?	They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?	Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
She staying with you?	We haven't located her Dad yet.
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.	Yes, sir, sheriff.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?	Keeping my eye on Sidney.	Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.	Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?	There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.	Have you contacted the bureau?	They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.	You think he could still be in town?	He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?	She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?	Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.	She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.	Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.	Yes, sir.
That fish smelled strong.	I told you to send it back.
Jesus...	What is it? Where's Casey?	Casey? Casey?
Where is she?	Call the police.
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.	The phone's dead.
Where is she?	I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
Casey! Casey!	Not my daughter... not my...
What? What?	Jesus! The camera-hurry!
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.	You want to go live?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.	When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.	If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.	But it's so much easier when we make it up.	Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty.
What's the plan?	Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.	What's the delay?	About thirty seconds.	As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?	Yes, that's right.
How's the book?	It'll be out later this year.
I'll look for it.	I'll send you a copy.
I'm not here to fight.	Just stay back.	I want to talk to you.	Kenny. Camera. Now.
Off the record. No cameras.	Forget it.
Please. You owe me.	I owe you shit.
You owe my mother.	Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.	And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.	What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.	Do you still think he's innocent?
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.	During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.	I think you falsely identified him. Yes.	Have you talked to Cotton?	Many times.	Has his story changed?	Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.	He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.	He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...	I saw him leaving wearing it.	But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother?
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.	Why would she lie about it?	For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?	And why would she do that?	Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.	Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
You're evil.	Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.	And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
Where do you get this shit?	Ricki Lake.
I have no idea.	Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.	Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.	Do you like scary movies, Sidney?	I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.	What's your favorite scary movie?	Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.	And why is that?	Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous.
Are you alone in the house?	That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.	Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.	So who are you?	The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?	So where are you?	Your front porch.
Why would you call me from my front porch?	That's the original part.
So where are you?	Right here.
Can you see me right now?	Uh-huh.	What am I doing?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.	If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Hello?	Hello Sidney.
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.	LEAVEMEALONE!	Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.	Who are you?
Are you okay?	Can you knock?	I heard screaming.	No you didn't.	No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...	...out at the airport...	...so call if you need me.	Got it.
Have a good trip.	Sleep tight, sweetie.
Stu was with me last night.	Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.	Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?	Working, thank you.	I thought Blockbuster fired you.	Twice.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?	She's the Scream Queen.
Stop. Right there.	Don't shoot. It's me.	Don't come any closer.	Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.	You got it.
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.	Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
For about two seconds.	Before she dumped him for Steve.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?	What are you saying? That I killed her or something?	It would certainly improve your high school Q.
"Besides --  ""Takes a man to do something like that."""	I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.	Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
Jesus, this place is packed.	We had a run in the mass murder section.	You coming tonight?	Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.	What?
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?	It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.	You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.	The why'd the police let him go?	Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?	There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.	So what's his reason?	Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.	She's saving herself for you.	Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?	I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?	Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...	Which is you...	So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.	And what would be your motive?	It's 1995 -- motives are incidental.
I thought everything was checked out.	I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.	I can cry on cue.
What's Leatherface doing here?	He came to make up.	There goes my chance with Sid.	Like you had one.
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?	Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
"There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say ""I'll be right back."""	Wanna another beer?	Yeah.	I'll be right back.
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.	Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.	No, Sid.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.	Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Why are they doing this?	Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.	Are you serious?	My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.	Yeah, okay... whatever.	Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.	You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.	Why are you doing this?	It's all part of the game.
You're crazy -- both of you.	"The official term is ""psychotic""."	You'll never get away with this.
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?	Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
Do you believe this shit?	What happened?
Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night.	No way.	And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.	Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.	Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.	Do they know who did it?	Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...	They think it's school-related?	They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than...  Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big.
Or a man's mentality.	How do you gut someone?
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.	No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.	Tell your mom I said thanks.	Yeah, yeah... are you okay?	Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.	I'll be there by seven. I promise	Thanks, Tatum.	Later.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.	It's past seven.	Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.	I'm not worried.	Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.	Whatever. Just hurry.	Bye.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.	Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Just another sleepover at the Riley's.	Just like old times, ain't it?	No, nothing's like it used to be.
Do you really think Billy did it?	He was there, Tatum.	I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw.
Take a message.	It's alright. I'll get it.
Come on, Sid.	Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.	But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.	I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
Shit, what is he doing here?	I bet he's pissed.	Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.	It was him, Tatum. I know it.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?	I don't know...	Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.	So you think my mom was a slut too?	I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.	If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?	You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.	Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.	It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.	And you believe it?	Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.	Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.	You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.	Come on, let's rock.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?	Oh, god...
Is Billy going to be there tonight?	He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.	You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.	But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?	Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
What do you think about when you're having sex?	With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
Who?	"Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing ""Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..."" He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman."	How does that get you in the mood with Stu?	"During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. ""Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..."" It's a real turn on."	No way.	"Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, ""Eight is enough..."""
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?	Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.	TATUM!	Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.	Deal.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?	I don't know, they just did.
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.	That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
I thought you dumped her for me.	I did. He's full of shit.
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.	Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?	For once, Stu, drop it.	Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
That's mature.	Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.	Tits -- see.
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.	What am I? The beer wench?	Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.	Give it to me.	How's that?	"There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, ""goodbye.""  Give it to me."
That's not necessary.  You're in.	Thank you.	Go start picking up the pieces.  We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.	What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.	So far it's all dead ends.  No credit history.  No employment history.  His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash.  We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane.  We may never know how he got that way.
You don't.  It goes to court now.	He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
He's pissing in our faces again and we're just taking it.	You're wound too tight, Mills.  Let it go.
How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?	Ease back, Mills.
What do you think?	I'm in.
"""Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light."" It's the murderer's way of announcing himself."	Announcing what?	There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...	So what?  This victim...	... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.	Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.	One is gluttony.
"What's this: ""I'm declining this case?""  It don't work that way."	This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.	I know what you're thinking, okay?  You don't want to get in bed with this every night, but it's different now.  You're retiring.  In six days you're all the way gone.
You've left unfinished business before.	Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
Have you heard?	No, I haven't heard.	There was a second.
Already.	Greed.  It was written in blood.
It's none of my business anymore.	I thought you might want to be filled in.	I'm sure everyone's doing their best.	Yeah.	Good.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?	I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.	Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.	What are you talking about?	You know.
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.	I heard.	I have no understanding of this place anymore.	It's always been like this.	Really?
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.	He's not finished.
How you feeling?	I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.	We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.	Yeah, that's true.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.	It would be too hard.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.	I read about it in the paper.
I guess... decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.	I'll see you.
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.	Where was the girl?	What?  What?	Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.	Who tied her down?  You or him?	He had a gun.  He had a gun... and he made it happen.  He made me do it!  He made me put that... that thing on.  Oh, Christ!  He made me wear it... and... and he told me to fuck her.  He had the gun in my mouth.
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!	Turn around.  Hands on your head!	What the hell's going on?	Who are you?  What are you doing out here?	I'm... I'm just delivering a package.
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.	Put it down.  Put it on the ground.	Okay...
I don't believe it.	Hello.
What do you mean?	I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?	It doesn't matter who I am.  Who I am means absolutely nothing.  You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.
What's so exciting?	It's not too far away now.
What time is it?	Why?
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.	David... please...	I visited your home this morning, after you left.
Give me the gun.	Her pretty head.
You didn't know.	NO!
Where we headed?	You'll see.
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.	Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.	What makes you so special that people should pay attention?	Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.	I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.	You know that's not true.	In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...	Spit it out.	It's going to be flawless.  People will barely be able to comprehend it.  It will seem almost surreal... but it will have a tangible reality, so they won't be able to deny it.
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.	Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.	Oh, don't worry. You won't...
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?	Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.	You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.	You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.	Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.	Murderers?	A woman...	Murderers like you?	A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.	Delusions of grandeur.	You should be thanking me.	And, why is that?	You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.	We would have gotten you eventually.	Really?  Just biding your time, then? Toying with me.  Is that it?  Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in?
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.	I seem to remember knocking on your door.	And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.	Sit back.
Just keep leading the way.	It's close.
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.	What the fuck is going on here?!
You've made a good life for yourself...	Shut up!
Here he comes.	What the fuck is going on?	I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.
Somerset...	Because I envy your normal life.  Envy is my sin.
I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.	Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...	Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p.  Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing.
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.	I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?	I... I don't follow.	All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.	I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess.  Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here before... before you decided to... quit.
You just met me.	Maybe I'm not understanding the question.	It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.	Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.	Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.	I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.	Not here.	I realize that.	Well, over the next seven days, do me the favor of remembering it.
I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?	And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.	Drop it.	For now.
Who said this was murder?	No one yet.	Then, why are we wasting our time?  This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham.  If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...	Please be quiet for a while, would you?
There's a bucket here.	What?	There's a bucket.  Under the table.
It's a bucket of vomit.	Is there any blood in it?	I don't know.  Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
You think it was poison?	Guessing at this point is useless.
You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?	No.	Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.	Good.	"The badge in my pocket says ""detective,"" same as yours."	I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.	Yeah, well, all I want is...  Just, just don't be jerking me off.  That's all I ask.  Don't jerk me off.
Is that clear?	Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...	I just don't think we should have that sort of relationship.  We'd start quarreling over insignificant things.
Same color and texture.	Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?
This doesn't make any sense.	You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
It could be nothing.	But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.	This was one sadistic motherfucker.
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.	This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.	Whoa, whoa... what?!
It's too soon for him.	Can we talk about this in private?
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.	Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
It's my wife.	What?
Well?	I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.	How's that?	Tonight.
I'd like you to meet Somerset.	Hello.
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.	What about sports?	What about them?
You go to movies at least?	I read.  Remember reading?	"I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen ""Green Acres."""
"You've never seen ""The Odd Couple?""  This is sick.  ""The Honeymooners?!"""	I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.	I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.	Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.	All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?	He cut along the side of his stomach.  The love handle.
He must have left another puzzle piece.	Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...	This is just to satisfy my curiosity.  I'm still leaving town Saturday.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.	And, if it's a threat.	We put her in a safe house.
He's preaching.	Punishing.	The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.	Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.	Did you read them?	Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...	Seven Terraces of Purgation.	Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.	For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.	Forced what?	Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.	Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
No fingerprints?	Nothing.	Totally unrelated victims.
No witnesses of any kind?	None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
This is the one thing.	I know.	What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?	Okay.  But, what?
You're sure your men didn't move this?	Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
Nothing.	It's got to be.
What the fuck is that?	A switchblade.
There must be something.	We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
What?	Bear with me.
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!	Just wait!
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?	No.
He just may be nuts enough.	It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.	Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.  You know... little voices tell them bad things.
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?  About catching this guy.  You really want to believe that, don't you?	And you don't?	I wish I still thought like you.	Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.	All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...	Oh, that's all.	We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.	Bullshit.	I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.	I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.	In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.
Does this make it with you?	Doesn't seem like our man, does it?	You tell me.  I'm new in town.	He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.	The fingerprints.	Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.	We'll tag along.
Why would we?	Satisfy our curiosity?
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?	Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.	And?	It was my first one of these.  We were a secondary unit, and I was pretty shaky going in.  I was still considered a rookie.
How did the fire fight end?	I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
How was it?	I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.	I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.	Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
It is Victor.	Call an ambulance.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.	I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.	Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.	No kidding!  No fucking kidding!	We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.	I don't know about you, but I feed off my emotions.	He'll string us along all the way if we're not careful.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?	They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.	Sorry about that... I just...	Oh, it's alright.
"Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, ""I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had."	A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.	Who pays the rent on time.
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.	This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.	There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.	It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.	Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.	It's a fine line between insane and inspired.	Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...	No.	Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.	No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.	We don't know for sure...	Yes we do.  Here...
"This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  ""Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... """	And so what?	Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?	Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.	Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.	What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
How much money do you have?	I don't know... like fifty.
Well, that was money well spent.	Let's go.
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.	It's be best if you got to the point, cause I'm about ready to punch you in the face.
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.	Him?	For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.	What?  Assessing fines?	They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.	You got to be kidding.	Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.	How is this legal?	Legal... illegal.  These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.
So they ran our list.	If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.	Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.	Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.	How do you know all about this?	I don't.  Neither do you.
This is a waste of time.	We're focusing.	I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.	The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?	It's not what you think it is.	The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.	That is.	The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...	Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?	That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.	This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.	We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.	Sure.  Uh, excuse me... are you by any chance a serial killer?  Oh, you are? Well, come with us then, if it's okay.
What are you going to say?	You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.	Who told you about my silver tongue?  You been talking to my wife?
Are you alright?	I'm fine.	What happened?
Wait... just wait.	It was him.	You can't go in there.
The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.	We need a warrant.	We have probable cause now.
Think about it...	What the fuck is wrong with you?	Think about how we got here!
By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.	Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.	Okay... okay... get off.
You stupid son of a...	No point in arguing anymore...
What are you talking about?	We had him.
We could use about fifty more men here.	I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.	Then, he must write about these murders.	"""What sick, ridiculous, puppets we are, and what a gross, little stage we dance on. What fun we have, dancing and fucking, not a care in the world.  Not knowing that we are nothing.  We are not what was intended."""
No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.	Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
He's preaching.	These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.	Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.	"One birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book, ""The Century of the Detective,"" by Jurgen Thorwald.  It traced the history of deduction as a science, and it sealed my fate, because it was real, not fiction.  And, that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime... it was incredible to me."
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.	If we get him, I'll be happy enough.	No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.	How can you say that?  Especially after today?	Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.	You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.	You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?	You do your job...	Where's the victory?	You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.	Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.	Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.	People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.	What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?	It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.	Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.	Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.	You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...	No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.	"Listen to yourself.  You say, ""the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people.""  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters."	That part of me is dead.
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.	Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.
Oh, you want to stay now?	One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.	You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?	I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
You knew I'd say yes.	No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.	Big surprise.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.	When do we get to question him?
You know he's fucking us.	You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.	Well... what the fuck, man?	He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
No.	I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.	I will.
What is it?	Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.	Slut.	Kiss me on the lips.	Give me a break.
Stay with him.	Wait!	There's no time to discuss it!
Throw your gun down now!	What are you talking about?  What happened?
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!	What did you say?
Tell me it's not true.	I can't let you do this...
Put your gun down!!	Don't do this... please...	Put the gun down, Somerset!
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.	I... I don't understand.
I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully.  Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.  Anything at all.	I don't know why... why now?	Please, I need you to help me if we're going to get who did this.
Anything... anything missing or different.	I don't see anything.	Are you absolutely certain?	I can't do this now... please.
This painting...	What?	Why is this painting hanging upside-down?
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.	Oh... um, William.	It's a nice name.  William, I'd like you to meet David.  David... William.
It smells good.	What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.	High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.	Really?
Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.	No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.	I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.	It surprises me.  It really does.	Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. Just ask your husband.
How long have you lived here?	Too long.  What do you think so far?
I don't know, with this case.	If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now... goodnight.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.	It's a hard place.	I don't sleep very well.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.	I'm sorry, I only...
Perfect example.	You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.	I don't know why I asked you to come.	Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.	I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.	He mentioned it.
I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.	You should look into private schools.	I don't know...
Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.	I hate this city.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.	I want to have children.  It's just...	I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.	Did the wife confess?	When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.	Crime of passion.	Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.	This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
Did their son see it happen?	I don't know.
How's California?	How should I know?	But Mose Harper said...	That old goat still creakin' around?...Whyn't someone bury him?
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...	It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?	They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
You askin' me to clear out now?	You're my brother...You're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to...Ain't that so, Martha?
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...	Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
Lucy's going on seventeen now...	An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!	That's enough...Go on inside and help Lucy set the table...You, too, Deborah!
Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.	It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...	What, Ben?	I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?	Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
Let's get along...	Why don't you finish the job?
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!	Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!	That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?	Huh...? No...no water.
What you saw wasn't Lucy.	It was, I tell you!	What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress...  I found Lucy back there in that canyon...I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...I thought it best to keep it from you -- long as I could.
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??	She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!	As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...	What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...	If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...	AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.	I ain't wearing no gun.
Another one, eh?	This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.	Well, that's seven we can score up to your brother, Ethan.
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?	No sir...pleasure.	In that case, give the boys room...
You all right, sergeant?	Dunno...Seems so.	Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...	Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...	Yes sir...
Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.	I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
You ain't goin'...	He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.	Well, swear him out again!...I'll go with you.
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.	Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?	I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.	Got a warrant?	You fit a lot of descriptions.	I figger a man's only good for one oath at a time...I took mine to the Confederate States of America...  So did you, Reverend...
He cometh forth like a...	Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!	...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
What good does that do?	By what you preach...none!
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.	You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
It's what we're here for, ain't it?	I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...	...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!	Yes, sir...But if you're wrong, <U>Captain</U> Clayton, don't ever give me another!
You got any more orders, Captain?	Just keep goin'...
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.	How far's the river from here, Mose?
I didn't give any order to fire!	That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...	You got one now!
Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?	Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!	Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.	This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?	<U>Captain</U>...Nope, wouldn't say that... Likely you had your reasons for killin' Futterman...Probably needed killin'...I'm speaking as a ranger now, not as a reverend...Fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that's raised some question -- that and a missin' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise.
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.	How many, would you say?	Enough to go around...I'd say about a dozen apiece...Mount 'em up!
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.	There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.	Now mount up, son...
I say NO!	Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
What in...?	Captain Clayton...Captain!
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??	Sir?	Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?	Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...	Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work.
If there's anything I can do, sir...	God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...	But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?	All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...	Yes, sir...
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?	I'm Clayton.
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...	Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?	Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.	Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?	My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.	JOINT action?	Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...
And what makes you think he's in this territory?	Yesterday, one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with Scar till only two days ago... He talks crazy but I brought him along...Says he lives here...keeps mentioning a rocking chair.
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...	But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...	Sonny, yonder's a passel of murderers, complete with Texican scalps an' white girl captive...You want to protect us, you just get out of our way...Now <U>skedaddle</U>!
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!	Grab hold!...
Unnt-meah!	We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...	They have done...nothing...They are my people...
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...	You lie! All white men lie...and kill...	Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?	I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...	I've come now...	These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
Ay-eh...They was here...	SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...	Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.	Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...	You were born old...
Well, the reward still stands...	Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...	You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...	Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?	Told ya, didn't I?	Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.	Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...	Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...	Scar! Where's he holed in?	Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
How'd you come by this?	You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.	That's what I said.	You got it with you?
Talk!	A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...	Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.	Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.	Keep talking.	Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.	And maybe you lie...	In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.	Ain't yours yet.
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...	<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?	I beg your pardon?	That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...	Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?	Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!	That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.	You've done a lot of growin'...
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...	Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.	Yes, sir.	Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
What you want me to call you?	Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?	Well, fust off...
Well, come on!	Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
Nothing for you to see.	Leggo...
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...	Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...	If they're still alive...
Easy on that!	Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...	They're with 'em -- if they're still alive.
You want us to fire a shot if...	No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
You all right, Ethan?	Huh...?  Sure I'm all right...
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?	Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
What you goin' to do?	Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
Say it. We're beat!	No...our turnin' back don't change anything...not in the long run. If she's alive, she's safe...for a while...They'll keep her to raise as one of their own, 'til she's of an age to...
And you think we got a chance to find her?	An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
Good night...Laurie...	Good night...
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...	YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...	I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...	Why?	Because she's my...my...	She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!	I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...	That don't make 'em kin...	All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.	How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em...You ain't even got money to buy cartridges...Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here...
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...	Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!	Good night.
Hey! What's the idea...?	Maybe I'm gettin' like Mose Harper -- my bones is cold tonight...
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...	What's that?
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...	Oh...	You all settled an' comfortable now?
Futterman?	He just couldn't wait...	Whatchu doin'?...
Let's go...I think I stumbled onto somethin'...	Scar?
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.	But I just bought a good blanket.	Forget it...
What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...	Think it might be...?
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!	What?	You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!	Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...	And have her whole family after our scalps for floutin' one o' their women?...No sir! Come on, Mrs. Pauley...
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...	Cut it out, will ya...
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...	Look?
You ask her!	Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...	She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.	Think she means for us to follow?	How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
I think maybe we oughta...	Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
Ethan, quit it!	Nine...  Ten!	What's the sense in it!
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.	Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....	Ain't that too bad...If you feel that sorry for your kinfolk, I'm surprised you didn't take up with that squaw wife of yours...
Well, you're a widower now...	What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
No...She's not...	I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
Lemme alone...	You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.	Never heard of him...	Cicatriz is Mex for <U>Scar</U>...an' he has a white girl in his tepee...Be seein' you...
Stay out here.	Not likely.
You figger Scar means to kill us?	He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.	Why didn't he make his move back there?	I don't know...Somethin' tied his hands...maybe hospitality...
How? She's even forgot her own language!	Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Go on! Get out of here while you can...	Over there!
They'll be back...	We won't be here...Come on!
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...	Not no more.	You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.	She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
What's that got to do with us?	What's goin' on?
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.	It's what I'm countin' on.
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...	Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...	She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...	You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
Was your niece about their age?	Not far from it...	Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...	They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...	There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?	Comancheros...	That's the breed...Course it might take time.	Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.	I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.	I got your boy killed.	Don't go blamin' yourself...
Why it's just a snip of calico...	You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?	Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?	No...not yet...
She's not a little girl any more.	You've seen her!...She's alive?	I've seen her...and she's alive.
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...	From the beginning...	'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...	Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.	Dear Miss Laury...I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Com- anches the late Mister Futterman told us about...
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?	That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!	A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
They never find that girl.	Yours truly...  And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just <U>Martie</U>!...  I don't care if he <U>never</U> comes back!
Don't go takin' that stuff...	Ain't worth the mendin'...
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?	Well I ain't one of 'em!	I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...	You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...	Wouldn't bother me...  I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you...
Might at least have left me my pants!	Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...	Finish your breakfast...	I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!	Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...	But that's Sweet-face -- your own good horse.
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!	I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...	One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...	It wasn't much of a letter...	No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...	But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...	It isn't fair...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...	You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
Martie...don't go! Not this time.	You crazy?	It's too late...She's a woman grown now...	I got to fetch her home...	Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...	<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!	Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!	Only if I'm dead!
She'd be about thirteen now...	We got two around that age...	Where?	You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...	But couldn't you...?	Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
Why else?	Come on, say it.  You know...
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?	"""With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."""
I have to cut his windpipe...	You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!	What else should I do, damn it, he's dying!
Ellen, move aside...	Oh God, Tommi...
Stop that!	You'll never get away from me!
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?	They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?	Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.	Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
What kind of a horrible thing is that?	It still worked in town.	I mean the armchair!	Oh, that was upstairs.  A real antiquity!  I think it's great.
Maybe the antenna's broken.	We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
Hey... the fuse.	Oh, damnit!
Do you know where fuse box is?	In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.	We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.	Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!	Do you have a better idea?	I'll do it myself.	You?	My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?	My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.	Yes, daddy.
Where are you going?	Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
What are you doing?	Making our very own solstice fire.
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?	I just had a really strange experience.
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.	Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?	We just have to make a new beginning.	Cherry-red Tears.	What?	Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.	Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.	I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.	"And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  ""With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."""
I miss Tommi so much.	So do I, believe me.	Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?	Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.	If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
Who was that?	Someone from the village.
Martin, it's not funny!	You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!	Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?	Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
So, did you sleep good?	Yeah... I have to go to town.
Hey, you're still here.  I suppose you like it here with us.	No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?	Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
Where have you been all day?	I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?	Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
Where have you been?	In the village.  Look what I found.
"""Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."""	Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?	What? What am I supposed to sense?	The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
Who's that?	I haven't the slightest idea.
What?	Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
She was old.	Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.	Maybe an animal.	An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?	Hi, darling.
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?	This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.	"Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  ""There is something negative about the place...""  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!"
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?	Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
Martin, what-	It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.	Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?	What are you talking about-
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.	We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.	'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
It's important - he knows the last chapter.	Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.	...So he's dictating you a new bestseller?  Whatever that is, it's not our son.
What?	I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think?
How did you get me out of there?	I wouldn't have made it by myself.
For God's sake, what happened to me?	You don't remember?
Ellen.	You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.	Thank you.
I really hate to bother him, but...	Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.	Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?	But what is the truth?	I don't know all about what happened back then.  But it always stood between me and my husband.
Hello.  Can I help you?	Does this dog here belong to you?
No, I've never seen him before.	You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
Ellen Straub.	It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?	Do I look like it that much?	Village gossip.  You're a real attraction here.
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.	Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.	1976.  What happened back then?
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.	I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!	There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
And that is?	A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
Mrs. Straub!	I've killed my husband!	What?	I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...	We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?	Just call me Elisabeth.
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.	Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
You didn't tell her!	We should leave the past alone.	Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...	Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?	Yes, something was...
Hammer?	How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
Well, look here!	"Ladies and gentlemen: The ""Straub country-residence""."
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?	Tenth floor.	Very funny.
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.	I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
Twenty-three, to be exact.	I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?	Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona	And the title of this piece?	Mercutio
WillWhere is Mercutio?	Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
You did not like the speech?	"The speech is excellent.  ""Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!"" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible."
NedI knowI know	It's good.	Oh	The title won't do.	Ah	Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.	Thank you, Ned.
You are a gentleman.	And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
Ohwhat have I done?	He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Follow that boat!	Right you are, governor!
I know your face. Are you an actor?	Yes.	Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.	Really?	I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.
Do you know that house?	Sir Robert De Lesseps.
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.	Writer, is he?
Thank you, my lady!	Lady?	Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high. Wouldn't deceive a child.
What do you want, Kit?	My Massacre at Paris is complete.	You have the last act?	You have the money?	Tomorrow.	Then tomorrow you will have the pages.	Wait!  Will you desist!	Twenty pounds on delivery	What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.	Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.	Never!	Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.	I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!	You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.	Treachery!
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.	The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.	And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?	Ask him.
We have no Juliet!	No Juliet?!
We will all be put in the clink.	See you in jail.
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?	I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.	Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?	When I have fifty pounds.
Are you writing?	A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.	What is the chief part?	Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.	The title?	Romeo	I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.	It's for Henslowe. He paid me.	How much?	Ten pounds.	You're a liar.
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.	Ned is wrong for it.
Here is two sovereigns--I'll give you two more when you show me the pages.	Done.
Words, words, wordsonce, I had the giftI could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstonesfor sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnerybut now	And yet you tell me you lie with women?
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and	Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.	I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.	I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.	Interesting.	Nothing comes.	Most interesting.	It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.	Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
How long has it been?	A goodly length in times past, but lately	No, no. You have a wife, children
A woman of property?	She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so	And your relations?	On my mother's side the Ardens	No, your marriage bed.	Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.	So now you are free to love	yet cannot love nor write it.
Will it restore my gift?	The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.	Who is that?
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.	Yes, I saw it.	Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.	By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.	That's me.	And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.
When?	Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.	Take his feet out. Where will you get
I have a wonderful new play!	Put his feet in.	It's a comedy.	Cut his nose off.	A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!	And his ears.	And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!	Partners!	It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken identities, a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
What's the title?	Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.	Good title.
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.	A share of the profits.	There's never any	Of course not!	Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's DaughterAlmost finished?	Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
This time we take your boots off!	What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?	The theatres are all closed by the plague!	Oh, that.	by order of the Master of the Revels!	Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.	So what do we do?	Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.	How?	I don't know. It's a mystery.
Where is the play?	Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Is it going well?	Very well.	But nothing is happening.	Yes, but very well.
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business	Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!	The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.	Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!	Nobody knew!
It is over.	I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor.  I am sorry, Will.
No Juliet?!	it will be all right, madam.	What happened to Sam?	Who are you?	Thomas Kent!
Do you know it?	Every word.
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?	Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move	No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?	It is all locked safe in here	God be praised!  Locked?	As soon as I have found my muse
Who is she this time?!	She is always Aphrodite.	Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?	Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?	Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -	What piece? Richard Crookback?	No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?	Who wrote that?	Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.	Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?	Fifty pounds? What for?	Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.	Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!	No, then.
Where are you going?	To my weekly confession.
Now where? Will?	To the Palace at Whitehall.
I feel a scene coming on.	Is it about a pirate's daughter?
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!	Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
Will! Have you finished?	Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?	I did not.	Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?	Tomorrow
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.	We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
Nobody. The author.	We are about to embark on a great voyage.	It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.	You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
Cut round him for now.	What? Who?	Romeo.	The one who came with your letter?	What?
Juliet? You mean Ethel.	God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
By God, I wish I knew.	By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
We are lost.	No, it will turn out well.	How will it?	I don't know, it's a mystery.
Another little problem.	What do we do now?	The show must  you know	Go on.	Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.	How will it?	I don't know. It's a mystery.
Kit	How goes it, Will?	Wonderful, wonderful.	Burbage says you have a play.	I have. And chinks to show for it.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.	I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.	Not new--my Doctor Faustus.	"I love your early work. ""Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"""	I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.	Good title.	And yours?	Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.	What is the story?	Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.	Romeo isItalian. Always in and out of love.	Yes, that's good. Until he meets	Ethel.	Do you think?	The daughter of his enemy.	The daughter of his enemy.	His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.	Mercutiogood name.
Good luck with yours, Kit.	I thought your play was for Burbage.	This is a different one.	A different one you haven't written?
"""Good morrow, cousin."""	"""Is the day so young?"""
"""But new struck nine."""	"""Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"""	"It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"""	"""Not having that which, having, makes them short."""

Two hours at prayer!	Lady Viola is pious, my lord.	Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!	It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.	It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
Not ready? Where is she?	Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.	Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
Be good to her, my lord!	I will.
God bless you!	Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.	I liked the dog, for laughs.	But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?	When the Queen commands it.	But at the playhouse. Nurse?	Be still.
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.	I am not so well-born.	Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.	All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.	Like Valentine and Silvia?	No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .	As a nurse.	But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.	Verona again.	A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
Your mother, and your father	From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?	He looks well enough for a mountebank.	Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.	My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.	You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Your Majesty.	Stand up straight, girl.
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.	Your Majesty.	What do you love so much?	Your Majesty	Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?	I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed	They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
And--?	And I love poetry above all.	Above Lord Wessex?
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.	Oh, but they can!
Your Majesty	There was a wager, I rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
Your Majesty!	Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so soon?	Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.	Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?	Fifty shillings.  Pounds.	Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.

When will you write me a sonnet, Will?	I have lost my gift.	You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.	Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?	Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.
Will!	I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?	I am, Master Shakespeare.	But your voice  Have they dropped?	No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.	Master Henslowe, you have your actors.
Master Shakespeare	Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam?	It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.	Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.	"""Parting is such sweet sorrow"""
"""Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"""	"""Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."""	"""Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what hands to: They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."""
"""Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."""	"""Then have my lips the sin that they have took."""	"""Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again."""
"""The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek."	"""Ay me."""	"""She speaks."
I would not for the world!	I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
"""O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"""	"""What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"""	"""The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."""
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.	My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?	She will breed. If she do not, send her back.	Is she obedient?	As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.	I like her.
Like you, I found him not at home!	So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.	You have opened the playhouses?	I have, Master Shakespeare.	But the plague	Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house.
Who are you, master?	I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.	I'll be damned if you are!
Better fortune, boy.	I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.	You admire it?
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.	Oh. What is your name?
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.	I have to get back.
My lady!	Who is there?	Will Shakespeare!
Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!	The same, alas.	"Oh but why ""alas?"""	A lowly player.	Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.	Oh--I am him too!
Oh my lady, my love!	If they find you here they will kill you.	You can bring them with a word.	Oh, not for the world!
Can you love a fool?	Can you love a player?
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.	Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?	I am.	Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
I do not know how to undress a man.	It is strange to me, too.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.	There is.	Even your play.	Oh	And that was only my first try.	Well perhaps better than my first.
You would not leave me?	I must. Look-- how pale the window.	Moonlight!	No, the morning rooster woke me.	It was the owl--come to bed
Oh, let Henslowe wait.	Mr. Henslowe?	Let him be damned for his pages!	Oh--no, no!	There is time. It is still dark.	It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!	It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
Oh, do not go	I must. I must
Oh, Will!	Yes, some of it is speakable.
"""Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"""	That's my line!	Oh, but it is mine too!
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.	Oh, but it will end well for love?	In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.	Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!	What will you have me do? Marry you instead?	To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.	You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.	Then I will go with you.	You cannot, Wessex will kill you	I know how to fight!	Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
Will! What--?	A literary feud. Quite normal.
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.	You never spoke so well of him.	He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.	You lie.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.	My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.	Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.	I was the more deceived.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.	Oh, my love  You ran from me before.	You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.	You cannot marry Wessex!	If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
Nono.	But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
Will you read it for me?	"""Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."""	"""It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."""
"""thou need'st not to be gone."""	"""I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."""
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.	I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.	It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.	I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.	If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.	A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?	An excellent beginning  Let him bea duke. And your heroine?	Sold in marriage and half way to America.	At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the dukeOrsino.	Orsinogood name	But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy	and thus unable to declare her love
But all ends well.	How does it?	I don't know. It's a mystery
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.	Nor you for me.	Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.	Write me well.
My lady Viola.	My lord.	I have spoken with your father.	So my lord? I speak with him every day.
My lady VIOLA.	Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.	I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.	You flatter, my lord.	No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.	Do you intend to marry, my lord?	Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.	I do not love you, my lord.	How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.	Virginia?!	Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .	But why me?	It was your eyes. No, your lips.
Will you defy your father and your Queen?	The Queen has consented?	She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.	I will do my duty, my lord.
Good morning, my lord!	Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
I meanYour Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can	Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.	It is not my riding day, my lord.	Bless me, I thought it was a horse.	I am going to church.	I understand of course. It is to be expected.	It is to be expected on a Sunday.	And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.	Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?	Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
He is dead?	Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
Your name?	Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.
Take off your hat.	My hat?	Where did you learn how to do that?	I . . .	Wait there.	Are you Mr. Shakespeare?	Let me see you. Take off your hat.
Yes, sir.	Do you understand me?	No, sir.	He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.	Of course you have not! I have not written it!
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?	If you love her, you must do what she asks.	And break her heart and mine?	It is only ours you can know.	She loves me, Thomas!	Does she say so?	No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?	I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.	Your aunt?	Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.	Like a sickness and its cure together.	Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?	Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself.
And her lips?	Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!	And her voice? Like lark song?	Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.	She sings too?	Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?	What of her bosom?	Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!	I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?	Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!	But what of Lord Wessex?	For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!	It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
"""Poet?"""	I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
How do I offend, my lord?	By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?	Christopher Marlowe at your service.
Here we come at last, my lord!	Are you bringing your laundry woman?	Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!	On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps	Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches!
Is there a man?	A man, my lord?	There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?	A theatre poet?	An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?	Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.	That dog!
You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!	You are on my ground.	By God, I'll fight the lot of you
What's his name?	I don't know -- Campbell or something?
All right, just a few questions.	I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?	Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?	With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.	Serve.	I was trying to educate you.	Just serve.	In the same fashion as chess.	What?	Chess. Chess is often used as well.	Will you shut up and play.	You're a bad loser.	I haven't lost yet.
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.	Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.	You learn that in your psychotherapy group?	Discussion group, Alex, discussion.
What do you think?	About what?	About this guy, this Hugo person.	I don't have time.	I'm only asking what you think.	I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
He made it clear.	Why, thank you, David.
Only on expenses.	It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.	Have you seen him?	Alex, I don't have the time --	Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --	No.
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.	Can I show you something?
No.	Think about it.	No.	Come on, David.	No.	Juliet?
You mean immoral.	I'm only asking you both to think about it.	It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.	But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.	You think so?	All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
He's still here.	He couldn't get his car started.	When are you going to let the police know?	You call them if you want.	And what about you?
Now what else? DAVID I don't know.	A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.	So who's going to do it?	Dig the pit, I don't know.	No, not that.	Then what? Who's going to do what?	You know what I'm talking about.	Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?	You know what. Who's going to do it.	We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?	I can't do it.	I don't hear this.	I won't be able to.	You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.	I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.	I just thought we should discuss it.	Take his legs.
I don't know.	Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
Finished.	But not quite.	Is that going to be deep enough?
Don't you worry about that.	Is this necessary?	Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
That was good.	Can we talk about something?	Not now. I have an idea.
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --	Just stop worrying.
What's the problem?	I want to talk now.	After you drink to love and happiness forever.	Now.	After.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?	Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.	You think so?
How much did you pay?	I don't know.	How much did you pay?	I don't know.	How much?	I don't know.
What is this?	Security.	From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?	There was a break-in.	Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six.
Doesn't it worry you?	No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
What's all this for, more security?	I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.	Oh, that'll come in useful.
What? Yes, that's fine.	You're sure? There's lots more.	No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.	What's wrong?	Nothing.	You're not eating.	Not eating what?	Not eating like you used to, that's what.	If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
I want to secure it.	Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
You looking for me?	Looking for you? Yes.	What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?	We just wanted to speak to you.
Who?	Your friends.	I don't know what you're talking about.
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.	It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.	I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.	I beg your pardon?
But they know.	They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --	They know.	They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.	Except the money.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.	Yeah, I was phoning your mother.	You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.	So I gathered.	Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.	It's all right. I'll forward your mail.	No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.	Oh, no, no, no. Don't let it worry you. Not at all. It's probably for the best.	For the best. Exactly. I wouldn't want things to end on a downer.	Not at all.	I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?	Yeah?	But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?
No, can't think of anything else that matters.	About the mail --	It's very kind of you to offer, but --	Where do you think you'll go?	Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
What?	I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.	Your idea? Well, that fits. I mean, the two of you, that fits together. I should have seen that long ago.
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.	I don't know anything about it.	Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.	Cover it?	Well?	But there's no --	Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.	I don't know.	Don't know what?	Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
Is this being recorded?	This is just an informal discussion.	Are you recording it?	What does it look like?	It looks like he's writing everything down.	That's because he is. Does that upset you?	No. Why should it?	Well, then?	I've never seen any of these men before.	Take another look at these two.	I don't know them.	And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?	Yes, I suppose so.
Well, is it?	What?	Parked outside?	No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
That's it, then.	That's all?	Sorry to waste your time.	Oh, no problems. Don't worry.	Just one thing.	Yes.
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.	I see.
Right.	Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
That's right.	What?
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?	Yes, thanks.	Good. Well, you've seen the flat?	Yes.	And you like it?	Oh, yes, it's great.	Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?	Yes.	Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.	Well, yes.	So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?
What?	Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
Cameron.	Cameron?	Yes.	Really?
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?	I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?	Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?	OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
Did you know --	Just serve.
I thought you stopped going.	Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.	Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.	For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.	For the flat.	No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.	She hated you --	Well, she had problems --	-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.	-- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.	He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
Who was it?	I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
So we'll meet him, then?	What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
Aroused and inflamed.	Alex.	He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.
I'm not usually drunk.	Not usually this drunk.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --	It was you, Juliet, it was you --	-- instead of what he is --	What I am.	-- which is --	-- which is a hack.	The man we know and love.	A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.	Know and love?	Yeah.	I think you're lying.	You're right.	You see, they don't really know me.	No, Alex, we don't really love you.
Have you seen Hugo?	No. Any idea which channel he's on?
David hasn't seen him either.	So I gathered.	Maybe he didn't like us.	David?	Hugo.	His car's still there.	He's got a car?	So what's wrong with that?	What sort of car?	Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.	I will ask you once more, what sort of car --	A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.	Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.	So?	Open it.	You want me to kick it open?	Yes.	Now?	Yes.	All right. No problem.
I wonder how he did it?	Did what?	I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
Alex.	What? What's wrong?	What are you doing?	I'm just looking.	Don't.	Don't look?	No.	Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?	No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?	It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.	Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.	Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
No, Alex. It's, it's --	What?	Unfeasible.	Is that all?
Who's going to do it?	I thought we all were.	I don't thinkI can.	But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.	I don't want to. It's different.	And now you tell me.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.	OK.	David?
Be careful.	Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?	Stop nagging.	I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
Sshh.	I want my money back. Excuse me.
Love and happiness for ever.	For ever and ever.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.	It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
Look over there. It's Cameron.	Who?	Cameron. You remember Cameron.	No, I don't.	What's he doing here?	That's not him.	Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!
Well, you certainly had a good look around.	You were magnificent.
Hello. Hello.	Who was it?	Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.	Are you all right?	No.	Then let's spend some money.
Will you calm down.	Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?	No, no, it's different.	I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.	It tastes different.	I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.	He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.	Be like a weight off your shoulders.	You know we're right.	Don't you?
I don't see the point in that.	Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
Leave him alone.	He can't stay up there.	He'll come down. Leave him alone.	Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?	No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?	Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
Boy, am I glad to see you.	What are you doing here?	We have to talk.	Your painful groin?
Later. But first -- him.	David?	Exactly. Now I've been thinking --	Oh, good.	He won't do anything for me, but for you --	Forget it.	He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.	And the money?	We could put it somewhere.	Where he can't get it?	Now you thought of that, not me.	Forget it -- he'll come down.
Expecting anyone?	No.	Oh.
Aren't you going to answer it?	Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.	It's the only way.	I refuse.	You're frightened.	No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
You'll wait in the hall?	I'll wait there.	And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?	Everything.	Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.	Alex.	What?	As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Are you all right?	Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --	We were just sorting things out.
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --	Oh, shut up, Alex.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.	That's what I thought he said.
It's about me and David.	The perfect couple, I should say.	You mustn't take it so badly.	Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.	Don't you ever stop?	No.
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.	Let him go. Let him take it all.
Interesting.	I see.	Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see.
So, uh...	What?	What?	You were going to say something.	What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?
It's OK. There's no problem.	You mean I can have the room?	Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
Can you afford this place?	Yeah.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.	What about?	It's about the burglary.	Burglary?	Downstairs.	Of course.	Can we come in?
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.	did you hear anything before he cries?	No, not that I recall, I was asleep.	Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?	No, nothing, sorry.	Well, if you do, you'll let us know?	Of course.	And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?	There are only two other people in the flat.
Two?	Who said there were four?	We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.	No, three. Who said there were four?	How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?	Yes, absolutely.	Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?
I see.	I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?	No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.	Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?	I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.	Someone lost the key.
Is this where no one stays?	Yeah, that's right, that's it.
No, I've never seen them.	You're sure of that.	Yes.	That wasn't a question.
Why do you want a room here?	Do you smoke?
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.	OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.	Did you ever kill a man?
Just get on with it, Alex.	Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
Is this what they always look like?	Yes.
I've never seen a dead body before.	Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Are you all right?	Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.	Would you like to talk about it?	No.
Do you know many of these people?	Yes. They're my friends.
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?	I'm sorry.	It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.	That was stressful. I found that stressful.
Two hundred.	Two hundred pounds?	Two hundred pounds.	You paid two hundred pounds for this?	That's what it cost, David.	No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
Expecting anyone?	What?	Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?	No.	Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?	No one. I promise.	Who have you talked to?	No one.	If I think you're lying --
I thought you'd gone to work.	With a face like this?
I'm sorry.	I should hope so.
We already know. All about it.	It was on the television.
So let's go.	You and me?
Yes.	And you need your sleep.
Eh, I don't know.	Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.	What?	That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.	It wasn't like that.	Don't lie to me. Don't treat me like that.
What do we do here, David?	Sorry?	Here.	Right here?	In this firm.	Well, it's a wide range of, eh --	Accounting, David, chartered accounting --	Exactly what I was --	-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?	Not any real sneering as such, no.	There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?	Eh --	But they sneer, don't they?	I'm not sure --	Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.	Yes, sir.	And that's why I think you fit in here.	I'm boring?	You get the job done.	Oh, I see, I thought you meant --	Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
Hello.	What happened to that guy?	What guy?	That guy, the one that died.
What guy that died?	That one, last week.	Here?.	Yeah, here, I mean, where else?	Oh, him. Well, he died.	That's what I thought.
You must be Hugo.	You must be Juliet.	Would you like to come in?	I'd be delighted.
It's nice.	Would you like to see the rest?
What do you do?	Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.	What's it about?	A priest who dies.	I see.	Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.	No.	Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.	Writing seems easy.	It's a breeze.
Do you think you could answer that?	The telephone? It continues to ring.	Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.	No.	All right.
It was some guy called Brian.	Did he sound upset?	A little bit. Is that good or bad?	It's an improvement.
Shall I answer it?	No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
Working nights?	I'm a doctor.	And he's a patient of yours?	No. But he needs treatment.	For what?	A certain weakness.	The human condition.	You know about it?	I write about it?	And that's not the same thing?	No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.	That sounds fine.	Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?	What?	Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.	Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.	It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.	The first one was fine.	Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?
Take all the time you like, doctor.	I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.	Look again if you like.
No. I haven't seen them.	Do you think you have a good memory for faces?	Same as everyone else.	But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?	Yes.	And what do you recognize, names or faces?	Diseases.	Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.	I suppose so.	I mean, that's what it's like.	Sorry?	And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
Both, sir.	Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
Offering it for debate.	It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
You can tell by the intonation.	One other thing. Do you have any tattoos?
Your watch.	Is it real?	Or a fake?
You're in a good mood today, George.	Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?	Chicken salad.	Chicken salad, Devra!
Anyway, you remember Harold?	Yeah, baby, how's it going?
Don't you think there's too much gold?	It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...	I don't know, I think...	Look, would you argue with your doctor?	No.
I thought you were in a good mood.	I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.	Don't you like her?	No, it's a very groovy girl.	Then what's the problem?	She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.	What're you talking about, George?	Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
Do you think George is a fairy?	Who?	That kid... the hairdresser.	Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.	Maybe... why do you ask?	I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.	Why?	Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.	I don't know. He's a hairdresser.	You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?	Yes, but... I thought...	What?	That you were just indulging me.	No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
That's George.	It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --	Lester, don't you think that uhh --
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.	What do you expect me to do about it?	I just thought you'd like to know --	Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
Lester.	Yes, sweetheart, shh.
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --	-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---	-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.	Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
We cannot go into this later.	That's okay too.	You make me sick. Just be straight for once in your life.
-- is that right?	-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
-- is that what this is all about?	Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --	Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.	What are you talking about?	-- think what you have time to think, Lester.
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?	No.
What're you looking for?	My keys.	I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.	I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.	You mean that girl, don't you?
Thanks a lot.	Listen, baby, don't leave, really.	Why not?	I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.	What?	These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
She's got a...	Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?	Yeah, I think so.	That's very serious. Who's her doctor?	I don't know.	Gee, that's very serious...	I know.	Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.	She did?	It turned out to be cancer.	Wow.	So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.	I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.	You're very rude... if you don't come back --	I'll be back in a while.	I don't want to see you anymore.	I'll be right back, baby, really.
You're late, George.	I gotta talk to you.	I don't want to talk about it...	But you don't know what happened.	I don't care.
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.	Calm down, baby.	I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...	-- What?	Nummers.	What?	-- Numbers, and I don't need to place myself in that kind of position.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.	I don't want to place you in any position --	-- to be put in that kind of position...	I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
George --	I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.	What kind of treatment?	I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.	Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
I can see that.	You're looking great, baby.	What're you doing later?	Whatever you say.	We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.	What about?	All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.	Why don't you see Lester?	Your husband?	Yes.	What about?	The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.	Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
Is she all right?	I don't know. Just a minute...
-- Anyway.	I hope she's all right.	She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?	I wouldn't say so if I didn't.	No, I know.	And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.	I know.	I mean it or I wouldn't say it.	That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
Hi.	Hello, George.
Comb my hair out later, honey.	No, that's okay, I'll do It now.	No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
But aren't you...	Right now, I just don't care.
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?	Well she...	She what?	She's a friend of Jill's.	And who's Jill?
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.	Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?	Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See?
Oh, no.	... what?...	That headboard.	Nobody can hear it.
You going to answer it?	Uh-uh.
Want me to?	Let it ring.
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.	Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.	You know what I'm talking about.	No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.	Like what?	I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
Well, is she your girlfriend?	No.	Are you in love with her?	Her?	Are you?	No.	Then it's not your problem.	It isn't?	No. You know too many sick ladies.	I guess so.	How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...	I guess so.	Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.	Okay.	God, I adore you.
Shit.	Hello.
You here to see my mother?	Yeah.	She's out, but you're supposed to wait.	Hungry?	A little.
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?	No thanks.	You're my mother's hairdresser?	I do her hair, yeah.	Chopped liver?	No thanks.	Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.	No thanks.	Did you hear me?	Yeah.	Well, are you? Are you queer?	... yeah.	C'mon, are you or aren't you?	Gee, this is great.
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.	Why do you wanna know so bad?	See if you've been making it with my mother.	What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?	Have you ever made it with a girl?	I asked you first.	Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
Well, are you?	Am I what?	Making it with my mother?
I'd like to do your hair sometime.	Why?	... just, you could look very heavy...	Don't make conversation with me.	What?	You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
Yeah, it is.	I never get my hair done.	No kidding.	In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.	No shit.	You think that's funny, don't you?	Yeah.	You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.	Yeah...	Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?	No.	Then what do you think?	That you're just like your mother.	I am not like my mother!	You are.	I am not!	You are.
I am not!	Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?	Yeah.
Right now?	Yeah.
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.	Right.	How is she?	Great.	Wonderful woman.	She is.	I went to school with her husband.	Great.	So you want to go in business for yourself?	Right.	And you need money?	Right, that's right.	You do know what money's like these days.	Well, yeah... you know.
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.	They are?	After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.	I guess not...	It's got nothing to do with inflation. Rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. Historically, that's always been true, though most people don't realize it.
What sort of references do you have?	Well, I do Barbara Rush.	Pardon me?	Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.	I mean credit references, Mr. Roundy.
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.	Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
George!	Yeah.	You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.	Buffums?	Yes, Buffums.	I've got heads here, Norman.	You promised you'd do the show.	Oh fuck, Norman!	Don't use that tone of voice with me... never mind, I'll take Gordon.
You're late, George.	Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
What!	Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.	You do it.	Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.	You are today.
So how's Norman?	Great. Who's been doing your hair?
Jesus...	-- Yeah... your car down here?
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.	-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?	I don't know. Probably not.	Jill's really great, isn't she?	Great... so how's everything with you?
How long you had this?	Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.	I'm sure.	He's a very private person, actually.	Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
-- Well no. It never came up.	You going to tell him?	-- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?	No, thanks.	Well, I do.
Where do you want to do this?	Probably the bathroom.	Can't you do it out here?
Well, what do you think?	I'd cut it...	You would?	Yeah, I think so...	You don't seem very sure.	No, I'm sure.
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?	Okay.
Jill's coming with us.	Great.	She's incredible...  She loves you, George.	Yeah... I mean great.
... I don't get it done often.	Whew.	What's wrong?	It's hot in here.	It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.	Yeah... wow.
Not too much, don't cut too much.	Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.	The shrink? Many times.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.	Do you? You still see him?
No.	Why not?
Why not?	... he tried to... uh... make it with me.	And?	And what?	Did you?
It was after you, baby. After you.	Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?	No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...	Did Lester know about him?	There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.
George...	I just have to do one little thing.	If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.	I won't screw you up.
George... how about Felicia?	What?	Did you?	Did I what?	You know what I'm talking about.	Hey, I don't tell.	Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.	Yeah?	Well, did you or didn't you?
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?	You did, didn't you?
Baby...	You did, I know you did.	One of my few virtues is discretion.	You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
George...	Yeah, baby...	You're a genius.
No! Don't! Please!	I don't want to... I swear...
It'll ruin everything.	I know... you don't know, I know.	Don't, don't, don't...
Sit down.	What are you talking about?	Sit down!
Look, either come in or stay out!	Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...	-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?	-- what guy?	-- this guy with Jill.	He's a director.
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.	What about it?	Looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job I've --
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.	You don't do that anymore, do you?
Don't do it.	That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --	C'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk.
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.	Sweetheart, you're drunk.
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.	-- we can't now.	-- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
-- don't you want to --	Jackie, can we --	Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon --
-- you are.	Fuckin' A --
-- gee...	-- what?	I don't know what gets into me.	You were great.	No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.	No you didn't.	You don't think so? I do.	You were great.	You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
That sounds like me.	I am you, you little bastard.
Where do you want to go?	Sammy's?	He still having parties?	He never stopped.
What are you looking at?	The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
-- yeah.	-- look, you don't have to entertain me...	Am I entertaining you?	We're friends.	-- sure.	-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
-- where'd you go?	-- oh I thought you were --	-- what?	Nothing.
-- very nice, very nice.	-- mmm --
-- but you never were much of a tit man --	Mmmm --	-- ass and legs --	Look who's talking.	Me?	-- yes, you --	Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?	Not me, pal.
What's wrong?	-- do you want ice?
-- we're kidding ourselves.	-- we are?	-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.	Why?	I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.
-- Jesus --	-- well you better go after her.
-- good afternoon --	-- you've got to leave.
I've got to leave?	-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.	Why?	Lester's on his way.
Where are you going?	Please, we'll have to talk later --	Look about last night --	Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --	It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?	Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
-- It's Malone's.	That's it, then I'm leaving.
You're going to kill me.	No --	Well then what are you trying to do-	I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.	If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...	So I'm saying it...	It's too late...	What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.	Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.	So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.	What's that supposed to mean?	I don't know... Jackie?	What?
God, there's Lester...	Don't go, Jackie...	I can't just let him stand by the door...	Don't leave me...	I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.	What for?	I don't know -- I've got to.
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?	No, man.	-- Right after I sprayed her?	What?	She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.	She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?	Wanda...	Oh yeah?	You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.	Yeah?...	She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.	I'm busy, man.	If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!	Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
Yeah!	Wash her.	What with?	-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.	-- Oh yeah.	But then again you ask for it -- you just like my Otis -- can't keep his hands outta ladies' hair either.
-- White ladies?	-- Oh my yes.
That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?	I don't know if you don't know --
What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?	Otis is dead.	-- Otis?
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...	-- oh -- sweetheart...	-- you shouldn't do me like that...	-- please, please forgive me...	-- you know better...	-- why did you come in today?	-- left my bag, didn't have no money...	-- how did you get here?	-- took a bus.	-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
Jackie Shawn.	-- yeah, this is --	-- yes, George.	I guess you haven't heard from her yet.	Not yet.	Okay... thanks...
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.	That's too bad.	I have to see you.	Hey, stop by the shop.
Hi, George.	Hey, baby, what's happening?	Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.	Great, great. I hope you make it.
Call me!	I don't have your number, stop by the shop.	Okay!
There were some shots.	What're you talking about?	Gunshots, there were some gunshots.	Where?	Here in the canyon.	Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.	Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.	What's gonna happen?	I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.	Well, like what?	I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
I've had these dumb dreams lately.	What?	They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...	Who?	I just... who what?	You said somebody... who?
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.	No shit?
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.	George, I don't --	You'll do what I tell you. Now get the fuck inside.
George --	Keep moving --	Now, George --	Nobody's gonna get you but me!
How are you, baby?	Fine. How are you?	Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.	What?	I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.	How?	Right now -- I'm at the epitome of my life. Right now I feel so good I'm afraid something's gonna happen.
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.	Honey, what happened?	I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.	I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.	I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.	What about me?	You're different.	I am?	You're great.	I am?	Yeah.	Do you really mean that?	Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
Honey?	Yeah, baby.	Why am I great?
Will we live together?	We live together now.	But in the same house, you know, one house.	-- Sure.
Maybe you don't even like children.	Of course I like children.	You've never even been around one.	I'm around you and I like you, don't I?	Yeah.	Okay...  Night, baby.	George?	What!	Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...	Okay, baby. Okay...	Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
George.	Hey, baby, what's happening?	They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.	Great.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.	Hello.
Yeah, baby...	How did it go at the bank?
Great.	Could I talk to you for a second?	Hey, I'm, you know --	Could I?
Yeah.	I said I wasn't sure if I could go.	Go where?	Egypt!	Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?	Okay, but how did it go at the bank?	Great... can we talk later?
George.	Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.	I already said hello.	Okay.	George.	Yeah, baby.	When can I talk to you?	Baby, I'm in the middle of work.	I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.	About what?	Whether or not I'm going.	Going where?	Egypt.	Honey, have they offered you the job?	No, but I think they might.	Just a second, I'll be right with you...
What do you want?	Your advice!	They didn't offer you the job yet.	I want your feelings about it.	Right now?	Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.	Look, baby, can we talk about it later?
When?	When I get off work.	When is that?	I'll call you.	When is that, George?	I'll call you.	But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!	Neither do I, baby.	What?	Nothing, I'll call you, okay?	... Okay...
Jill says nothing.	Where's your car?	A friend dropped me off.	Who?	Never mind. Where've you been?	A business meeting, I told you that.
What business meeting?	Look at the way I live.	I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?	What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.	I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.	Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
I know, honey.	Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.	Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
What does he direct besides traffic?	Ha, ha.	Television or movies?	Commercials.
Now, Jackie --	-- she's a very compulsive girl.
I've got to get her out of here.	-- go ahead.	-- well aren't you --	-- what?  -- I'll see you later...	-- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
I don't want to fight, George.	I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.	Bullshit.	I do, Jill.
How come you took your own car?	I didn't want him meeting me here.	Well that's something.	What is.	You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.
You did fuck him, didn't you?	I'm very tired, George.
Didn't you, baby?	Let go of me.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.	Oh, Christ.
That was him.	Yes.	You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
Yes.	Well, did you get a job out of it at least?	I'd like you to leave now.
-- and take this with you.	Where did this come from?	Who knows, I'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?	Baby, don't do this. I do love you.	Obviously there were others, weren't there?
Obviously.	How many?	What do you wanna know for?	I just want to know, that's all.	What difference does it make?	I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
Baby, please don't... I love you.	I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!	Baby, don't do this --	-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.	-- please, baby --	-- no, it'll help me, really --	How?	I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
... well I'm glad you told me.	Jesus.
What? What? What? What? What?	... honest. At least you're honest with me.	Does it make you happy?
I wish you'd go now.	That's all you've got to say?	-- yes.	-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?	George...	Did you?	Please!... that's not like you.	Yeah, I know. Did you?	George, now cut this out.	Did you?	Stop it.	Did you?	Yes, yes, I did.	What did you say?	George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.	What did you say?	George...	What did you say?	I said you were a loser!
What're you here for?	-- A wash and set.	No.	No?	You need a cut.	But Mr. Norman said --	Said what!	I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.	Well, baby, I'm George and it needs to be cut.  But I don't want to place you in that position either.
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.	Well, yeah.	She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.	Thank you.	I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.	I see.
It's an unusual trade.	Yes it is.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.	In a way. But...	But what?	I'm better than the guy I work for.
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.	After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
It's good you want to do something, George.	Thank you.	But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.	They're not?	No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?	You're right.	Who needs that kind of aggravation? Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? When I finish work I want to...
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?	Sure.
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?	Oh yeah.
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.	Oh yeah? I mean I know.	So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.
When?	When?
Tonight?	Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.	Okay.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.	Oh yeah?	-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.	I know what you mean.
Sorry, honey, I...	That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
... she's very upset...	What about, tonight?	That, and... I'll be done in a minute.
You look like you've had quite a work-out.	It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.	I know it, I know it.	... this doing hair it's...	I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.	Oh, hey...	It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --	I don't know what to...	Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --	-- yeah?	See she doesn't drink too much.
Well anyway...	Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?	Isn't that bad for it?	No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.
This really ought to be layered...	Layered?	Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
You live like a pig.	Yeah.  How long have you been here?	All night.	Well... who are those guys?	What do they look like?...	Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?	Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.	Well, what?	Godammit, George...	Now wait a minute...	Sit down.	But...	I said sit down!
I wanna hear about it.	Oh Jesus Christ.
I wanna hear about it, George.	Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.	I wanna hear about it.	What can I say!	I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!	I'm not anti-Establishment.	That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.	Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.	No, not yet, not yet. You worry about it for a while, I've been worrying all night, now you can worry.
Was it me, did you have something against me?	What, do you think I planned it?	Did they have something against me?	Didn't they tell you?	I wanna hear it from you!	... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.	We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?	Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...	Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.	Why, why do you think that is?	Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?	Well, I don't know.
Want a drink?	No thanks.	Have a drink.	Okay, thanks.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.	I know.	I'll have to wash one out.
Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.	Who?	Me!	Hey, you were never going to give me the money.	I was gonna give you the money. Probably I was. Shit, I don't know, I don't know anything anymore.
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!	Oh yeah...	Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.	I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.	What about Jackie?	What about her?	I mean, how did that happen?	Lester, it just happened.	She's nothing but a whore.	No --	Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.	No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
You really think so?	Yes I do.	I'm finished with her.
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.	What?	Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows -- I don't know.
What took you so long?	Wasn't sure it was you.		I... uh... I... uh... can't.	All right, who're you with? Jill?	No.		No.	Awww --	I'll call you back.	Come on by.	I'll call you back...		Okay, okay...
You're home.	Yeah.	I'm coming over.	I'll call you back.	No you won't.	What do you mean?	I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.	Okay.		Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.	A soap?	A daytime soap opera.	And?	I was too old.	What was it, somebody's daughter?	Somebody's mother.
Well maybe I can get you something.	That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.	Sid.	Sid. You must be a very important executive.	Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.	You do?	Yes.	-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.	How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.	Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.	Is that right?	Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.	Is that right?
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.	George is going to open a shop.	No kidding? Your own shop?
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.	I am?	Who were you talking to?	Who do you think I was talking to?	My secretary saw you with that boy.	Steve?	Whatever his name is, that actor.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.	Then you were talking to him.	I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.	I'm not jealous of the dogs.
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.	So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!	Of course not.	That's not very logical, Lester.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...	Really? How about starting with tonight?
You and your touchy investors.	Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.	What's that?	You're still jealous.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?	Fine.
Shut the door, shut the door!	Oh, I'm sorry.
I'd like a drink.	Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.	You ought to get rid of those dogs.
They get hair all over the place.	They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Here.	Aren't you going to have one?	No.	Why not?	Because I don't want one.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.	Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.	Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.
Who are they?	Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.	Does she know about us?	Jesus, she's my best friend.	Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?	I don't know. Why don't you ask him?	C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
Hi, doll, what's wrong?	You know what's wrong.
Jackie Shawn.	Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
-- you phony asshole --	Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
Hi, Leonard.	Jackie, what're you doing?	Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?	I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
Poster-Kleiser.	Oh yeah?	That's right.	I'll call you.	Fine.	See you later.	Anyway, you're crazy.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.	Who is that?	A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
I am? I mean why?	Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.	I'm not. Maybe I am.	No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
Well, he is.	So what's your point?	Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.	I know, I'm sorry.	I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?	George is great but I know what you mean.	Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.	I guess not.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?	Don't be silly.	You're really a love -- you sure?	-- No. No really.	Well, what is it, honey?	Nothing.	It must be something.	Well, it's George.	I thought you said things were great with George.	Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?	We don't think marriage is important.	But you have problems?	-- Yeah, honey...	I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
Five times a day?	-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.	Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?	Well, you know what I mean.	After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.	I'm exaggerating.	How much?	Jackie --	What?	Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.	He does?	Well yes -- you know that about George.	It's been so long I don't how long?	Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?	I would say so, yes.	Honey?	What?	I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?	-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?	-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.	-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.	C'mon.	Well, there was this one time --	-- Yesss?	-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...	-- uhh-huhh...	-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...	... Mmm-hmmm.
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...	Didn't you have any panties on?	-- He reached up and tore them.	What did you do?	Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.	No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?	No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
Egypt?	That's right.	But why Egypt?	Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.	Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Oh. thank you.	Sure.
Why don't you ask for another one?	Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.	... my friend doesn't like it here either.	All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.	Well he's not exactly a friend.	Is he an enemy?	Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.	-- sort of a boyfriend?	Sort of.	I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.	Johnny!	My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
I'm terribly sorry.	-- never mind.	What does he do? Is he an actor?	-- no.	Good for you.	He's a hairdresser.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?	Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?	Not with your hairdresser.
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?	Well... sure...	Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
George? Was he alone?	I don't think so.	Well did he go in there with Jackie?
That bastard.	George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --	-- oh I don't know --
Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.	Let's do that.
-- why?	-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?	Of course not.
-- so when are you going to Egypt?	You mean when are you going to Egypt?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.	Two weeks from tomorrow.	You're going?	You're going.
You're kidding.	Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.	Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?	-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
What's wrong?	We can't really leave that poor man here alone.	-- he'll never know the difference.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.	I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
-- what's the problem, honey?	-- his car. They have it blocked.	Oh that's no problem.  -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.	Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
-- I'll get in the back --	-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...	-- there's not much room --	That's fine --
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?	Jill.	Jill.
-- yes, Jill.	Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.	Thank you.	-- just wonderful.
You seem disappointed.	No... how long did you say?	Three weeks.
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.	No, it's not that...	Do you have children?	No.	Are you married?	No.	Do you have something against traveling?	No.
No!	John...
We'll let you know tomorrow.	Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.	Thanks for coming by.
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.	Have they sat down?	Everybody but us.
No of course not.	-- we're going to be here all night.
Everything okay, son?	Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Call me Les.	Where to, Les?	Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.	Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Dad?	Yes?	I'm hungry.	Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.	What was the Donner party?
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.	You mean they ate each other up?	They had to, in order to survive.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?	Come here for a minute, first.
How's it going, Doc?	Okay.
Are you having a good time?	Yes, Dad.	Good.  I want you to have a good time.	I am, Dad.  Dad?	Yes.	Do you feel bad?
No.  I'm just a little tired.	Then why don't you go to sleep?	I can't.  I have too much to do.	Dad?	Yes?	Do you like this hotel?
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?	I guess so.	Good.  I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
Dad?	What?	You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?	What do you mean?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?	No, Dad.	Are you sure?	Yes, Dad.
I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?	Yes, Dad.	Good.
Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?	No.
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?	French Fries and Ketchup.
Do you like ice cream, Doc?	Yeah.
Chocolate.	Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
Why don't you want to talk about it?	I'm not supposed to.	Who says you ain't supposed to?	Tony.	Who's Tony?	Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.	Is Tony the one that tells you things?
Yes.	How does he tell you things?
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.	Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?	Yes.	Do they know he tell you things?
I don't know.	Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Maybe he showed me something.	Try to think what it was.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.	Is there something bad here?
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.	Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.	Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.	What about Room 237?	Room 237?	You're scared of Room 237, ain'tcha?
No I ain't.	Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?	Nothing.  There ain't nothing in Room 237, but you ain't got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  You understand, stay out!
Yeah.	Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?	Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.	Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.	Yeah, I know.  It always takes a little time to make new friends.
Yeah, I guess so.	What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?	Okay.
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?	Okay, Mom.	Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
Jack...	Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Yeah.	Danny, come on over here.
Yeah.	Okay.  You behave yourself.
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?	All right.	And you're gonna lose.  And I'm gonna get you - you betta run fast! Look out - I'm coming in close. All right?
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?	Okay...oh!	Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.	Yeah.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.	Yeah.
It's so pretty.	Yeah.	I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?	No.
Mom?	Yes?	Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?	Not right now, Daddy's asleep.	I won't make any noise.	Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?	I won't make a sound, I promise. I'll tip-toe.
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.	I won't, Mom.
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?	Okay, Mom.
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.	Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Danny?	Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Red Rum.	Danny... what's the matter, hon?	Red Rum.	Are you having a bad dream?
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!	Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Mommy...	Danny, come here!	Mommy... Mommy...!	Danny!
Mommy!	Oh!
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?	No.	Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?	Yes.
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?	Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?	Talking to Tony.	Is Tony one of your animals?	No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
Oh,	if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?	No.	Why not?	Because he hides.	Where does he go?	To my stomach.	Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?	Do I have to?	Yes, I'd like you to.
Shall we go into the living room?	Yes.
Please...	Thank you.
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.	Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
But eh what was the matter with him?	Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?	Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.	Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
Tony.	Did Tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?	No, um let's see I guess Danny started talkin to Tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
What sort of injury did he have?	Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
How did he manage to do that?	Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Oh I wouldn't think of it.	Well how can I repay you?	It's okay, really.	Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?	Sure.	Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.	Advocaat is it?	Yes sir.  Look um... I think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.	Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.	Fine.
Grady?	Yes, sir.	Delbert Grady.	That's right, sir.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?	Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.	Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?	Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.	And, er... where are they now?	Oh, they're somewhere around.  I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
No.	He is, Mr. Torrance.	Who?	A nigger.	A nigger!	A nigger cook.
How?	Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.	Well, he is a very willful boy.
She eh... interferes.	Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.	Grady... oh.
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.	Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.	Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.	For the moment, Mr. Grady.  Only for the moment.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.	There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.	You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
Good evening.  Forest Service.	Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.	Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?	Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?	Thank you very much.  I'll do that.	All right, sir.
Good evening.  Forest Service.	Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.	Sure.	This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.	Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.	It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.	No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.	Nice to meet you.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?	I'm a Wendy.	Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.	God.  This is the kitchen, huh?	Yeah, this is it.  How do you like it, Danny?  Is it big enough for you?
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.	I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.	Well one thing for sure, you don't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
Beg pardon?	Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.	I did?	Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?	Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.
No, we don't mind.	Good.	Sound good to you, Danny?
Bill, how do you do?	Pleased to meet you.	Pleasure to meet you.
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.	What line of work are you in now?	I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.	Well this ought to be quite a change for you.	Well, I'm looking for a change.
What'll it be?	Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
How's my credit in this joint anyway?	Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.	That's swell.  I like you, Lloyd. I always liked you.  You were always the best of them.
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.	Thank you for saying so.
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?	Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.	I hope it's nothing serious.
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.	Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.	Good evening Mr. Torrance.
It's good to see you.	It's good to be back, Lloyd.	What'll it be, sir?
No charge?	Your money's no good here.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.	It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
Hi, babe.	Hi, hon.  How's it going?	Great.  Look, I'm at the hotel and I still have an awful lot to go through.  I don't think I can get home before nine or ten.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.	Uh...huh.
Sure is.	God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
Perfect for a child.	Yeah.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.	What time is it?	It's about eleven thirty.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!	I guess we've been staying up too late.	I know it.
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.	Hmm, nice.
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?	Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
Any ideas yet?	Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.	Yeah... that's all it is.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?	I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.	Yeah.  It's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place.  I tell you, when we first came up here, I thought it was kinda scarey.
What do you want me to do about it?	Ah, come on hon.  Don't be so grouchy.
I'm not being grouchy.  I just want to finish my work.	Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.	Wendy,  let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?	Yes.	Fine.  Now we're going to make a new rule.  Whenever I am in here and you hear me typing,
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?	Yes.	Fine.  Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.	It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.	I dreamed that I... that I killed you and Danny.
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.	Which room was it?
Did you find anything?	No, nothing at all.
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?	Yes, I did.	And you didn't see anything at all?	Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
He's still asleep.	Good.
Somebody did that to him.	I think he did it to himself.
Get him out of here?	Yes.	You mean just leave the hotel?	Yes.
Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?	Jack...	Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life so far, but I'm not going to let you fuck this up!
Jack!	How do you like it?
I...	I can't really remember.	You can't remember.
I don't know.	I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.	You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?	Yes...	When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
As soon as possible.	Jack...
Of course I am.	Of course you are.
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?	Oh Jack, what are you talking about?	Have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? Have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
Stay away from me!	Why?	I just want to go back to my room.	Why?
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!	I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me,	Wendy!	Stay away...!	Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Stay away from me!	I'm not going to hurt you.	Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!  Please...	Stop swinging the bat.	Stay away from me.	Put the bat down, Wendy.	Stop it!	Wendy give me the bat.	Stay... stay away!	Give me the bat.
Stay away from me.	Give me the bat.	Jack, stay away from me!	Stop swinging the bat.	Get down.
Give me the bat.	Go away from me.
Wendy...	Go away.	Give me the bat.	Go away.	Give me the bat.
I'll bring back a doctor.	Wendy...	I'm gonna go now.	Wendy...
Mr. Ullman?	Yes?	I'm Jack Torrance.	Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Very nice to meet you.	Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Have any trouble finding us?	Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.	Well, that's very good time, very good.  Please sit down a minute.
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?	Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.	Susie.
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.	Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.	Oh, it sure would be
Only in a very general way.	Well...	...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.	Well, that sounds fine to me.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.	Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh...
five months of peace is just what I want.	That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...	can of itself be a problem.	Not for me.	How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?	They'll love it.	Great...
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.	I'm intrigued.	I don't suppose they eh told you anything in Denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
I don't believe they did.	Well, my predecessor in this job
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are	shut in together over long periods of time.	Well, that is eh quite a story.
Well, obviously some people can be	put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.	Well, you can rest assured Mr. Ullman, that's not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, I am sure she'll be absolutely fascinated when I tell her about it.  She's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.	No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?	No, my son's discovered the games room.	Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
Right there.	Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
I'd better collect my family first.	Oh...
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.	Well, it's very... homely.
This is our Colorado Lounge.	Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.	Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.	Royalty?	All the best people.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.	Oh!
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.	Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.	Oh, I'll say.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.	Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Thanks.	Thank you, Susie.
Hi.	Hi.	How're you getting on?
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.	Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.	Just like a ghost ship, huh?	Yes.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.	How do you do?
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.	Fine.	Jack is a schoolteacher.
What time does the plane leave?	Eight thirty.	Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.	Fine.
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!	Uncle Al-
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?	I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.	Why hasn't he picked up the phone and told Constable Haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
Lowe's car-?	Blue. This blue.	Jesus.
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?	I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
Can I tell you kids something?	Sure, Uncle Al.	When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
The moon's not down yet...	Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!	Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.	Brady's a booger and so are you!
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.	If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
What's the money for?	A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?	I don't want your money. You're a booger.	It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?	What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?	Stop it!
Yes. Go away.	Let me help you up.
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.	Where's Mom?	Went shopping. Why?	Jane, I have to talk to you.
Jane... you don't have to do that.	Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.	Will you marry me, Jane?
Please, Uncle Al.	Will you?
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!	Jane-
Are you all right, Marty?	All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.	You're a real booger, you know it?
You booger.	That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.	What's that?	Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.	For getting a divorce?	Well... it is his third.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...	Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
There's something else scary.	What?
I've been hearing noises in there.	What kind of noises?	Rattling. Rustling.	Rats...	And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.	Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?	Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!	Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.	Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
Mom-!	Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
You all right, Marty?	Yeah.	There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?	No.	Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.	Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?	Huh?	What if it's some kind of monster?
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?	A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.	And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...	It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.	Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.	I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.	Don't call me dear boy.	But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
Your mom's not around, is she?	She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.	Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that adjustable.
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.	What?	Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
You got a pilot's license, Marty?	Do I need one?	We're gonna find out. Take it down the road a ways and back. Be careful.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.	It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.	It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.	I don't get you.	I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?	Sure.	Good.
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.	Yeah! What is it?
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.	Yeah, I know. It's great!	One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?	Yeah... sure.	Save this one for last.
What is it?	A tracer. You'll like it.	Thanks a million, Uncle Al!	You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!	I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.	Was it a prescription?	What the hell does that matter?	It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.	Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!	Well... was it a prescription?	I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.	What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!	You want to know what I think?	No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.	Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.	Marty, do you see your suspect?
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.	I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-	When he was a werewolf. Yes. Right. Jesus. Jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.	I told you!	Shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.	I told you!
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.	There! You see!	It could have been anything, Marty.	What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?	No.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!	And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.	You're not going to let it go, are you?	I saw what I saw.	Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.	The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.	I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.	Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.	Will you do it?
Yeah? Really?	Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.	But Uncle Al! You said-	I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten past one. He's not coming.
What if I say no?	Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
I come here because Marty needs a friend.	Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.	See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-	-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!	We won't!
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!	If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.	I will- be good, kids.
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.	Oh?	I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.	Well... thank you.
I can't wait until next Sunday, when the choir performs again.  Did you see the people walk right in from the street? That music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.	Perhaps.	I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.	Really?
Really.	Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.	Well... yes.  Yes it is.
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?	Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?	What about crack?  You a user?	I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED	What you say?	LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
But how?	BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH	I think I hear it!	LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED	You know, I just might!	LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
LET THY SPIRIT	You know what we're saying!	LET THY SPIRIT	I think they hear you!
He's... dreamy.  He's...	Yes, Mary?	HE'S SO FINE...
SING!	Were you tempted?	SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!
But I'm fearful!	SING!	And I'm tearful!	SING!	YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE
So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?	We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
How come?  Sister?	"Well... because it's in the Bible. ""Thou shalt not...""  Thou shalt not."
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?	'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.	Probation?
Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.	And you listen to that?	No, but... I don't know... sometimes.	Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.	What you do?	Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
How are you doing.	Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?	You know it.
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!	You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.	Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit the road.
His ashes?	With love.
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.	Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?	What?	You can handle this.
Okay, Christy -- strip.	What?	That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it off.
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?	What did who say?	Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.
You are so damn sexy.	Vince...	How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?	Today was the deadline, Vince.
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.	You did what?
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.	You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?	He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn in Hell.  For all eternity.
What?	You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?	You bastard!	We can still see each other.  Just like always.  It's a different kind of sin. Smaller.	You pig!
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!	You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
No... it's fine.	Yes?	Thanks.  A lot.	Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?	Sure.	And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.	Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten.
Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.	Good evening, Vincent.	What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?	I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.	I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.	Joey -- do it.
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!	That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
Oh, girls.	Yes, Betty?	This prom is a real drag.	Oh-huh.	Oh my!	What is it, Betty?	Look at that.  Get a gander.	Oh my!	He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...	Yes, Betty?	HE'S SO FINE.	D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.	WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?	Right.
Where did that come from?	I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.	No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?	Not in years.	Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.	Why?	To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.	But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.	Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.	Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?	Just about.  Show me again.	You betcha.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.	I love my heddles.  Show me again.
Is this... choir practice?	Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
Hold on.	Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.	Chops?	The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with the sopranos.
Two days.  An hour or so.	No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
That machine.	I know.  It's ancient.	It's a rhythm section.  The beat.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?	The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE	Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?	Am I?
"All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, ""That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."""	So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE	Because we're
We know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. We'll pray to find you some honest work.	And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
What is it, Mary?	That man -- who is he?
Jackpot!  Two buckets	This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
Hurry, Sister!	Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE	It's true -- I know her.	DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE	What a shame!	BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS	Pay attention...	SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!	Were you wicked?
Which convent?  It was, um, the Little Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside.	Enough jabber.
What?	Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.	Like this place?	I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
Shirelles.	You know that song?
Soprano or alto?	Whatever.
Mary Clarence, are you with us?	Um, I don't really know this one...
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.	Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.	What?	You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.	Mary Robert.
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.	I knew that.	Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline.  Hard work.
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.	I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.	Wet behind the ears.	A bunch of real mama's girls.
It'll be hell.	Tell me about it.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!	Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!	Hopeless I	Amateurs 2	Babies	Again!
She's a pro.	What?
Is there any syrup?	Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.	That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
Van Cartier.	You know?  About me?  About everything?
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?	You re okay -- for a civilian.
JUST SING!	Sing!
Come on, we're late.	What?  What time is it?	It's after five.  We have to bathe.	Five a.m.?
What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?	I... I...
What?	I... I brought you something.	A cigarette?	An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?	Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.	Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?	Three years.  Sister.	Three years.  A rookie.	A novice.	Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? When do you hit the big time?  You know, when do you take the final vows?
You have to help me	Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.	No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?	Excuse me?	Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!	She won't?  Why not?	She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.	She said that?  Reverend Mother?
Well, then there's only one thing to do.	What?	Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life.  In order to make a responsible decision.  This is going to be very painful for me.  You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent.  Wait.
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.	Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?	We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.	Are you sure?
Mary Clarence!	Now you.
We need experience.	It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
Bobs	Experience!  Right?	Right.
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.	Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.	Really?
Who are all these people?	This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
I'm getting experience.	You watch yourself!
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?	Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.	Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.	Honey.
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.	Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
Mary Clarence!	Keep moving!
Goddamn it!	Mary Clarence!
Oh my Lord!	Experience!
What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?	I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.	We could have been killed!  But you saved me!  Thank you, Mary Clarence!
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...	Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
What?	Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.	I don't want to mess anyone up...	Give me a C.  A C!
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART	HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.	We're nuns!
It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.	A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
Are you leaving us?	Oh no.  We'll always be together.
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?	Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?	They're from my old convent.
Run!  Take off!	Again?
But what do they want?  Where are we going?	She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
Mary Clarence!	Bless you.
I WAS DOWNHEARTED	It's true!	I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING	Don't you know it!	BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME	What did He say?	HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!
A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?	What is your full name?  Your Christian name?	Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!	Your name?	Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.	Enough joking.	That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.	Very well.	Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening.  It's a nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!
St. Anne's?	Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.	You were unhappy?	I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?	The reason?	Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.	I see.	You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!	Sit down.	What?
Miss Van Cartier.	What?	Your cigarette -- out.
It has come to pass.	What?	I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.	Are you talking about me?	And all those like you.	You mean black people?	Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.	What's a concubine?	Check your driver's license.
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?	Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?	Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change	Deal.
"How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  ""Guest of St. Katherine's"""	Would you like that?
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.	Can do.
No!  No!  I can't do this!	Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.	But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!	As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.	Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb guy?
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...	No problem.	The vow of obedience.	Like to who?
And the vow of chastity.	I'm outta here.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.	A what?	Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.	Silence?  No talking?  All day?	Until sundown.
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.	A what?	A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.	No food?	No food.  Not until sundown.
Is this all the food I get?	Yes.  Until breakfast.	That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any snacks?  Machines?
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.	My what?	Your cell.  Your room.
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?	Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.	Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?	Useless distractions.	It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?	And whom would you call?	Oh, I don't know... Satan?	Your cell is more than adequate.	Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?	It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.	Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.	I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.	What's wrong with my life?	From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead.
Yeah?	Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?	I got it.	Come, Sister.
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.	Mary Clarence!
A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?	Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.	This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.	Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!	We are nuns.  We seek solutions through prayer.
Sometimes it's not enough!	You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?	It never solves anything.	"Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, ""Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."""	In English?	"How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence.  ""No pain, no gain."""
Really catching on.	Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!	Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!	Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
So... hi there.	I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.	Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!	I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!	Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.	A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?	Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.	But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.	I am?	You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.	What?	You have, I believe, some minimal background in music.  Therefore, you are to join our choir.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.	No.  No.	You're my Olympic event.	Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I	The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.
I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.	And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.	Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.	Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!	Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.	Out of the question.	Please let me try.  I'm begging you.	And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.	What do you mean?	The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church.  They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?	I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.	A vote?	Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
But... wait a minute...	The majority has spoken.
You sent for me?	You have a phone call.
Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.	Really.  Well, that makes two of us.	What?	I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.	But -- why?	I must go where I can be of use.	But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.	Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.	But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!	A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.	Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.	I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.	But...	Good day.
What are you doing here?	Saving you.  Move!
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.	Oh?	You saved my life.	I'm a Christian.
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.	Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?	You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.	What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.	Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.	Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?	Don't push it.
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.	At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.	I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.	Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?	So I don't shop.	'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!	Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then.  I told people you were a hooker!
He's a businessman.	A what? When are you qonna wake up?	When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?	Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.	Think again!  And get out of here.
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!	You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?	I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me!  They tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.	He didn't do you a favor.	Screw you!
And if I don't?	Then-you run.
Ten flights?	You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.	All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!	Get a stenographer.
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.	Maybe Hawaii.
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.	Okay -- no limo.	No nothing.	What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?	I'm gonna put you in the last place on Earth that Vince would ever look for you.
I hate you.  I totally hate you.	Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.	It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.	With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.	But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!	Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.	I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?	Pray.
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.	Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.	But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!	Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.	Like what?	Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.	You son-of-a-bitch!
I just need a few more weeks,	But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!	Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
What'd she say?	You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.	Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?	She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.	So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?	Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!	What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?	It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.	You're supposed to be hiding out!	I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.	Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.	I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's about the choir.  You should hear them. They're good.  Really good.  And I taught them.	Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.	I am?	Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..	Really?  Lieutenant?	I've been worried about you.
You mean -- worried about my testimony?	No -- worried about you.  Personally.
Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.	Me too.	You're not... seeing anybody?	No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.	I have?	You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
I've got to go.	Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?	I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll try.
Vince knows you're here.	How?	Long story.  His goons will be here any minute.  We've got to get you out of here '- now!
I can't go with you.	What?	I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.	You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.	I think they'd understand.	That's not the point!  They need me!
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?	"You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... ""Star Search."" If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this."	Nuns?
What're you doing?	Even nuns have to pee.
Don't you have a concert to go to?	That depends.  Sisters, you don't know this, but Reverend Mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. That's bad news.  I don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?	I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.	Yeah, like what?
Hey, girls.	Hail, Mary.	Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.	Oh-huh.	People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.	Really.	But -- wait.
We could put you into our witness protection program.	A hiding place.
Then one day they find you.	They open a window.
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.	Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?	Where's who?	You won't even tell us?	I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
We're looking for Mike.	You found him -- but we're not open yet.
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.	Who are you guys?	We're the guys from Vegas.  You had Christy last night, but you let her get away.  It's upsetting.
But you didn't tell me!	We didn't tell you what?	That she's a nun!  That chick you're looking for -- she's a nun!
A nun?	I'm telling you!
Vince -- is she... okay?	Maybe.
And if she runs?	Take care of it.
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.	It's a bluff, Vince.	You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.
It's done?	Not... totally.	What's the problem?
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?	It didn't happen.
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.	Yeah...
Well?	It didn't work, Vince.	You were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
Right.	So, take it off.
I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.	Maybe pants.
Get her!	Which one!
There she is!	Which one?
I can't see anything in here!	Willy -- hit the lights.
Joey?	Where is she?
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.	She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?	Yeah, right -- when I see it.
She's gettin' away!	Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.	No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
You didn't shoot!	Neither did you!	I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.	That's what I figured, too.
Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?	For like, twelve zillion eternities?
A sweater.	And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
What's she doing?	She's praying.
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?	Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
It should be here any minute.	Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.	We're losing it.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.	That should have tipped us.
We've got to save her!	We can't leave it up to the Feds!
Yes, Mary Patrick?	Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
Sister Mary Patrick?	Yes?	I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence?
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?	Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.	Really...
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.	But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.	All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
Peace on Earth.	However, we can also pray for other things.	Measles.
Is this like your old convent?	Which convent was that, Sister?
Mary Clarence has a background in music. That's what Reverend Mother said.	Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!	That was exciting!
He's not like other guys.	He's decent.	He's kind.
I'd rather sing than do anything!	It's better than ice cream.	It's better than springtime.
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.	It's brought people back to the church.
Ice cream!	Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.	Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
Mary Clarence!  Sister!	It's no use.  She just isn't here.
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?	We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
You mean -- they kidnapped her?	Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
An... entertainer?	She wasn't a nun?
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!	She's our inspiration!
It's so beautiful...	And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!	But how do we get there?
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?	A Benedictine.
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!	Christy.
Not a note.	Impossible.
I don't understand.  Where is she?	Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?	She said they were from her old convent.	But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't have an old convent.
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.	But where?
Reverend Mother?	Yes?	Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?
Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but no.	We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.	And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.	We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.	Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.	But, Bishop...	St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.	I lied.	I know.
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.	And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.	She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?	It's that call you were expecting, Vince.	Can you hold?  Can you try?
She's a nun, Vince.	I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.	She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
She's... she's a nun.	Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
We both missed.	Okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
Where?	Find 'em!
If we could speak alone.	This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?	Many have.	Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
Who took the meat?	Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.	These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
Hail, Constable.  How are you?	Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?	Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.	How did you hear this?	He came to me.  He promised great violence.  Said I should cast you out for my own protection.  I must speak honestly.  There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.
Certainly not.	Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.	Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
What the hell are you doing?	You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?	Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
They spend two days in chains.	Two days... ?  For murder?
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.	I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.	You must have missed your mark.	I hit him square.	I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?	Excuse me?	I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?	I was afraid of this.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?	To place it inside its coffin.
No bleeding.	What is that?	This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
We must be a curious sight to him.	What are you spying on?	The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
He is a behemoth.	A diseased monster.
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.	I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.	In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.	... Brom Bones...	He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.	Bring Young Masbath here.	You need to sleep.	Bring him.	You need rest.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.	You will stay at her side?
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.	Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
Stains of blood.	What of it?
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.	What?	When this cut was made, this person was already dead.  This is not Lady Van Tassel.
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?	All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies...	The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
It is sacrilege!	I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
I will not allow it.  I will not!	Protest to my superiors if you like.	Your superiors are two days away!	Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?	Does that look like an animal hanging?
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.	No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.	Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.	Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.	It is only important what you are. An adulterer...	I am the Lord's voice in this town.	Wallowing in sin and lust...	They need guidance.	Wallowing quite literally in blood.	Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell!	He may.  But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.	You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!	Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God.
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.	Pardon me?
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?	When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
Do you have these persons' wills?	I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.	Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?	Hmm?  See them?	May we look at them now?	Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
Maybe you should take this.	A fine idea.
Damn... damn... damn...	Master Hardenbrook...
Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?	Well... that might be... helpful.
Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.	He drowned.  Anyone could see.	There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.	I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.	Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.	Have they nothing to fear presently?	Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.	And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.	But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
Very few, if any.	Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?	For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.	Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.	Chosen me?	"These ""methods"" of yours... there has been no practical application."	Not for lack of trying.	Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?	I shall, gladly.	Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning.
Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.	More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.	No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?	Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
The Widow Windsor.	Is that all you say?  Look at her.	It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.	The militia?
The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...	And now Jonathan Masbath.	Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?	He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?	Believe?
What is that you wear?	My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.	Well... so much for common sense.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.	Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.	I know it.
Listen to what you say....	No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...	At times I do.
I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice.	Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things.	I manage fine alone.	I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...	Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.	I did not ask you to, did I?
What is the common thread between these victims?	I'm sure I don't know.	We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.	How could he?	His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
Where are we going?	Up.
What is it?	It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
Out there.  What do you see?	The Western Woods.	Look again.
Are you familiar with magnets?	What kind of nuts?	Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here.
It's spectacular.	Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.	No, I couldn't...	I have others.  All I need is this.
Thank you.	Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.	Father said witches live there.	Witches do not exist.  However...
What is it?	Listen.	I hear nothing.	No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
We are leaving.	What happened?
Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead.  Maybe we passed it by.	"How could something named ""the tree of the dead"" fail to draw attention?"
We should not go much further in this murk.	Should we go back?	We are far from the Hollow.  Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?	"""Let loose his silent shrieking."" Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  ""He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand."" Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives."
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.	You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.	Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.	True enough.	Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?	Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
What is it?	Stay back.
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?	We should go.	Why this tree?
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.	Man or woman?	All I saw was their lantern.	Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?	Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
What good is this?	To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.	And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.	Yes.
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.	But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?	No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.	In test... what?	Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.	What does it mean?
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?	Baltus Van Tassel.	Did your father take a loan?	Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.	"There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  ""Paasch, James"" ""Pieter, Thomas"" ""Pos, William."""
I was getting worried.  Who was it?	Lady Van Tassel.	What was she doing?	Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?	No.  They are all missing.
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.	It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.	What books?	Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.	But, sir... what books?  Where are they?
What now?  Where is she?	Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir?	I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?	Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
Why... why are you like this?	You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
This is farewell.	Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.	I cannot.  You should not worry.  Van Ripper and his wife will look after you.  They will.  You will be well cared for.
Climb up!	Lady Van Tassel...	I know.  Hold on.
What can we do?	Take the reins.
What now?	I doubt that's the end.
How are you?	Tired.
Forgive me, I didn't know.	I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.	Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?	You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?	Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.	Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.	Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...	Other people?	Small talk.	It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?	Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.	My suitor?	"The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call ""friend,"" he misplaces a good portion of jealousy."	He has proposed to me twice.	"Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was ""no"" at least once."
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.	Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.	Are you so superstitious?	To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.	There is no such thing as magic.	Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?	Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.	You are funny.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?	May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?	You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.	I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
These scars.  How did you get them?	I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.	It would be interesting to find out.
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.	Yes, he does.  May I try?
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...	You made this, and the drawings?	Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.	Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?	If you want.  But...	Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
Thank you.  No.  Here...	I insist that you have it.	Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.	That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
You promised justice.	If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?	People have put their trust in you.	They have done nothing of the sort.	Won't they still have that justice?  Or, was it a vain promise?
Why would you do such a thing?	No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...	I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.	You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.	What are you on about?	The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.	Must I hear this?	There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.	And this gives worth to butchery?	It was not butchery.	What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?	I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.	Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?	To avenge his father, and the others.	But, why?  Tell me why.
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.	If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.	What troubles you?
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.	No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.	What has happened?
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.	What?	She is not your birth mother, is she?	No, but... why do you ask that?	What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?	She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?	Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.	If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?	I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
It is only me.	Katrina.  Why do you follow?	I apologize if I worried you.	A woman should not be out alone in these woods.	But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and...  To thank you.
Blood.	What did you say?
What are you doing?	Just... keep where you are.
My God... what has happened?	He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?	The skull is gone.	Yes.  I did notice that, thank you.
What... what are you doing... ?	I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
What is so urgent?	Come with me.
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.	It was you there?	When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.	And, what did he say?	He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...	What did he say, Katrina?	I have not been able to face him yet.	The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.	Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.	What would you have me believe?	If you think I am behind this, say it.	The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.	Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
Katrina...	Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
Where are we going?	I do not know.  Away.
The church.	He moves too fast.
What was that?	His horse.
Ichabod...	Keep climbing.  I will follow...
Quickly, close it.	No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.	I... I can't do this.	We have no choice.
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?	It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
Returning to the Western Woods?	Yes, actually.	Use caution.	Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.	As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo.  Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.	No.  She has gone out.	Where?	She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?	Very little.  I must be going...
It appears well.  It has already clotted.	Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?	It is fine.  Now, I must...
I know you saw me.	What... ?
You cannot kill what is already dead.	Let her go!	Yes... yes.  I think I will...
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?	I can show exactly.
Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible...	To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
There was not much blood, was there?	I didn't see none.
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!	What did you say?	Turn around.  Now!
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?	Yes.  Here...
Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?	You are from the Hollow?	In a way, yes.
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.	Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.	The Horseman.  Yes.	Sit.
Can you help?	You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
What... what are you doing?	Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.	Doctor, he is awake.
You... you are alive.	Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
He rides tonight.	Father saw you die.	He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.	No one will believe your lies, whore.	This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon.  But... I am not going to kill you.  Not me...
Go home.	May I see my mother?	You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.	She did not do it... please listen...	She is guilty.	No, sir, please... she is innocent...	She has confessed.	No.	She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.	Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.	Karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with.  Now there's one more thing. The way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out. You didn't want to go anywhere, did you?
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?	I can't remember.	"There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, ""Boy this water's cold."" Old boy from Arkansas says ""Yeah, and it's deep too.""  Get it? That's a goodun."	Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.	Well, yeah it's a classic. You know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin' you locked up. You need to come and go as you please. Here, take this key, it'll get you in and out that back door.  Them french fries good?
I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.	Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
Thank ye.	Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
They say you're a whiz on fixin' lawn mowers and things.	I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.	We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.	I like them french-fried potaters.	Yeah, me too.
I don't reckon.	If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
Yeah, they's good all right.	You got any money?	They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.	Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.	All right then.	I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.	That boy wants me to.	All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?	I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.	You done fixed it? I'll be damned. Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed. 'Course Scooter's about as shitless as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be. You done fixed it. I'll just be damned. See you tomorrow.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.	See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
Thank ye.	Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.	Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?	Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?	No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.	I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.	He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.	Well, I ain't scared of him workin' here. You know me. I'm a church goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your time's up the Lord's gonna come git you. You seared of him, Scooter?
That old man of his still livin' over there on Clark Street I believe.	He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?	Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'll take it out of your pocket anyway.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.	Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.	Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.	Good to know you, Karl.
How 'bout you, Jerry.	How are you, Bill?	Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?	Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.	Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.	Is him stayin' here workin' out?	He's gone to stayin' over with that Wheatley boy and his mama in their garage. I think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot. But he's got a key here to come and go as he pleases. Everything's worked out good.	Can I see him?	Sure.
I'll see you, Bill.	Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
Can I help you?	I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.	Well, what did you want?	You have any biscuits for sale?	Naw, we don't have biscuits.
Did you decide, sir?	What you got that's good to eat?	Well, I guess it's all good.	What do you like to eat here?	French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.	French-fried potaters.	Yeah.	How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.	Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.	Give me the big'uns.
These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.	What you got in there, warshing?	Yeah.	Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?	I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.	How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?	About a half a mile I think it is.	I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.	Okay. You don't have to though.
My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?	Karl's my name.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.	They was a boy. We made friends.	I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.	It's too big.	Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?	Don't say nothin' about that boy.
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.	Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?	Yeah.	I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.	We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?	You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.	Catch you later Freddy!
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.	I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?	He's just mentally retarded, I guess.	He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.	You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.	He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.	Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?	You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.	Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.	Frank, why don't you go off and play in your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.	See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.	I just feel sorry for the poor thing.	Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.	He does make some funny noises.
You know what, by God?	What?	You know what we ought to do tonight?	Please Doyle, don't.	Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.	Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.	You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low.
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.	No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.	Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done called him. He'll be here.  Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I need you to help me ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank.
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on!	Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.	But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.	This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.	You know better than to talk like that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make me knock the piss out of you.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.	You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.	That might be better than this.
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.	Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.	Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.	Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.	What do you want, hun?
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.	What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
How'd your baptizin' go?	It went real good.	Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?	Would y'all like that?
All right, y'all gonna go with me?	Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.	I'll be back in a little bit then.
Well, honey, I don't guess I give a shit. I ain't here half the time anyway. If you want a retard livin' in the garage, I don't guess I care. I've got a good tool box and socket set out there I don't want stol'd. I guess I could take it home with me.	He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.	Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?	No sir.	No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your mama. This is your mama's decision, not yours. I'm lettin' it go on because she asked me, not you.  Now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that, 'cause I have trouble eatin' around that kind of thing. Just like I am about antique furniture and midgets. I can't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture. Same thing with a droolin' retard.
I ain't sure.	You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
I want to watch T.V.	Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V. Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.	Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
Stop it, Doyle!	You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!	Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.	I get nervous, that's all I know.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.	That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.	I hate you!	Well, I hate you, too. No I don't. I love your mama. Nobody understands what I go through. I'll leave. You bunch of freaks have fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey. I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass, really.  You ever hit me again you little bastard and I'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?	Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
Sure, I guess.	Don't rush ever'body, honey.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.	I know Albert. We're friends.	I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.	That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
You like that Vaughan?	Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.	You enjoying yourself, Karl?
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.	Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.	Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?	Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.	Sarcastic right?  You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you.
You got that shit right.	What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
I don't really understand the meaning of the words.	If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.
We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!	It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.	I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.	That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.	I thought I told you to keep out!
What's in your bag?	This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.	What's all them books?	Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.	You believe in the Bible?	A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.	Well, I can't understand none of it. This one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another. Just how retarded are you?
I ain't never used no hatchet that I remember.	You're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then.  It wouldn't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause I ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm afraid for you to stay here. You're just a humped over retard it looks like to me. Not really, I'm just jokin' with you. Welcome to our humble home, buddy. Frank needs all the friends he can get. Frank's a real weak little kid. His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.
"On the bass, give it up for Terence ""One Ball"" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums ""The Johnson.""  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?"	Childers.	Karl Childers just in from the state facility. Make one of them gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it is you do.  Oh well, Karl's a little retarded, he don't know what the hell I'm talkin' about. And to Vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients. Now that takes balls. Our number one tune for the folks, boys. Kick it off Johnson!
I want to be baptized.	Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
Don't hit that boy no more.	You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.	How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?	Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.	What numbers do you punch?	I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.	I aim to kill you with it.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.	I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.	They're from the Dollar Store. I'm not an idiot. Besides we have a garden full of flowers.
I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.	Why? Hi, Karl.	He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...	Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.	Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.	But maybe just for awhile --	I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
What's you last name?	Childers.	What are all them books?	Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.	How come you're carryin' them around with you.	Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.	Don't you live somewhere?	I did live there in the state hospital.	Why'd you live there?	I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.	They let you out?	Yeah.	How come?	They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.	Are you well?	I reckon I feel all right.	You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
Do you like to play football?	I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.	Me and the Burnett twins and some boys plays down at the junior high practice field all the time. If you ever want to come by and play. We ain't no good either. Well, I'll see you later.
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?	Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.	Yeah. What you doin' by here?	You told me to come by.	Did you want to play ball with us?	I ain't no good at it. I just come by.	Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.	All right then.
Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.	I don't want to worry your mama with company.	Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.	I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?	They sell some of everything. Come on let's go. I won't tell her about you bein' in the state hospital for killin'.
This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?	Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.	They still around, your folks?	My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.	How do you know?	He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.	How did your mama die?	You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.	I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.	How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?	She says it's for the times when he's good to her. She's lonely since daddy died. She said sometimes she don't know why.  He threatened to kill her if she ever left him. My daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real good to mama. Vaughan that you met. But he's not able to do anything to Doyle, he's funny you know. Not funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes to go with men instead of women. That makes him not to be able to fight too good. He sure is nice though. He's from St. Louis. People who are queer can get along better in a big town. He got transferred here to work. But mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. For bein' the way he is. I wish he liked to go with women. I'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than Doyle.
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.	Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.	It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.	Why did he do that, reckon.	'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?	Yeah, I did.	Who did you kill?	Two people.	Were they bad people?	I thought they was.	Maybe they needed it.	I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.	It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.	You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.	Well, I hate him.	He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.	Will you stay here with us for a long time?	I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.	I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.	I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.	I like the way you talk.	I like the way you talk.
Hey Karl, you off work?	Yeah.	Where'd you get them flowers?	That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.	I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?	Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.	It's name's A Christmas Carol.	That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.	You want to go with me?	Yeah.
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.	All right then.	Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?	Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.	Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.	Hit was right thoughty of her.	I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.	All right then.	You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.	Yeah, I recollect it.	Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.	If you want me to.	I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.	I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.	I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?	They ort to. You're a good boy.	Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.	Naw.	And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.	That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?	What do you mean?	Pull on your works. Your privates.	Oh, jackin' off?	Yes sir. You ort not know that language.	I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?	You ort not to pull on yourself that away.	I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.	He ain't no count.	You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.	I don't reckon I know.	And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?	Naw.	'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?	I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.	Why not? It died?	Yeah.	Why?	Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.	So it died when it come out?	My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.	It was alive?	Yes sir. Right then it was.	A boy or girl?	A little ol' boy.	You threw it in a trash barrel?	I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.	It was still alive when you buried it?	I heared it cryin' a little through that box.	That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.	I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.	That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.	Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.	I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?	I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.	Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.	Yes sir, I reckon it does.
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?	I reckon.
What you readin'?	Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?	Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?	I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.	I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.	Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.	Is that right?	I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.	You will? For sure?	Yeah.	We'll be on teams, me and you?	Yessir.
Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.	I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.	We're liable to win if we keep this up. For somebody like you, you sure run fast.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.	Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.	You're strong though. You let me make them touchdowns so I'd feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing.
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?	No sir.	It was fun, anyhow.	I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.	Can we play ever' Saturday?	If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
Yeah, I guess.	Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?	I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?	Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.	I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.	You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.	You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.	Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.	That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.	Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.	I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.	I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.	Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.	You don't want to give away all your books.	I aim fer you to have 'em.	Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?	Yes sir.	I've got a feelin' today.	Reckon what kind of a feelin'?	Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?	Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?	You know I would. Whatever you want.	Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.	Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?	Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.	Okay.
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.	Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.	Nice to meet you, Karl.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.	Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?	Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
How come Karl won't eat here with us?	I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.	I'm glad of it, honey.
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.	They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.	He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.	He ain't ever okay to me.
You all right, Mama?	I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.	We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?	No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.	Did Vaughan go home?	Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.	Did Karl go to bed?	I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.	I bet he don't. Karl likes me.	I know he does.	Mama?	Huh?	Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.	Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.	Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?	I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.	I love you, too, Mama.
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.	He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.	I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.	We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.	Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.	I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
You walk fast, don't you?	I reckon.
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?	I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
A blister shore can hurt.	Yeah.	Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.	Me, too.
I'm ye boy.	I ain't got no boy.	I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.	I ain't got no boy.	They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well.
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.	I told you, I ain't got no boy, now get on out from here and let me be.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.	Yes, I guess you are.	I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.	You better go get your things.	I ain't got nothing but them books.	You better go get 'em.	All right then.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?	I want to come back and stay here.	Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.	I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.	Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?	Naw.	Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?	Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.	Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?	I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.	I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?	I reckon.	I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.	I never was no good with history.	No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.	I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere.
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.	He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
Karl, you up?	Yes sir.
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?	Yes sir.	Well, I guess we better hit the road.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?	Yes sir.	Do they know about you?	My history.	Yeah.	I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.	I'll be.	That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.	I knew you'd do all right. Well, I just wanted to check on you. I'll say bye to Bill and get on back.
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?	Tolerable, I reckon.	Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
You scared me.	I didn't aim to.	Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?	No ma'am.
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.	I'll be dog.
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?	Right now?	Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.	Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?	Yes ma'am.	Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.	Mustard's good on 'em to me.	Okay.
Thank ye.	It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?	I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.	"Vaughan's ""friend"" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm."	I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.
Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.	That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?	I killed my mother and a old boy name Jesse Dixon. I thought they was a-doin' wrong. I was about your boy's age. They say I'm well now from it.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?	Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.	I believe you. I really do.
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.	All right then.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?	I could shore use some. Thank ye.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?	No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.	Well, okay. I got you some.	Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.	Where'd he go? What's goin' on?	He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.	All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.	Ma'am?	Yeah.	You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.	Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.	You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.	We sure like havin' you.	Thank ye.  I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.
I don't think I've ever seen you before.	Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.	It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?	I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.	What brings you back?	What's that you say?	Why are you here now?	They turned me loose from the state hospital.	Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?	I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.	Do you have family here?	Not really to speak of.
Yes sir.	So, you're really going to stay here?	That boy wants me to.	Did you knock on the door yet?	Naw, I ain't.	How long have you been standing here?	Quite a spell, I reckon.	Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?	I done et just a little bit ago.	I mean tomorrow or the next day.	I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.	Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon.
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?	I reckon not.	Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.	Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.	Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?	I've heard it said that way.	Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?	I wouldn't never hurt them.	That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.	Oh. How about before that?	Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.	I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.	I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.	Okay.	This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.	What's wrong? Is everything okay?	That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?	Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?	Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?	I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?	Can I help you, sir?
He just got out of the state hospital.	I know.
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?	Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.	He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.	He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.	What about me?	I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.	Karl is a guy guy?
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.	Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.	Vaughan, don't get pushy.	I'm sorry.
Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.	That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.	In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?	Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.	Do you smell shit?	Yeah.
Let's just go, Marsha.	No, we have to get this story.	I thought you'd be happy to leave.	Why won't he talk to women?
My name's Jerry Woolridge.	Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.	Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?	Yes sir.	I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?	Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.	Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?	No thank you.	The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.	Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.	Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?	I knew he slept in a toolshed.	His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--	Before they were married?	"I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says ""Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1."" He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin."	That's really strange. What does it mean?	One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.	How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?	It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.	Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.	He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.	Signs?	Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.
Is he leaving right this minute?	We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.	I didn't mean that.	I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.	Where will he go?	Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.	Will he be supervised?	As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.	Why?	Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.	"You mean about y'all bein' together in ""that"" way?"	Yes.	I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.	Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
What!	Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?	No! At least I don't think I am!	Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?	An invitation?
And what's the occasion of this celebration?	It's my birthday.	And how many people will be attending this birthday party?	I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.	Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--	Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.	And what are you, his chaperone?	Actually, I'm his father.
Like me, too.	I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.	No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
Will that be cash or charge?	Better make it charge.	I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?	I confess.	I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works?
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?	Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.	And your father? Is he from New York?	Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.	Just like me.
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?	It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.	Your dissertation? What subject do you study?	American literature. What else?	What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?	Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.	Wow. You don't fool around, do you?	Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?	Melville, huh?  It's been a while.	That's the subject of my last chapter.	Not an easy book.	Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
Jesus, what happened to you?	It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.	What happened?	I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.	It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.	Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?	Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.	I'd love to.	Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.	I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?	Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?	Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.	Forty-one pages.
What'll it be, Auggie?	Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
And what about for you?	Huh?	What about for you?	For me?  I'll have the same thing.	Do me a favor, will you?	What's that, Sol?	"Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, ""Two corned beef sandwiches."" When you want two ginger ales, say, ""Two ginger ales."""	What's the difference?	It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.	"Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, ""One corned beef sandwich,"" and then, ""Another corned beef sandwich,"" I'll say, ""Two corned beef sandwiches."""	Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?	Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?	Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.	The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?	Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.	The Queen of England?	Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First.  Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.	I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
Are you closed?	You run out of Schimmelpennincks?	Do you think I could buy some before you leave?	No problem. It's not as though I'm rushing off to the opera or anything.
Looks like someone forgot a camera.	Yeah, I did.	It's yours?	It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.	I didn't know you took pictures.	I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.	So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.	That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.	How'd you get started?	Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.	A photographer ...	Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.	I'd like to see your pictures some day.	It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
They're all the same.	That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.	I've never seen anything like it.	It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.	Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?	I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.	It's kind of overwhelming.	You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.	What do you mean?	I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.	But they're all the same.	They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.	Slow down, huh?	Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.	It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
Hey, man, good to see you.	This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?	It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.	How old, kid?
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?	Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?	I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.	Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
The kid's sorry, Auggie.	Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.	He's got something to tell you, Auggie.	If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?	He's crazy.	No, he's not. You are.	You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.	It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.	Fuck you, kid.
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.	Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?	No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.	Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.	For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?	Not a peep.	I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.	That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.	Or didn't.  There's no way of knowing, is there?
So what did he say when he called?	Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?	It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.	We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Hey, man, how's it going?	Hi, Auggie.
Two, right?	Uh, better make it one.	You usually get two.	Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.	Ah-hah.
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.	That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.	Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?	Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.	Anything good?	Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.	It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.	Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy?
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?	You got it.
So. Are we ready?	Ready. Any time you are.	I'm all ears.	Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?	Every word.	Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
Did you ever go back to see her?	Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.	She probably died.	Yeah, probably.	Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.	I guess so. I never thought of it that way.	It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.	I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.	You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.	Anything for art, eh, Paul?	I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.	And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?	Yes, I suppose I do.
What do you mean?	I mean, it's a good story.	Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?	Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.	Eighteen and a half years.	Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.	You're looking good, Auggie.	No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?	I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.	And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?	You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.	At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.	I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.	Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.	This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.	You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got that?
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?	Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.	Like what?	Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.	Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?	Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.	Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.	Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.	Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?	"It means ""happiness."""	I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.	I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.	You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?	Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?	That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.	You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?	Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.	It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.	You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.	It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.	A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.	And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.	You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.	Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.	Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?	Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.	Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.	I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.	Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.	You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?	I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.	You don't give up, do you?	Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.	Where to?	Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
I told her she was going to meet her father.	You what?	It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.	I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.	Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.	Yeah, like what?	That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.	Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.	Wait till you see her, Auggie.	And what's that supposed to mean?	She looks just like you.	Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.	When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.	You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
So you're just going to give up and go home?	I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.	Still, you can't just write her off.	Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.	She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.	Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.	Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.	I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.	No you're not.	Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.	Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.	Bully for you.	No, bully for you.
What's this?	Why don't you open it and find out?	Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.	Five thousand bucks.	And you're giving it to me?	It's all yours, baby.	For keeps?	For keeps.	I can't believe it. Oh God, I can't believe it.  You're an angel, Auggie. An angel from heaven.
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.	I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
There's just one thing I want to know.	Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.	No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.	How long you been working for me, Auggie?	I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.	It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?	I don't know.  Maybe because I love you so much, boss.	Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.	I almost got married once.	Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.	Ruby McNutt. My one true love.	Sounds like another one of your stories to me.	She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.	Lovely.	She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.	You don't take anything seriously, do you?	I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.	I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.	Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.	They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.	Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.	Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?	It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.	No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.	It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?	Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.	They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.	I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.	Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
Seventeen.	Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?	Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.	Good. Keep it up, and maybe one day you'll grow up and become a great man like me.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.	Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.	Ten o'clock tomorrow morning. I'll be there.
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?	Sure thing. See you later.
A little. Not much.	This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
It's for you.	For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?	Open it.	What is this, some kind of joke?	No, it's five thousand dollars.	Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.	What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.	And why the hell would you give me money?	So I can get my job back.	Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?	To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.	You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.	What difference does it make?
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?	Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.	It'll never be finished.	Huh?	That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.	I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open?	When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!	Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.
... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?	Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.	Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.
Does it hurt?	Of course it hurts. What does it look like?	I thought maybe he was pretending.
They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...	And how much are these?	Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.	And these?	Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.	And these?	Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.	I think I'll take them.	A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.	The refrigerator?	It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.	Thanks for the tip.	"Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: ""A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke."	What does that mean?	Damned if I know. But it has a nice ring to it, don't it?
Is your name Paul Benjamin?	What can I do for you?	I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.	How the hell did you get into the building?	What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?	The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?	I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.	Thomas? Who's Thomas?	Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.	I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.	Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.	You mean Rashid?	Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?	Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.	And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?	Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!	I just want to know where he is.	As far as I know, he went back to his parents.	His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?	That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.	I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.	He doesn't go to the Trinity School?	He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.	And his parents?	His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.	I shouldn't have let him go.	Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?	I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.	He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.	Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?	No thank you.	Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?	Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.	And you told your nephew about it?	I figured he had a right to know.	And?	"And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, ""I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."""	Those are pretty hostile words.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.	You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?	Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.	Jesus.	Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.	It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.	No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.	And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?	Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.
You going to sit here all day?	I don't know. I haven't decided yet.	Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.	It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.	Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.	I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?	I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?	Just passing through.	Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.	I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.	It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.	It'll cost you five bucks.	Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?	Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.	Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?	I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.	Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?	Not a one.	Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.	It was just a thought.	Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.	What's your offer?	Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.	Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?	Benefits?	You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.	I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.	Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.	The name is Cyrus Cole.	Paul. Paul Benjamin.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.	"An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, ""Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."""	And have you mended them?	I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.	You named the kid after yourself, huh?	That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.	And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.	Hi there, little brother.	Say hi to Paul.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.	Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?	Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.	That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
Thomas.	Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?	Thomas.
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.	Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.	Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?	You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now!
Yeah? Who is it?	It's me, honey. It's Mom.
Well?	Well what?	Aren't you going to say anything?	What do you want me to say?	I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.	I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.	Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.	Baby? And what baby is that?	Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.	Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.	What are you talking about?	An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.	Yeah? And why is that?	Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.	Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.	They didn't have to do a thing, that's all I'm saying. The team was good, the best fucking team in baseball. But then they had to screw it up.  They traded their birthright for a mess of porridge.  A mess of porridge.
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.	I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.	I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?	Huh?	You still have that watch Auggie gave you?	Tick-tock, tick-tock.	So what's the time?	Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.	I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...	No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.	No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.	I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.	I owe you something.	It's okay, mister. No big deal.	Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.	Well, if you put it that way...	You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.	That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.	Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.	I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.	Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.	Rashid. Rashid Cole.
Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it? It might help to absorb some of that liquid. You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up.	That's okay. I've already had lunch.	You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.	I mean breakfast.	Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.	Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.	Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.	Well, maybe just one. To be polite.	Cocktail hour is over. The young man would like to order a hamburger.
Mostly what.	You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.	You don't know me from a hole in the wall.	That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?	Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.	And where do Momsie and Popsie live?	East Seventy-fourth Street.	In Manhattan?	Of course. Where else?	Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?	That's where the what comes in.	The what?	The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.	You can't be more specific than that?
Here and there. Around.	Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.	Yeah, that's right.	Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.	The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.	But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?	People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.	"I'm not ""people."" I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?"	Thanks, but I'll manage.	In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.	I can take care of myself. Don't worry.	Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address.
I didn't expect to see you again.	Same here. But I had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon. You know, to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture, and he said it would be okay.
That's it. Just the two rooms.	This is the first house I've been in without a TV.	I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.	But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.	I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?	Nice drawing. Did you do that?	My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.	Yeah, I can believe it.	It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.	Is your father an artist?	No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.	He's dead?	Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.	Drawing's a good thing.	Is that what you do? Draw pictures?	Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.	What time is it?	Eight-thirty.	Eight-thirty?	You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?	I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.	A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?	I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.	The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias.	Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?	If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise.  It might be worth it.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.	It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?	I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.	How long have you been here?	Three nights.	And how long did I tell you you could stay?	Two or three nights.	It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?	I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?	No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.	You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.	Are you going to be all right?	Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means.	Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?	Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man.	Take good care of yourself, okay?	You too. And make sure the light is green before you cross the street.  Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think you're a hell of a good writer.
Hey, it's you.	I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.	Appreciation for what?	I don't know. For helping me out.	Where did you get that thing?	I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work.	Where the hell do you think you're going?	Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.	Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.	I don't have much time.	Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.	You don't really want to know.	I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?	Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.	And?	I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.	So that's the something you weren't supposed to see, huh?
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.	Why don't you go to the police?	You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?	If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.	The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.	What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.	It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.	It looks like they've met in this apartment.	That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.	Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.	Let's not get too idealistic.	Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
Ah, coffee. Smells good.	One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.	Thanks.	What time did you get to bed last night?	I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.	You work too hard, you know that?	Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.	Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.	If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.	That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?	If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.	Come on, just a little hint.	Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.	The inspiration.	Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?	No way.	All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.	The end.	No, not the end. The beginning.  His son was just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just as he's unwrapping his cheese sandwich, he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice -- right there at his feet. He bends down to take a closer look, and suddenly he feels that he's looking into a mirror, that he's looking at himself. There he is -- dead -- and the body is perfectly intact, sealed away in a block of ice -- like someone preserved in suspended animation. He gets down on all fours, looks right into the dead man's face, and realizes that he's looking at his father.
Celebrate? What for?	It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.	Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?	I just did.	I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.	Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.	Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?	Absolutely. We would be honored.
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.	His only copy?	His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.	Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?	You don't believe me, huh?  Look, I'll show you. It's all in this book.
I don't know.	Is it yours?	Yeah, it might be.	Here, catch.
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.	Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.	Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.	Yeah, I picked it up.	And started to run.	And started to run.	Good thinking.	That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.	You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?	Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.	So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.	That's it. In a nutshell.	Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.	No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.	A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.	That money is my whole future.	Keep up with that attitude, and you won't have a future.  Seventeen is a hell of an age to die. Is that what you want?
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?	It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.	Well?	It wasn't my fault.	If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.	The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?	I suppose so. He never told me about it.	No wonder he was angry.	He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.	What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.	I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.	I'm not going to do it.	You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.	I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.	Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.	Good. I'm glad that's settled!
Hi, kid.	Wow. They sure did a job on you.	Research. I worked the scene right into my story.  That makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.	It's all right. I really do know them.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?	I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.	Now ask him who his mother was.
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.	Hot coffee or iced coffee?	Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?	Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?	If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living.	I don't mean to pry, but I see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back, and I begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions aren't stowed in there. Are you in some kind of trouble or what?
How do you want that cooked?	Medium rare, please.	Fries?	Yes, please.	Lettuce and tomato?	Yes, please.	You want another one of these, too?
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...	Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.	What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...	...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.	Oh, yeh?	Hid it from my mom.  Caught a mess a sea runs.  Damn thing's still in my closet.
$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that.	Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down?  Just bein' curious, is all.
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.	Carl Heine's type.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.	No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.	And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.	That's obvious.	You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff.  Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?	No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?	None.	Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...	I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was asked only t...
I don't know.	You don't.
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...	I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.	...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.	So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.	They fished t'gether.  Went to school. Carl Junior treated him like a white person.  Like any friend.
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?	Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...	Why?  If they could never take title.	Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.	In the war.  Europe, I believe. They could hardly send him to the Pacific, could they?
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.	Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?	Well.  Every time I see him in town or somewhere, he's starin' at me with these narrow eyes. Givin' me his mean face.	When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?	That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.	Did he see some <u>danger</u> from defen...
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?	Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.	Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?	A thousand.	So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.	Is that your third question?	It is.	You done your math right.
Now, Mister Gi...	Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?	It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.	I'm sorry about that.  It wasn't mine in the first place.
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?	Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...	No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.	Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?	Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.	All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?	Well, what if?	Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in <u>advance</u>?  That Carl loses two batteries.  Must happen once ever' 20 years or so.
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.	Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.	You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?	Happy for him.  And relieved.	So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.	Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?	Closer to eight.	So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?	Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.	And then, something did.  Carl Heine was found dead.  With his head crushed.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.	Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
We discussed that.  And decided not to.	Why not?
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.	But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.	So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.	We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.	Well, it seems to me...
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.	It seems human.  To me.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.	You're implying th...	I said.  No further questions.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.	At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.	Easy.  Slow is best.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.	Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.	We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
My mom.  Would be the problem.	Why?  We're only talking.
I can just feel my spirits soar.	Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...	I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...	It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...	Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...	I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.	I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...	The Japs did it.
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...	There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.	Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
Did you write that column?	I did.  But the jury won't s...	It's not for the.  They only get to convict him.
You don't believe in God anymore.	Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.	You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.	Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.	Those aren't the facts that matter.
Your father fought at Belleau Wood, it took him years to get over it.  Nightmares, tears, b...	...but he found you.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.	And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.	It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.	So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?	More than eager.  He was out to make a point.
Well, what then, sergeant?	What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?	Oh, in a heartbeat.
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.	Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.	These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.	And the next one...?	From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.	And the last...?	Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?	You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.	And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?	Pretty darn clear.
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.	He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
Did you say more?	I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.	And why.  Is that?
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.	Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?	Japanese stick-fighting.  They're trained as kids, y'know.  To kill with sticks.
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?	Objection, asking the witness to speculate.	My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.	All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...	Objection!
Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is speculation.  Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.	Tht was summation, Your H...
Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.	Objection!  Speculation.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.	I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...	Twelve.
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?	My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.	But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.	Oh, yes.
Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.	Like you couldn't believe.
Greedy.	He didn't want to lose any more.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...	That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.	That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.	<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?	No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
Robbed.  He was angry.	Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?	Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.	And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?	Carl Heine came.
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.	He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
As my wife testified, we were considering it.	Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...	But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
Yes.  Initially.	Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.	Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?	I have told the truth.	You mean, this morning.  The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth?  That's a question, sir.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.	I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.	Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.	Yes.
Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries in your well.  If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?	I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
You have the night watch?  On the radio.	Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.	Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
How long you have this detail?	Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
You mean, early morning the 16th?	No, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  We replaced two guys named Miller and Milholland.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.	Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
I did.  Boy.	Three kids.  What's she going to do?
You said three minutes.	Won't take two.
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.	It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?	Have a look.  At nothing.
You gonna climb that with one arm?	You're right.  I better use two.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...	Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
It's the way it happened, I know it is.	No, you don't.
This tastes horrible, hmmn?	You're wondering why I held it.	I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones.  in the middle of the night.
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.	Yes, he was.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.	To my father.  Everything counts.
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.	Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.	That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.	Well, why does it?	Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
That's when he fell.	Fell.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...	Still lashed to the mast.	He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.	Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?	Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...	Maybe...?	Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.	But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.	Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?	The knife.  What knife?
Still a coincidence.  Timing and all.	The freighter started through at 1:42.  The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...	He hit his head.  On the way in.
You think so?	The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.	Well, anything coulda caused that.
Cigarette?	I'll take two.  One for later.
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.	You ever been strangled by a single hand?	Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
We don't let go, you s...	It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
What for, Sheriff?	We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
You always run with the well open?	I was checking the cables.
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.	Naw, I had that around for a while.	Sure you did.  Help me with this hold cover, willya?
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.	Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...	Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
What makes you think I play?	Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
White or black?	You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
You must think I like losing.	I think you like learning.
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.	Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
You wouldn't even see it move.	You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...	Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.	I should show them an American?
And what's that?	That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.	You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
You want me to say that.	I want you.  To tell the truth.
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.	I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.	And what do you believe?
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.	Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.	Maybe.
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...	Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.	And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?	Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.	Does it now?	A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.	You have to wonder.
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?	It is.	Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.	He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.	But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?	It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?	Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.	No spare.	No.	So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?	Apparently.	I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
I believe so.	Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?	I don't think so.	You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.	He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.	You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?	Possible.  But not darn likely.
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?	She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.	And her farmhouse...?	The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.	Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.	What else could it be?	Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.	<u>You</u> said that.  That was <u>your</u> testimony.
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?	As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.	Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.	Well...	Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?	Obviously.	Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.	The same.	So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...	If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.	Is it possible?	Sure, anything's poss...	Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.	I already said that, b...	<u>And</u> that you can't say for <u>certain</u> whether the head injury was sustained before or <u>after</u> death?
For certain, no.	But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.	For the third time, yes.
Can I say something, here?	Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?	Absolutely not.  Probably one or two hours.  Four at the most.
Are you absol...	<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...	I wouldn't say encouraged.	Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.	Not in those words.	So the defendant was encouraged to hope.  Or could have been.
I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.	Carl never lied.	Of course not.  But it was emotional.  A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude.
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?	He had no reason to.	Carl ever say <u>he</u> got one?	I can't speak for him.	You can speak for what he <u>said</u>. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...	Carl said he didn't like Kabuo much anymore.
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...	That's all he said.
Improved...how?	As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.	Mmmmmm.  Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...
"...He used to say, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."""	I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...	"Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these ""hot shots"" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?"	That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.	The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...	Such as?	Maybe we could run some tests.  Kind of a comparison, the old and the new...
"Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a ""platform"" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a ""platform"" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?"	"Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean ""AQ""...""aggressive qualities""?"	"Whatever the latest jargon is.                                   MEKUM Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.

Are these your bags?	Yes.  And that one, too.	Okay, doll.	I suppose you want a tip?	Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.	Bye.	Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?	Why?	Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -	Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?	Wanna see my driver's license?	Get lost, will you?	That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy.  And get rid of your roommate.
Which of you dolls is Daphne?	Bull fiddle.
It's from Satchel Mouth at Table Seven.  This is from me to you, doll.	Beat it, Buster.	Never mind leaving your door open - I got a passkey.
Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.	Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.
Hi, Mary Lou - Rosella - Okay, Dolores, get a move on - How's your back, Olga?	Clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
Yes, Sue?  What is it?	I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.	All right, girls.  Who does this belong to?  Come on, now.  Speak up.  Sugar, I warned you!
I beg your pardon.	All right, girls - from the top again.
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.	Funny?  In what way?	I don't know - but I can feel it right here.  That's one good thing about ulcers - it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.	Thank you ever so.	You're welcome.	It's entirely mutual.
Upsy-daisy.	Fresh!
No --- how does it go?	Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory.
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?	
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?	A what?	My suitcase - with all my resort clothes.
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?	It's private.  Go away.
Okay.	Manhattans?  This time of night?
- so the one-legged jockey said -	What did he say?	The one-legged jockey said - 'Don't worry about me, baby.  I ride side-saddle.'
Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!	Hey, she's ticklish!
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.	Stop, or I'll burst out crying.	He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.	Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.	Those two musicians from the garage!	They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago - so we'll finish the job here.  Come on.
What happened?	Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.	Where were you guys?
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?	I'll say.	I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?	Yeah.  Why?
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.	Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?	It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -	How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -	You're right, Joe.	Of course I am.	First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.	No we're not.	We're not?	First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.	You're going to bet my money on a dog?	He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -	What are you giving me with the rabbit?	Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.	But suppose he loses?	What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.	But suppose it doesn't?	Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?	Hey, Joe!	Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?	Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.	Quiet - I'm thinking.	Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -	Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?	Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!	I told you - it's a sure thing.	But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.	Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!	I thought you weren't talking to me.	Look at the bull fiddle - it's dressed warmer than I am.
Yeah - where were you?	With you.	With me?	Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -	It did?  Boy, did it ever!	So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?	Right.  We have the same blood type...	- Type O.
Nellie told us about it.	We're not too late, are we?
You mean it's a girls' band?	Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.	But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -	You've flipped your wig!	Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -	Josephine and Geraldine!  Come on!
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?	It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?	I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...	Knock it off, will you?
We didn't see anything -  - did we?	No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
I think they got me.	They got the bull-fiddle.	You don't see any blood?	Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
Where are we running, Joe?	As far away as possible.	That's not far enough.  You don't know those guys!  But they know us.  Every hood in Chicago will be looking for us -
You going to call the police?	The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.	We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.	We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.	Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?	Shave our legs, stupid.
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?	Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.	Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.	I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.	With those legs?  Are you crazy?
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.	The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.	What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.	This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
My name is Josephine.	And I'm Daphne.
DAPHNE?	I never did like the name Geraldine.
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.	I'm Josephine.  Sax.
How about that talent?  This is like falling into a tub of butter.	Watch it, Daphne!	When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -	Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
Not there - that's the emergency brake.	Now you've done it!	Done what?	Tore off one of my chests.	You'd better go fix it.	You better come help me.
This way, Daphne.	Now you tore the other one.
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.	Polish?
Bye, Sugar.  We been playing with the wrong bands.	Down, Daphne!	How about the shape of that liquor cabinet?
Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...	Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.	Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!	You tore it again!
Men?	Oh, you don't have to worry about that.	We would be caught dead with men.  Those rough, hairy beasts with eight hands -  They all want just one thing from a girl.
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.	I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
What are you doing?	I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.	But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?	Fight it.	But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?	Then pull the emergency brake!
Good night, Daphne.	Good night, Josephine.
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -	It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.	Break it up, girls!  Daphne! Come on, help me!
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!	You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
What happened?	I got pinched in the elevator.	Well, now you know how the other half lives.	And I'm not even pretty.	They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.	I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.	Blow where?	You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.	How can we?  We're broke.	We can get a job with another band. A male band.	Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.	But this is so humiliating.	So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?	All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?	What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -	What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.	Me?  After Sugar?	I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -	What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.	Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.	Don't get burned, Daphne.
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?	You - you -	This happens to me all the time in public.
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.	Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.	Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
You know - the old shell game.	Daphne, you're bothering us.
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -	And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?	Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message.	What message?  What motorboat?	You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -	Oh, he does!	Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.	Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.	Of course, you're not.  I'm going.	You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?	No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.	And where's he going to be?	He's going to be ashore with you.	With ME?	That's right.	Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!
Daphne - your boy friend is waving at you.	You can both go take a flying jump.	Remember - he's your date for tonight. So smile.
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.	Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?	Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.	Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?	Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.	Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
What are you doing with my flowers?	I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?	Have I got things to tell you!	What happened?	I'm engaged.	Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?	I am.	WHAT?	Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.	What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.	You think he's too old for me?	Jerry!  You can't be serious!	Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!	But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?	Security.	Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.	Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.	I'll say there is!	His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.	Jerry - there's another problem.	Like what?	Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?	We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.	You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?	Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.	Like when?	Like right after the ceremony.	Oh.	Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -	Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!	But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!	Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!	I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?	What engagement present?
Hey - these are real diamonds.	Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.	Wait a minute - lets not be hasty. After all, we don't want to hurt poor Osgood's feelings.
That's some nerve!	Daphne got a proposal tonight.
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.	Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.	So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.	What are you giving me with the omelette?	Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.	Joe -	What?
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.	Shut up and keep packing.	Okay, Joe.
Not that, you idiot.	But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?	There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.	Sugar?	Get me Room 414.	What do you think you're doing?
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?	We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.	Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.	That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.	Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -	Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.	I may throw up.
I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.	Yeah - lets shove off.
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?	What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.	All right. What happened to our bracelet?	Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.	What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.	No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?	We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.	There you go with that we again.
All right - so what do we do now?	First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
Did you hear that?	Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
What'll I tell him?	Tell him you're going to elope with him.	Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -	There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -	We're not on the pier yet -
OH!	Terribly sorry.	That's all right.  I was afraid it was Sweet Sue. You won't tell anybody, will you?
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.	I'm Sugar Cane.
She sings, too.	I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
We'll take a rain check.	I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
Are my seams straight?	I'll say.	See you around, girls.
Good night, Sugar.	Good night, honey.	Honey - she called me honey.
Oh - Sugar!	I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.	It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.	If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.	It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -	If there's anything I can do for you -	Oh, I can think of a million things -
And that's one of them.	Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.	We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.	I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.	Stay as long as you'd like.	I'm not crowding you, am I?	No.  It's nice and cozy.	When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.	Interesting.	Anything wrong?	No, no.	Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.	That's ridiculous.	And your head is hot.	That's ridiculous.	And you've got cold feet.	Isn't that ridiculous?	Let me warm them a little.  There - isn't that better?
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -	What did you say?	I'm a very sick girl.	Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.	I'm not that sick.	I have a very low resistance.	Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.	You got some?	I know where to get some.  Don't move.
You all right?	I'm fine.	How's the bottle?	Half-full.
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.	You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.	No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.	I may spill something.	So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.	What's the surprise?	Uh-uh.  Not yet.	When?	We better have a drink first.	Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.	No fair guessing.
Who needs vermouth?	We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
And bring the cocktail shaker.	Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
Not you, Sugar.	I'm just going to get some ice.
I'll carry the instruments.	Thank you, Daphne.
Here you are, Sugar.	A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?	You betcha.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?	We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.	She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
What do you think you're doing?	Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.	You should have seen me before I went on a diet.	I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -	That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.	But there's one thing I envy you for.	What's that?	You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.	Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.	Okay.
I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.	Vanity Fair?
His yacht?	It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.	I'm a what?	Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.	Come on, Daphne.
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?	Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.	Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.	If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.	Yeah - Josephine.	Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -	Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
We don't have to run.	Oh yes, we do!
Josephine -	I guess she's not in here.	That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.	Well, I'll come back later.	No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.	Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.	Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.	Do you suppose she went out shopping?	That's it.  Something tells me she's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.	I met one of them.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.	I hope so.	What do you think, Josephine?  What does it say in your crystal ball?
No!	Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.	No!	Yes.
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.	I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
Did he get fresh?	Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.	What for?	And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
How did you get that bracelet?	You like it?	I always did.	Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -	Thirty-four.	He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.	That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
Brand new.	This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
Where did you girls play before?	Oh - here and there - and around.
How did those holes get there?	Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?	Yes.  For a whole year.	I thought you said three years.
I was it.	What's the big idea?	I'm sorry. I was having a nightmare.  Something I ate.  I'm not at all well.  See?  Hot water bottle.
It's about the Florida job.	The Florida job?
What's wrong with us?	You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
We could pass for that.	- you got to be blonde -	We could dye our hair.	- and you got to be girls.	We could -
Yes, I'm holding on.	Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!	What's with him - he drinks?
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?	Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
Just a moment, miss -  May I?	Help yourself.	I am Osgood Fielding the Third.	I am Cinderella the Second.
If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.	Me too.  Bye now.	Let me carry one of the instruments.	Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.	Personally, I'm Type O.	You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.	You don't say.	Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.	You invest in shows?	No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.	You're not sure?	Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me	I'm not surprised.	So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.	Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?	Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.	Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?	Bull fiddle.	Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?	Most of the time I slap it.	You must be quite a girl.	Wanna bet?	My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.	Why?	She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.	Goodbye?	This is where I get off.	Oh, you don't get off that easy.
Please.  It won't happen again.	No, thank you.  I'll walk.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -	I'll throw up!	Well, then, why don't we go dancing? I know a little road-house, down the coast -
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.	Who?	About that roadhouse -	They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?	You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!	You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
Daphne...	Yes, Osgood?	You're leading again.	Sorry.
This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.	Pleased to meet you.	Come one!
Another bridesmaid?	Flower girl.
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.	Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.	We can have it altered.	Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.	Why not?	Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.	It doesn't matter.	And I smoke. I smoke all the time.	I don't care.	And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.	I forgive you.	And I can never have children.	We'll adopt some.	But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!	Well - nobody's perfect.
This is her roommate.  Daphne can't talk right now.  Is it anything urgent?	Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.	Got it.  Supper - yacht - after the show - I'll tell her.  Your yacht?
The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.	Just the two of you?  What about the crew?	Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -	That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?	We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.	Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?	To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.	You ain't going nowhere.
I don't like no witnesses.	We won't breathe a word.	You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.
I don't mean to be forward - but ain't I had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before?	Oh, no!
Anything today?	Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -	Thank you.
Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.	What a heel!  I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?
Oh?	Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.	You're making it up pretty good so far.	The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
What's the job?	It's three weeks in Florida -
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?	Why?	Because I got some plans -	I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -	And you'll be in all evening?	Yes, Joe.	Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.	My car?  Why, you -
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?	Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.	You need a bass and a sax, don't you?	The instruments are right, but you are not.  I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?	It's not the backs that worry me.	What kind of band is this, anyway?	You got to be under twenty-five -
No, we couldn't!	William Morris!
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.	We'll take it!	You got it.  It's six dollars a man.  Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock -
Well, here we are.	You two from the Poliakoff Agency?	Yes, we're the new girls.
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?	No - funerals.	Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
We got it second-hand.	All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
We got time off for good behavior.	There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
Tell what?	If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.	Where did he conduct?	On the Baltimore and Ohio.	Oh.	I play the ukulele.  And I sing too.
Running away?  From what?	Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
We understand.	All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Put it here.	Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.	Better keep a lookout.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?	I'm not very bright, I guess.	I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.	No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.	Then why did you take this job?	I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.	Afford it?	Have you ever been with a male band?	Me?	That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!	Rough?	I'll say.	You can't trust those guys.	I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!	Bingo?	You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.	Really?	"Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of ""Come to Me My Melancholy Baby"" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them."	That so?	Every time!	You know - I play tenor sax.	But you're a girl, thank goodness.	Yeah.	That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.	Yeah.	You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -	You don't say?	Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.	Men!	So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.	Brains aren't everything.	I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?	You are?	That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.	About what?	About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.	What's in Florida?	Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.	Going to catch yourself a rich bird?	Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.	You're entitled.	Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.	Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -	I want mine to wear glasses.	Glasses?	Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?	Well, now that you've mentioned it -	They get those weak eyes from reading - you know, all those long columns of tiny figures in the Wall Street Journal.
Happy days.	I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
What's happened?	Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.	I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.	Why not?	Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?	Want to switch berths with me?	Would you mind terribly?	Not at all.
Thanks, honey.	Good night, Sugar.
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.	I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.	Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.	So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.	Saxophone player?	What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.	Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.	What makes you so sure?	Just my feminine intuition.
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.	She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.	My fault.	You're not hurt, are you?	I don't think so.	I wish you'd make sure.	Why?	Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.	Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.	Thank you.	Who are you?	Now, really -
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?	Not very likely.	Are you staying at the hotel?	Not at all.	Your face is familiar.	Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -	That must be it.	Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.	Your view of what?	They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.	You have a yacht?
Which one is yours - the big one?	Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.	I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?	No, my flag steward.	And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?	No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -	I'm not interested at all.	Well, I'm not.	That's very interesting.
How's the stock market?	Up, up, up.	I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.	Could be.  Do you play the market?	No - the ukulele.  And I sing.	For your own amusement?	Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.	You're society girls?	Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.	Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?	Yeah.  Real hot.	Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.	So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.	Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?	They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -	- Inauguration balls -	- opening of the Opera -	- riding to hounds -	- and always the same Four Hundred.	You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.	You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -	I beg your pardon?	You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.	What theory?	Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?	Tonight?	I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.	I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.	Why?	I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.	Oh?	It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.	You collect shells?	Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.	Shell Oil?	Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
Would you mind moving along, please?	Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
Well, I guess I'd better go -	It's been delightful meeting you both.	And you will come to hear us tonight?	If it's at all possible -
Josephine.	Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
The most wonderful thing happened -	What?	Guess!	They repealed Prohibition?
One of whom?	Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.	You don't say!
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.	Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.	Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.	Shells?  Whatever for?
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.	I am?	Because he said he's coming to hear us play - maybe.
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?	Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.	For me?  It's Shell Oil.
You heard her - yes.	Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -
Been waiting long?	It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.	I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.	It's the thought that counts.
I seem to be out of gas.	It's sort of funny - you being out of gas - I mean, Shell Oil and everything -
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.	Looks like they're on the wrong track.	Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -	It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.	Just regulation size.  We have three like this.	Three?	Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.	My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?	Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?	Love it.  Which way?	Yes - now let's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up?
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.	Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
Oh - in here.	Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.	It's all right for a bachelor.	What a beautiful fish.	Caught him off Cape Hatteras.	What is it?	Oh - a member of the herring family.	A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?	They shrink when they're marinated.
Champagne?	I don't mind if I do.	Down the hatch - as we say at sea.	Bon voyage.
Look at all that silverware.	Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...	Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?	I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.	Where's your shell collection?	Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.	What's on Thursdays?	It's the crews' night off.	You mean we're alone on the boat?	Completely.	You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.	Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.	It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.	You're flattering me.	Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.	Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.	Harmless - how?	Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.	What thing?	They just sort of leave me cold.	You mean - like frigid?	It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.	Have you tried?	Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
See?  Nothing.	Nothing at all?	Complete washout.	That makes me feel just awful.	Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.	You mean you can't fall in love?	Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?	What happened?	I don't want to bore you.	Oh, you couldn't possibly.	Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -	Oh, no!	Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.	Talk about sad.	Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.	You poor, poor boy.	Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?	How can you think about food at a time like this?	What else is there for me?	Is it that hopeless?	My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!	Have you ever tried American girls?	Why?
Is that anything?	Thanks just the same.
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...	I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.	Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -	If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
Would you do me a favor?	What is it?	I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?	All right - if you insist.
Anything this time?	I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.	Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?	Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax.	It's like smoking without inhaling.	So inhale!
Well - ?	I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.
I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.	Lets throw another log on the fire.
I think you're on the right track.	I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
I never knew it could be like this.	Thank you.	They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.	Mineral baths - now really!	Where did you learn to kiss like that?	Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
Good night.	Good morning.	How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?	Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.	Let's make it an even million.
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.	Did you have a nice time?	Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.
Gee, I wish I'd been there.	I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
Really?	From a rich millionaire.	That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.	Me?	Daphne has a beau - I have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you.
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.	Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...	I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.	I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.	Tomorrow night?	Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.	Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.	You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.	A merger?  How long will you be gone?	Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.	You're not?	It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -	Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?	According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -	Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.	I knew you would.
I only wish there were something I could do for you.	But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.	Smart move.  Oh, by the way - did you get my flowers? You know, those orchids from my greenhouse - the fog finally lifted over Long Island, and they flew them down this morning.
Yes, they're here.  Oh - white orchids.  Would you believe it - I haven't had white orchids since I was a debutante.  What's this?	What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.	Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?	Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.	I didn't do anything.  It just happened.
Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.	Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.	Goodbye, my darling.
What's the matter, Sugar?	I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
Daphne -	He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.	You'll forget him, Sugar.	How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?	I told you - I'm not very bright.
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -	I know.  Every time!	Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -	That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
Good evening, sir.	I come to the old lady's funeral.	I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.	That's because I've been on the wagon.	PLEASE!	Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.	Show the gentleman to the chapel - pew number three.
What'll it be, sir?	Booze.	Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.	Coffee?	Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...	Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?	Sorry, sir.  That's reserved for members of the immediate family.
Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.	Who's going to raid a funeral?	Some people got no respect for the dead.
Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.	Go where?	A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.	I never join nothin'.	You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!	Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?	Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.	Me?  I'm just a customer here.	Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.	Mozarella?  Never heard of him.	We got different information.	From who?  Toothpick Charlie, maybe?	Toothpick Charlie?  Never heard of him.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.	If you want to, you can call your lawyer.	These are my lawyers - all Harvard men.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.	Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?	I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.	Big joke!	Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?	Me?  I was at Rigoletto.	What's his first name?  And where does he live?	That's an opera, you ignoramus.	Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?	Clark Street?  Never heard of it.	Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?	Why?	Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.	I cut myself shaving.	You shave with your spats on?	I sleep with my spats on.	Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.	You and who else?	Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.	You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
All right, Charlie - this the joint?	Yes, sir.	And who runs it?	I already told you.	Refresh my memory.	Spats Colombo.	That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?	I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.	Thanks, Charlie.	If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.	Okay, Charlie.
Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.	Goodbye, Charlie.
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.	Why wouldn't I?	We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.	Well, we all got to go sometime.	Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.	What for?	Orders from Little Bonaparte.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.	What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?	Just dropped in to pay my respects.	You don't owe me no nothing.	Oh, I wouldn't say that.  You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
I don't know what you're talking about.	So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.	Honest, Spats.  I had nothing to do with it.
Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!	No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!
You know what I love about all this?	Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?	Exactly! Todays my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
Perfect. All ginny.	Except its Scotch.	But Im not taking your name, buster. Im a feminist!  I need icey! Mr. husband-man, get me more icey!
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?	Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
Christ, Amy.	Oh, shut up and be happy. Its always this or that. Youre never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.	Drunk isnt the same thing as happy, Amy.
Why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole?	Bacardi 151.
I dont think I can go through with this.	Pub Golf?	The wedding.  I am so, so bad! I dont think I should be allowed to get married.
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--	When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.	But I do. I will. Youre my sister.
God, Kat! Please. Dont be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.	What? Why? What do you mean?
I should get going.	Are you sure youre okay?	Im fine. I promise.
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.	So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.	You practically bribed him with your erector set.
Hey.	Hey.
You know what? Im not having this conversation right now.	Sure, disappear. Weve been walking away our whole lives.
Wow. You look beautiful.	Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, youre my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because youve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldnt outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesnt feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I dont know, but your misery just isnt working for me anymore.
Fred Astaire and whats her face!	Its not me. I swear. Its her. Shes magic.
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.	What for?	To make sure youre okay.
You know all that if these walls could talk stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?	Actually, I do.
It was such a long time ago.	Still--	If Ed ever found out....	Or Kat....	And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.	Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.	Your probably best off pretending youre asleep.
Say something. Please.	I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Does Kat know?	Jeffrey told her last night.	Last night?
Wheres Nick sleeping?	Why, with you.	My mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks its--
Huh?	Im not as square as my daughter thinks.
Moms refining her strategy for DDay.	Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.	Sir, yes, sir!
Id be happy to. Youre welcome.	Oh, dont be that way.
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!	Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.	Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.	It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they havent made up since.
Im an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I dont bake.	So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
Whats going on with you two?	I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.	Theres a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.	Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.	Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.	Mom, please.	Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.	She did?	So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave?  You and Amy. Reunited.
Whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?	Um, just about everyone.	You are taking the piss?
Just because some slags been paid for, doesnt mean youve got to...you know.	Its been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
I think I love you, mate.  How do you know so much about so much?	Im a hooker.
I thought you said you were crap.	I had to say something to get you here.	Fair enough, but Im stepping on toes here and youre waltzing around like...
Ill just check into a hotel.	Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
I look like a total wanker, dont I?	Yeah, kind of.
You heading to the train station?	I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.	Yeah.
Whats his problem?	What?	Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.	Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?	No, thats not it.
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.	No.	It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.	Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.	And Kat was fully clothed.	But, somehow, it was Kats arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.	Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.	Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.	Lasik surgeon, actually.
I didnt deserve her back then.	And you do now?
Nothing.	Doesnt look like nothing.
Hey.	Oh, hello.
Ah, a philosopher.	Shrink, actually.	Crikey.	What?	Nothing, nothing.	No, tell me.	You Yanks and your therapy. Its great.  Its all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
Hey, man.	Sorry, can you give us a moment?	No, I cant. Were late for a dance lesson. I guess youll have to finish up later.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.	Hello, Katmandu.
Seeing you again....	Yeah?
Hey, Kat.	Hey, yourself.  I see youve met my ex.
Hey, you!	Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.	Maybe not her least... Theres always--
So, tell me, hows unmarried life?	I have regrets.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, were the past. Im not sure if you noticed, but Im here with someone else.	Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.	Its called character. God, youre predictable.	Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
Kat, wait. I dont want you hating me. Weve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.	Um, news flash: I dont give a shit.	Kat, stop it. You do. You cant even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.
That was a long time ago.	It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.	So, whats your point?	I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?	Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.	Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?	Not for a dog.	Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
Is this supposed to be an apology?	Its not supposed to be anything, Kat. Its just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I dont know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
Youre not even listening.	When we were together I was too here, now Im not here enough.
Bollocks, Im sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.	Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.	Brilliant.	Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore.
Its the past. Its nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.	I slept with your sister.
Im sorry?	I shagged Amy. Two years ago. Thats why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
Hi. Hey.	Kat.
You think we look like were trying too hard.	Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit.  Its welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
What color are my shoes?	You have feet?
Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.	Youre funny.	Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel like crap, its way better to look hot while youre doing it.
Mission accomplished.	Really?  Dont get too attached.
Mmm.	Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!	Both.
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked.	I dont do naked. My sister? She does naked.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?	Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in share. People do that.
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?	Love.
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.	He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.	Of course he is. Im here with my new man.  I love it! Your magics already working. Let the suffering begin.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you dont think he wants me back?	I dont know.	What does your gut say?	Youre too good for him.
No, count it, anyway.	Why?	Im compulsive and weird?
Six thousand, right?	On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.	How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?	Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.	That wont be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.	Its okay. Hell, Ive never paid for it. But please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
You quitting?	Im desperate to start but I dont have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I cant get enough of.
Who are they?	Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
What?	Its cute.	What is?	You stand on your tiptoes.	I do?
Have you ever done anything like this before?	A weekend?	A wedding.
Not the way youre thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.	I think thats disgusting.
Not you. Youre not disgusting. Youre lovely. Just the idea that theyd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnt...who never.... I mean, someones dead.	Thats right. Imagine facing it alone.
Sorry. Im a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.	This happened to you?	Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
How did you know that was me?	I have a friend at the magazine.	Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.	If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
Would you grab my shampoo?	Shampoo, got it!
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.	Oh, no.	Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldnt be violated.
You shit!	I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.	And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?	Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.	First of all, its never out of the blue. And second of all--
Yes.	What?!	When youre ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
Are you asking me if Im gay for pay?	I guess so.	What do you think?
Theres a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?	My sixth-grade science project was entitled, Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus. Trust me, Im careful.
I love that youre asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?	This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
Dont stop asking questions, okay?	Okay.
I swear. I dont have a signature move.	Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
Subtle?	I disappear. Its not about me.
Its hard to explain.	Show me.
Come on.	Ive got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think its the words: morally repugnant.
Are you sure?	We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
Is this for last night?	Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.	If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.
Dont they have a limit at those machines?	Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
So youre telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? Thats a down payment on a Ford Focus!	Not dollars. Pounds.
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?	No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.	What?	Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.	But nothing did.	Yup. Thats why you get to keep your money.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. Its all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youre not walking away!	Oh, cut the crap!	I just hate seeing you so stuck.	He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.	You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasnt one of them.
Im sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.	Its my job.
You have had girlfriends?	Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.
When I said Id never done a wedding before, I didnt say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.	So, whyd you say yes to me?	There was something in your voice on the phone that day.	Desperation?
What would you do if you weren't an escort?	Make out with you for free.
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?	Spontaneously combust?
Yeah. You?	Yeah.
Fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set?	I didnt say he was worth it.
And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?	He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.	So whats with the nickname?
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.	Youve always got that to hide behind, dont you? Its just business!	Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, well go back to the real world and...and youll be hiring me for your best friend!
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. Its your job. Its who you are. How would you even know if something were real?	Youre judging me?! Oh, thats a good one. Youre lying to me, youre lying to your family, and youre lying to yourself. But youre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
Youre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.	Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Hi.	Hi.
I should go.	What?! No, no. You cant--	I have to.  Im the best man.
Nice speech. I thought it was touching... and funny.	Thank you.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.	You have more than one gynecologist?	Sure. Youve got to play them against each other. Otherwise they think youre easy.
You didnt have to do that.	I wasnt saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
Whats he do anyway?	Therapist.
Like fifteen.	Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
Oh, no. He told you.	You knew?	Im so sorry.
Hey, Sal.	I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. Youre here for the highland flings, I bet.	I get all the glamour jobs.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?	Give it back? Are you nuts?	You pawned it.	Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
You want I nut him in the boat?	Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.	You want me to let him in?	Of course, dont be silly.
Dad!	Hi, kiddo.	Meet Nick.
Thats not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.	Ahoy!
So whyd you let him go?	Its complicated, Dad.	Oh, well, then. It probably wont work out.
Yeah.	Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Im worried. Amys not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it drunker or drunker-er?	Just drunk enough.
Not yet...	...but its getting there. 
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?	Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
I always wondered what happened with us.	I havent thought about that in years.
Shes drunk. -er than me. But I didnt really dump you, did I?	Hard.
Im guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.	Is there any other way to take it?
I am now, sir.	At least somebodys using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
What is it you do again?	What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource: your daughter.
What do you say to that?	I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--	--and The ass of The man who adores her.
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?	Will do.
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.	You don't live around here, do you?	No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.	Is he here in Borderdale?	I don't know, he's in a prison camp.	Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?	David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.	Let me see it...
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?	Sometime, but not like this.	It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?	Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.	Did your mother know you were going to see your father?	Uh huh...	That does it...	Thank you, Miss Johnson.	I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!	I try...
And you say all them people is dead now?	That's right--
They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.	Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?
Here it is, right here.	That's where we come from first?	That's where we came from first.
And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?	Colored.	Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?	Sure--
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.	What's his name?	Dr. William E. B. Dubois.	What he talk 'bout?	Why don't you sit and I'll read you something he said.
You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.	And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
What about Sounder?	He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?	I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
Well, how did you like the class, David?	It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'!  Why was that, Miss Johnson?	Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.	Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...	You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...	He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.	You could? How?	I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!	Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.	My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
You think about your father a lot, don't you?	Yes mam...	Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.	What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.	But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.	But where is my daddy!?	I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...	Nothin'...	And so you did your job, right?	Yes, mam...	Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!	What do that mean?	Means you keep me using my head, and that's good!
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?	Yes, Miss Johnson...	Go on...	Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?	She was dirty and wet...
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?	No, Miss Johnson...	Can you swim?	Yes mam...

I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.	Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--	Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules -- you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy!
But, Charlie --	NO! N-O, NO!
I see you found what you was lookin' for.	I did look, Charlie, but I--	No buts, Rita!	Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!	Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!	You would do that, wouldn't you?	You getting the point, Mrs. Boatwright.
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.	Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.	It's cold, Daddy!	Here, put my jacket over you.
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.	It was too dark, Daddy.	Yeah. We better git back to house now.
Yes, sir...	You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.	Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
David Lee...	Yes, sir...	You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.	I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.	You learnin' anything at that school?	Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?	Yes, sir...
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.	We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?	Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--	"""You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"""	Now who says I didn't lay my mark on you, boy!
Well, looka here...	Hi, Daddy...	Hi to you, son...
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.	They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
We didn't find Sounder yet.	He'll show up one day.	Do you think he's dead, Daddy?	Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?	I think so...
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?	I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.	Why, Daddy; you won't be here?	Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?	Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
Son, that was some trip you went on...	Where was you, Daddy?	That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?	Where did the sun go to, Daddy?	Into the clouds and behind the mountains.	What happened afta that?	The rains started to come, and the prisoners were scared to run 'cause they had to wait for guards to round us up, and tell us when to move -- but we didn't mind the rain comin' 'cause it meant we would git a little rest -- we just stood there, watchin' the guards and they weapons get wet, and that made us all feel kinda good for a minute. I was laughin' all over inside -- a minute, that's all, but what a minute it was!
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!	We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?	You bet we is!	I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Goodnight, Daddy...	Goodnight to you, son...
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...	Come here, son...
Mornin', son...	Mornin', Daddy...
Where's everybody?	They gone to the field...	Guess I can't just lay here, then.
You feel alright today, Daddy?	Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?	Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.	Thank you, Daddy...
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.	You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?	No, son -- they'd have to kill me before I'd let 'em do that to me again!
You hurt, Daddy!?	No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
From Miss Johnson --	Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
"Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my ""hello"" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson..."	September 4 -- how far away is that?
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.	And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!	But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!	Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!	I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!	Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?	Yes, Daddy! Yes!
You know somethin', Daddy?	What's that, son?	I'm gon' miss this ol' raggedy place.
What's your daddy's name?	Nathan Lee Morgan...
Mister, can you visit anybody here?	Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.	When's that?	Sunday...	Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?	Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.	My father taught me...
Miss Boatwright --	Yes, David...	Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.	David!	Yes, ma'am...?
What's in there, David!?	Sausage and hambones!
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.	Then why don't he holler like he usta?	He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.	I don't look like no possum!	Act like one!
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.	Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
Naw, I'm carryin' it!	Thank you, Josie Mae.
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!	Goodnight.
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!	That's right!	Where did it come from, Mama?	Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
Ready to go, Mama!	Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
You got two shirts on?	Yes mam...	When you get outta that school, you come right on back home, y'all gon' have to take this laundry work I done for Miss Boatwright today.
Who's winning, Mama?	Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?	Same as we -- they pray.
Who is they?	Children, come here...
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!	David, come back here!
'Bye, Mama...	'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
Did you see Daddy?	No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.	Can I go when the holiday comes?	You sure can, son...
Any sign of Sounder?	No mam -- I looked all over.	I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself.
What is it, David Lee?	Listen, Mama...
Poor creature...	He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!	Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
Can't sleep?	No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.	So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.	I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.	But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!	Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.	No, I don't and I oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away -- and I would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im.  The field's all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you wanta leave?
Can I go day after tomorrow?	Yes, son. You better get back to bed.	Good night, Mama...	Good night...
I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.	I got to, Mama. I know Daddy wants to see him.
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?	Yes, mam...	Ask your daddy to give you some word about when he'll be comin' home -- and tell 'im we love him.
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.	Did you find your father?	Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.	I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
What's that you carryin'?	Some books Miss Johnson gave me.	Who's Miss Johnson?	Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
So when I left, she gave me these books.	Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.	She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.	How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.	She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.	But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
What's wrong with him, David?	It's the heat.	It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.	He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
What's wrong, Nathan?	He can't get up, Mama!
Be good and be smart, little boy.	Yes, ma'm...
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.	Come in, children.
This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.	Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
It's about the Three Musketeers.	Thank you, Miss Boatwright.	When you read it we'll talk about it...	Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .	Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?	No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.	Thank you, Miss Boatwright!	Don't mention this to anyone! You hear me, David!
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?	No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.	But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.	If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.	But, Miss Boatwright, you--	I don't know a damn thing, now stop bothering me about it!
Come, I'll take you home.	I'll walk...	Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.	I'm used to it.
Hello, David...	Hi, Mrs. Boatwright...  I'm sorry 'bout the way I acted the other day, Miss Boatwright.
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.	And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.	They probly thought you was crazy.	I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.	What did the Lord tell you, Ike?	He said, I don't know, Ike -- you doin' better'n me, I been tryin' to git in there for 200 years and ain't make it yet!
Hi ya doin' there, Ike?	Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!	Whatcha got there?	Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.	Well, let me have it.	Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.	Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?	Maybe soon--
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?	Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.	Is he gon' be gone long?	Might be...
Mama, what was we laughin' for?	At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.	I brought these walnuts to trade.
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.	I wanta get some things.	I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--	I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.	Whatcha wanta order?	I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.	The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
Hi ya, Rebecca...	Tired.	Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?	Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
Night, son!	And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.	I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!	The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.	What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
Good mornin', Nathan.	Mornin'...	You ready to eat?	I'll wait till after the children.
How's the weather out there?	Little chilly.	Hope it don't freeze out our baseball game today!
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!	Ike, you could make a song outta that!
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!	Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
What did he want?	To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!	Did you tell 'im I was too busy for that kinda stuff?
Well, let's get to work!	You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?	Yeah. I feel real up to it right now. Come on, David Lee, you and me'll do the loading.
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.	Is there something I can do to help you?	Yeah, just stay where you is...
There, you see?	I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.	I just got out here!	It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...
Where you goin'!?	To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!	But, Nathan--	Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.	It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.	I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.	Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.	It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.	Is that a blessing, Reverend?
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.	I wanta see Nathan.	I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.	I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.	It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.	You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?	That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.	I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!	I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.	Will they give him a trial?	Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.	You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
What...	Behold my glory.	What... are you?	I am the clitoris.
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!	Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.	Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.	There are more important matters right now...	NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!	Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.	Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!	Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!	Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-	YOU JUST DON'T CARE!	Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.	BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!	Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
What?	The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...	My head hurts.	Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'	Doggy.	Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'	Montana.	Good. Now 'Pillow'.	Pillow.	Alright, now I want you to say 'horsefucker.'
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-	OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--	Success!! Our device works perfectly! We will begin mass production immediately!
Well, anyway... Today children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about the environment.	That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.	I hate the environment.
"Eric! Did you just say the ""F"" word?"	Fragile?
Why the fuck not?	Eric!
Fuckin' a right.	How would you like to go to the principal's office?	How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!	I said -
Dude!	What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.
Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!	About what?	About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This whole thing has gone too far!
To free Terrance and Phillip.	But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.	Chef, do you know anything about women?
What is this?	They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.	That book wasn't Canadian!
-no Cheesy Poofs.	-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>	But what are we going to do against this entire army?
Is it Cartman's mom?	Very funny!
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!	Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
What?	I saw him last night!
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!	We're going... Let's run through the plan!!
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!	How the fuck should I know!!
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.	Sheet!
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?	Okay.	You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-	I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Ze alarms! Zey went off!	Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.	Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!	Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?	Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!	Oh.
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!	You bet your fucking ass it was!
Suck my balls.	Yeah,  <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!!</b>
Dude, how can you hate the environment?	'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!	It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!	Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!	Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.	No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!	Oh.
I can't believe he's dead.	Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
Who the hell made up that law?!	You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!	Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!	Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
Hey Cartman.	What?	You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.	Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.	And she's getting worse...
Come on, just get to the message board!	I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...	Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.	We're not gonna have pie and punch!	More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!	pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
You're late, Cartman!	I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.	Your behind?	I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!	Did you bring the pie and punch?	No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.	YOU DO?!	Sure, dude.  On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby...
You guys! Seriously! You guys!	What Cartman?!	Kenny! I saw Kenny again!

Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!	But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
Goodnight, honey.	Mom... When is the war gonna be over?	I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?	Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.	Oh.
Mom...	Yes, hon?	If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?	Sure, hon. Goodnight.
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!	I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...	I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...	Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
You've got a stupid accent too.	Eric, that is not appropriate.	What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.	Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
Mkay.	God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?	Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.	Eric, you're not watching your mouth!	You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!	Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!	Help yourself prickfuck!	I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little asshole!
Thank God, that sucked ass.	Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.	The N word?	Norwegian Ass Raper.	Oh yeah.	The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?	HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!	No, Eric... I'm afraid it's phase two for you...
What?	Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
You bastards.	This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>
What was that word, young man!?	Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-	I know what it is!
Kyle?!	Eric?
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.	A hunger strike? For what?
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?	I don't know.	Children, I know ALL there is to know about women.
What's going on, Chef?	Something big, children.
Look at that!	It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric!  The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
Hello there, children!!	Hey, Chef.	How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles?
What's the secret to making a woman happy?	Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.	Huh?
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?	No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?	It's... It's not good children.
Who are you, kid?	My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's counter-cousin for some time.

Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!	Dude, what the hell is going on?
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.	We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
What's that?	You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
No... The General is right.	MOM!!!	Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!	KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!

Oh my God...	God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?	No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.	That's gonna take a long time!	Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Dude, we don't have watches.	Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
What's a butfor?	For pooping, silly.
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.	What's a dying giraffe sound like?	Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.	Kay.
Be careful, dude.	Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!	Oh... Alright, back you go.
It's so very cold...	We can't leave without you!	It's okay, I am done for.	No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU - we don't know where the hell we are!!
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?	Kyle, check it out.
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!	We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
That was sweet!	Where do they come up with this stuff?!
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>	Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?	She's not my girlfriend, dude!
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!	Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
Nowhere.	I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...	Yeah!
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.	Yeah...
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!	YOU BASTARD!!
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!	You bastards!!
How can they do this?	It isn't fair!
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!	Our moms suck!
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!	How do we do that?
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?	I don't know, dude.	That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!	I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.	She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me!
Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.	I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!	Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?	What's the difference?
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!	Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
This is sweet!!	Totally!
I'm so sick of these soldiers.	Yeah, they suck.
Does it say what the clitoris is?	All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?	Isn't that in Arizona or something?
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!	What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>	I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...	Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.	Okay...
"""Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris""!"	Wow!	I'll just try the first one.
Dude, do you know what you're doing?	No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Wow, a lot of people showed up.	Yeah, so what do we say?	I thought you had something planned.	Me?!
Oh, brother.	Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Stan!	Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!	Sweet.
WHAT?	Are you sure, Kenny?
Thank you, Kenny.	Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.	Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.	Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
Oh dear God...	What is 'fisting'?
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!	He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!	YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
Oh Lord, what have we done...?	Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!	We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
Shiteater-	-Or monkey fucker-
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.	As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.	What about air strikes?	Huh?	We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!	Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.	Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!	Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!	Yes ma'am!
And Bill?	Yes?	I'm needing lunch.	Right away, ma'am!
You're all part of Satan's army now!	What the hell is going on?!
I am the dark master!	Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!	SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!	Oh.	YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME... NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!
Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.	And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.	SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!	Oh God... What have I done...
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?	No, it was worse than that...	The F word?!	No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!	What is Terrance and Phillip?	Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!	Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
We must take action on this immediately.	Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.	Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft?  As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!	Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.	But I-	You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
Uh, we're just, starting our program...	This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
How is the children's progress?	Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.	What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?	Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.	Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.	I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.	Alright, I'll make the call...
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!	Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.	Oh yeah!
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!	A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
It's from your mother.	My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?	It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.'
You'd fuck your uncle!	YOU'D fuck your uncle!	<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>	<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.	I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?	You bet, Terrance!
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!	I sure did, Phillip!!
Hello, Conan!	Hello, Brooke Shields!
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.	Cheers, Terrance!
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!	This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!	And you call yourself a Canadian!  I told you we should of done Leno!
Fight the power!	The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?	Don't believe the hype!!
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.	Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
Oh, you are such a maroon!	You would know, dummy.
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.	I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.	I know, Terrance. I know.
What's going on Terrance?	Canada is saving us!!
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!	You did? Just now?
AGH!	Terrance! NO!
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!	Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!	You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!	Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!	Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.	Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?	Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.	Hey, come here, guy.
Who's my cream puff?	I am.
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.	I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!	Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!	No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign.
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!	Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!	Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.	Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
You know I do.	I know.	So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh?
What did you do today Satan?	You don't care.	Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.	Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.	That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!	Don't call me dumb!	I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
This is the millennium, Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex!	Hey, relax guy!	Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.	I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>	<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
What if I just left?	Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Hey, I'm missing the party!	No! It can't be!
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!	Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.	Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.	Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!	If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!	Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!	I don't care!  I want to talk about it now!
Ow, you're hurting me!	Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!	THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!	That's nice, Stan.
Did you see that, Wendy?	Yup.
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?	Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.	<u>WHAT?!</u>
Yeah!	This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
What the hell are you talking about, kid?	You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
Hi Wendy.	Hi Stan.
NAZIS!!	What's the matter, Wendy?	Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.	God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
Wendy?	Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
Stan! Stan are you okay?!	Wendy?
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?	Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?	My friend the clitoris told me.	Wow, I have a clitoris too.	Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
Stan, I never cared for Gregory.	You didn't?	No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.	Cool!	<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>	<b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b>
What is it?	Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!	We're going to die here like baby mice who have had no milk in days.  Dry up into crunchy little pinkies.
You don't have watches?	Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.	What do you think this is kid?  Lick Barney the Dinosaur's pussy fucking kiddie hour?  Huh?  This is real life with consequences you take to the grave!
Got it.	And ze rope?	Check.	And the butfor?
Oh my God, what is he doing?	He's shutting off the air!!!
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!	I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Getting drunk is no solution.	Yeah, well...I forgot my morphine back in the room.
I think we're moving.	Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.	Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...	Oh yeah...	Oh yeah...	Oh Sara...	Anna...	Anna...
Jesus, come on!	They're not going to make it!
Evening.	It can't be.	Excuse me?	You're Warren Wayne.
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?	Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -	Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?	My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.	Oh, thank you.	Magnificent, magnificent.	Well I appreciate that.	So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?	Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.	Of course, of course...	So...	Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.	Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?	It certainly is.
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.	I'm sure I will.
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.	Very professional of you.
Where the hell did you come from?	Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
Weren't you down in the dining room?	I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.	Oh he did, did he?
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -	You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?	I did nothing to the monitors.
And what are they doing now, Mac?	They are awaiting further information.
Were you going to give it to them?	I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.	Well you did the right thing Mac.
On channel 10?	The device has stopped responding.
Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.	My...wings...
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.	I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.	"There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction."	And I intend to correct that at once. I'll tell you something Mac...
Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.	Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.	Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich.
What did you say to me?	It's a little late for you to be up.	Look answer my question!
All too well, captain.	Well shut it off at once!
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.	Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?	Well it's a good thing that I did.
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?	There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?	Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.	Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
You're certain of that?	Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.	All right, I'll give it a shot.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.	Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
So, are you on for the next one?	I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.	Why, didn't they say?	Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.	You want to go back to shuttle work?	It's steady, good benefits.
You gotta think of your old age.	That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.	Thank you.
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.	Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?	Uh...
I think I can handle it.	Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?	No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.	Well, maybe I'll surprise you.	I can hardly wait.
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!	Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
If anyone can hear me please respond!	That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?	Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.	What is the condition of the bridge?
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?	Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!	Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.	What are you talking about! Can you transmit the code 3 -	Yes I can transmit the code 3 emergency!  I just don't think it's a prudent move at this juncture.
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?	You better start making sense!	Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.	Then we've got to get to the lifepods!	I'd advise you to shut up and let me finish Taylor.  You needn't worry about the lifepods because they're all gone, jettisoned. Save for one.
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!	Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.	We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?	Well, preferably in tens and twenties...
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.	Will you transmit the distress signal?
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?	Taylor, you surprise me.
I don't know what you're talking about!	Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!	I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?	Look you said it doesn't matter to you anyway!  Why do you want to kill more innocent people!  Why!
Idiot...	Good help is hard to find...
Barnes?	That's me.	Break it down to me, what's going on?	Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.	Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.	Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.	Will do.  What about the distress signal?	I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.	Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.	10-4 good buddy.
It's time we lock coordinates.	I know, I know.
So, what are we waiting for?	Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.	Damage control!  What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?	The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!	Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!	Don't worry about me, I'm changing coordinates now.  I've come to far to be tripped up by some Dudley do-right... motherfuckers!
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?	I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!	Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!	Let's get something straight, Chappy!
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.	This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
Is that clear?	That's clear.	Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.	Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!	Over and out!
Look at this...Jesus.	Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.	No.  But it buys a lot of other things.	Like that piece of ass he was with.	Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.	Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.	I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
What's the use...we're gonna die...	Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
We're going to die.	Will you shut up already?
It's getting hard to breathe...	Just don't move around too much.
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.	That's right.	Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?	Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?	This is my second commercial flight.  I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.
So you were looking for a new challenge.	Well, plus the money ain't that bad. DAWN So, tell me, do you think everyone gets their million dollars' worth on this trip of a lifetime?
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.	Like open an airlock by mistake?	Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.	Well I hope I don't do anything careless.	I'm sure you'll be all right.	Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.	Really?	Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
What are we going to do?	I don't know.
We don't.	Well maybe there's a way out of here.	Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?	Probably come through the wall I suppose.	Well maybe we can do something like that.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?	Just considering our options... sir.
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?	It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.	Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?	With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
OK...it's open.	Seen one like it before?	Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.	Great.
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -	Why can't we?	I don't know the condition of the compartments.  Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
And suppose you couldn't hold out?	Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.	You're right.
He certainly is polite.	Close every door behind you!
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.	Yeah, let's hope he can find a way through.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.	Even if we do, it might be too late.
Everyone just stay put.	Wait.
I can't let you do that.	Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.	Simulated space walking.
I don't know what we're facing.	I understand.
Are you ready?	Ready as I'll ever be.
Yeah.  We did it.	So we did.
You're ready for the real thing?	At this point I'm ready for anything.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.	Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
Explosive?	One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
Taylor?	Yeah?	What do you think's going to happen to us?
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.	Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
Do you want some advice?	Sure.	Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.	Words to live by.
Dawn!  Dawn!	Helllp!
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.	It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
Oh my God.  What happened?	The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
What's that?	A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.	We don't have enough suits to get the others out.	That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
Take this flare.	A flare?  A flare won't do it.	No...
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?	Why?  Where are you going?
I'm not going with you.	What?  What are you talking about?	There's only room on that pod for seven.  That's you and the others.  I'm counting on you to get them out of there.
And what are you going to do?!	I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.	But how are you going to escape?	Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.	But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!	I can't!
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.	You too.
Dawn.  Come in.	Taylor!  Where are you?
I'm in the bridge.	Barnes?
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.	I'm about to blow the wall.	Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!	How does the distress signal look?
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.	I'll do my best.	So what's going to happen to you?	I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.	Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?	Hopefully sooner than later.	Sooner than later.	Over and out.
What the hell are you doing?	We have room!  Let's go!	What do you mean?  What happened!	We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
So close...	And so far.
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.	It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.	Except write our wills.
Will you marry me?	Marry you?	That's right.  Will you marry me?
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.	It would matter to us.
In that case, I accept.	Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...	Try not to think about it.
What is it?!	I don't know.  Wave to them!
I'm fine.	Congratulations on your...recent award.	Thank you.	Is there anything I can help you with?	No, just enjoying the view.	Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.	So I've been told.	Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.	That is one of my priorities.
What is happening around here!!!	There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!	Where's Taylor?	He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
Carlo!	He's in the bathroom.
I'm going back for Taylor!	Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
I'm homesick.	Homesick?  It's only been two days!	We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.	Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.	How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?	Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
Look around you baby, we're rubbing elbows with royalty, oil sheiks, this is class.  You'll be envied by everyone.	I guess so.	Besides I can't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity. That should shore up that prick Hank Drexler.
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...	Send it back if you don't want it.
Well now what are we gonna do!	How am I supposed to know?	You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!	Talk to him...Jesus...
It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!	Baby, take it easy.	How can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy!  I want to go home!  I want to be warm!  I want to get out of here!
Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.	Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.	Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.	I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
Again with the orders from you! You got a Napoleon complex chief, and I'm getting sick of it!	What are you going to do about it?
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?	Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.	What makes you so sure?
What the hell is that?	The engines!
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?	Mac.  What's shaking?
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -	Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --	Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.	Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.	Right, I understand that...
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.	That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.	Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.	Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.	I know but we're in a bind.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?	One moment please...  one moment please...
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?	Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?	I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.	Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
How is it looking, Mac?	I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
Is it safe for human transport?	That's affirmative.
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.	You're not from around here, are you?	I'm from Akron.
I'm looking for a man.	What kind of man?	A bowler.
99 years, 241 days,  15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down.	Find your bowler?	Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.	"My father used to say to me ""Never..."" no, hmmm. ""Always..."" No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations."	Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
Did you hear about that bowler who got smeared? I saw them pull a body bag out of the alley. I heard he was kacked but good. They had to take apart the pin machine to get him out.	The pin machine?	Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away.
You a mini-golfer?	Nope.	Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.	Can I get you something for the road?	You have orange whips?	Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?	No. I'm from Akron.
Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?	Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.	Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.	It belonged to my dad.
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.	Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?	He's my dad.
Heh, heh, heh.	You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
Sorry about your loss.	I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.	You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.	It's splitsville for you.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?	No, pinhead, he ain't here to bowl.
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.	What do you want with old man Faz?
Yeah, basement bingo.	Lemme see your ball.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.	You afraid we're gonna steal it?
Three whips. To go.	When you get a chance.
Hey, you still here?	We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.	Are you guys bruddas?
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?	I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.	Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.	So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.	La da da dalala...	I hate fuckin' opera.	How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!	How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?	You listen to the feelings, not the words.	You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.	It was a clearance.
You know, Elvis bowled.	No kiddin'.	Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no	gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.	Sure, Sid.	But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -	- canker sore.	Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
How do you turn this thing off?	Wait! That's an aria!
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!	Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
Bowling police, step back, give him room.	Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?	Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.	Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.	Think he bought it?	I'd buy it!
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.	Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.	See ya 'round Faz.
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.	You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.	Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz.
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.	Sheila, meet...uh...  I forget the name.
You look like you're something on the lanes.	Theo's bowled on the tour.	Oh, a professional man. What'll you have?
What's on your mind, Miles?	We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?	Seven years.
This scam we got going here was your	brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.	It's a beautiful thing.	A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.	Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.	Miles, I've always been on the square with you.	I'm sure you have Buzz.	Wish me luck.
Buzz Fazeli.	Theo.	I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.	I'm not on the tour this year.	Need some advice, huh.	Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.	Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.	They suspended me for 100 years.	100 years!	I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.	What do you think I can do?	I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.	Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?	I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.	Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.	Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.	That game was before you was born.	My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.	Thanks.
Where'd you get this ball?	It's mine.	Who gave it to you?	Grace Skinner.	Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?	She's my mom.
Who are you? Who sent you here?	I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
I don't know no Grace Skinner.	You knew her. You married her in 1963.
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.	I got a right. You're my father.	I ain't nobody's father!
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.	You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.	What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?	You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.	She thinks someone's trying to kill you.	I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
Theo.	Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's	kissed a lotta tadpoles.  Listen, I been thinking about your problem. I'm not the guy to sponsor you. It would be unethical. But, there is something I could do for you.  Putt-putt golf.	Putt-putt golf?
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.	The small ball.	It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.	Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.	If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.	Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
What the fuck is this?	What's it look like to you?	It looks like dwarf bowling.
I do what I gotta do to survive.	You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.	I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.	I'm your blood.	You wish!
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.	Don't say that about my mom!	I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.	Fuck you and fuck bowling.	That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.	I don't need the stinking pro-tour.	You're dead without the pro-tour, and you know it. Get him away from me. Sid and Breeze punch Theo in the face.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.	I'm getting to like it here.	Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?	I gotta survive.	He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.	You got a better offer?	No...	I didn't think so.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.	That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.	You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.	I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.	Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.	I couldn't care less.
We ain't married no more.	He says that to all his wives.
The whole world thinks you're underground.	I am underground.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.	I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.	What about bowling?	Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.	You're a scumbag.
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?	I never saw you.	Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?	I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.	Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.	I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.	You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.	See ya 'round Maynard.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!	Clam it!
He's the guy Buzz.	He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.	I looked in his car. He's got pictures of you, clippings, maps.	Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.	You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.	Millie, I know what I'm doing.	We should leave this town. I can't take this anymore. I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house.
Son?	Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
My poor baby!	You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
Hello?	Hello, mom?	Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?	I found dad.	He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.	Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.	You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?	I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Don't tell me, John.	Cool!	Theo. Howzitgoin.	Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.	How's that?	I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a piata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?	Uh...over easy.	I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
I don't like to talk about it.	You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?	It depends.	It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Knock-knock.	Who's there?
Who's there!	Buzz Fazeli.	NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.	Who's there?
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.	You shouldn't touch her.	No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.	Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.	What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.	He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.	What did you do to Buzz?	You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you.	I don't want to play.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.	Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.	Who's there?	Junior.	Junior who?	J'you-and-your-friend do it yet?
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -	SHEILA!
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.	Needs lubrication. Lubrication.	We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.	You made me hurt him!
I have someone for you to play with Junior.	Someone wants to play with me?	I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.	Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.	"It's not an ""Alley"". I hate when people call it a ""Bowling Alley"", it's so common! I prefer ""Bowling Center""."
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?	If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.	If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.	No!	I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring him to lane six. Junior will take it from there.
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.	You know who I am?	Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.	I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.	You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.	Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.	What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?	It's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.  How's Gloria's thumb?
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.	"That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your ""big four"", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous."
Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top.	Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.	Nice set-up.	If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.	What if he wants to get out?	He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.	What ever happened to just bowling?	There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.	I like the sport the way it is.	A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.	How Mr. Kastle?	You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.	Why would you help me?	I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.	I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
Where's Junior?	He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.	Ssssh! Now real quiet. On three. One...two...three!
I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.	See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.	After we eat, Dad.	He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!	That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!	She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!	Look who's talking!	Leave him alone!	Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
Fantastic! What talent.	You still got the touch Junior.
Don't go near the bowling alley.	"Bowling ""Center""!"
Hello, Mr.Kastle.	Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?	132, 154.	You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.	She hit it, Mr. Kastle!	Four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for Team Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment.
I just hold it loosely with both hands?	That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.	Grasp firmly. Then what?	Line up where you want it.	Yeah.	Now swing it out a little to the right...	Like this?	No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.	Strokin'. Here goes nothin'.
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!	Yippy!
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?	Who wants to know?  Zeus!	I'm a bowler.	I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
Get that outta your mouth!	They suspended me.
He's not here.	I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.	This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.	I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.	Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.	He's my father, Millie.	He's no father to you.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.	Where can I find him?	The Peter Pan.
What's your specialty?	Whips...orange whips.	Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.	How do you want it?  The eggs.	Uh...over easy.	Coming right up.
Do those two work for your dad or mine?	Mine, and they never tip.
Do you know where they're taking him?	Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.	I'm not here to - I can't...
I came here to have a word with your dad.	What do you want with my dad?	Business.	Won't your father help you with that?	Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.	Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
This is a vicious cycle.	I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.	Isn't this technically a scooter?	When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.	Kinda tough on the butt.	Everything has it's drawbacks.	Where did your brother escape from?	The mental hospital.	What does he do?	He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...	Whoa.	It's a vicious cycle.
Mind if I cut in?	No, not at all.
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.	The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.	Can I ask you something personal?	I'd rather you didn't.	Do you have a girlfriend?	Not while I'm in training.	Do you have a boyfriend?	No. Do You?	No. Not at the present.
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?	Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.	Unfortunately what he wants is you.	So, what about you?	Do I want you?	We'll get into that later.
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?	I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.	I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.	No, I'm fascinated.	Why were you suspended?	I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.	So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?	Well, that was plan A.	What's plan B?	Plan B is your dad.	What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?	He said he'd sponsor me.	Ha! And what do you have to do for him?	Nothing.	Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.	He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.	What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.	Sheila, please.	Come on Theo, what about plan C?	What's plan C?	Plan C...  ...is me.
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.	Really? I kinda like it.
Do you talk with your mom?	It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.	My mom told me not to stay in this town.	So why do you stay?	I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.	I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.	Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.	I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.	How much would you charge me for the lips?	More than you could afford.	Come on, bargain with me.	I could let them go for ten.	You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.	If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
What are you going to do about your brother?	You're here.	What about the guy he put in the body cast?
Then it's true, isn't it? About...	...lane six. Yes.
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?	Nope, I couldn't care less.	I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?	Why should I help that old fuck.	Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?	Zip.	And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.	Way too late. Buzz Fazeli is history.  Too late for what?
Nothing.	Too late for what, Sheila?	You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?	You got any broken bones?	No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.	Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.	I can't tell you, Theo.	Why not?	I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.	Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.	I'm afraid you'll hurt him.	It's Junior, isn't it.	I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.	He's my father.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.	You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.	I'll be at the bridge.
You told Junior that we did it.	It?	It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.	I told him you were my boyfriend.	What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!	We would have sooner or later.	Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.	Did you - kill him?
How do you get this thing down?	Tell me what happened Theo.
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?	If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.	He's dead Sheila.	I feel sick.	You should.	Are you sure he's dead?	I didn't stop to take his pulse.
Where are you going?	I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.	Can I come with you?	I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
Why did you come back?	When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.	If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.	I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.	You don't get two chances with Junior.	At least I'll die smiling.
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.	Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
Theo, Buzz is dead.	I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.	Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.	I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.	Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.	SSHHEEIILLAAA!
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?	Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.	You're really pissing me off.	I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?	My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?	What about plan C?	Fuck plan C!	Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.	You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?	I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.	Sez you!	Suck my dick!
Very professional.	I am a professional man.	Lips still for sale?	You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.	Can you change something this big?
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.	I'm not here to bowl.	You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?	I'm looking for somebody.
Some unfinished business.	If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
You guys got something going on downstairs?	We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.	Basement bingo?
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!	Tell your little pal to let go.	Breeze, give him his ball back!
Very good, busyboy.	Dwarf bowling's illegal.	What are you gonna do, call the bowling police?
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.	So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.	You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.	Your time is up, busyboy.	Who identified the body?	The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.	I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.	"Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of ""New York Bowler"" from his pocket. The headline reads ""RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN"" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli."
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.	Calm down, Dr. Levine.	Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!	Please, Dr. Levine.
... Your civil rights have been overridden!	Open it, Captain!	Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?	They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs.	Fletcher, I want you back here.
Fletcher, get away from there...	It's burning...	Get out of there!	I can't see...	Fletcher!  Now!	I can't...
How big is this spacecraft?	Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
In basic English, what does all this mean?	Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
There's heat coming the door.	Back away then.	Wait a minute --	I said back away.	Would you wait a minute?
Hold on --	What is it?	Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before.	How about I just press the button?
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.	Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.	What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
Norman!	Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.	How long will that be?
They told me about sixty hours.	Two and a half days?
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.	Yeah.  I heard you.	There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.	Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
Nobody move.	But she's --	Nobody move!
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.	You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
Nice work, Captain sir.	Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
Direction's east coming!	What was that?
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.	What if it attacks?	Fifty yards and closing.	What do we use for defense?	We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.	High Voltage?	It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.	Forty yards.	But you've tested it?	Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.	Thirty yards.	What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Where is it?	Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
What was that?	He's right beneath us.
Increase positive pressure!	That's our reserve air.	It's either that or we grow gills.
Don't do it, Norman!	Do you see it?
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?	Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.	Norman, don't do it!
Don't do it!	Now!
Norman, please!  Don't!	Pull it, damn it!
Thank you, Colonel.	Captain.	Captain.  Right, forgive me.
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.	Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.	The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had friends in Washington.
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.	What team?
What have you been told so far?	The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.	Anything else?	Nothing else.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?	Press?  No, I haven't.
Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.	From what?  What's with all the security?	Well, we don't have all the facts yet.
We're moving fast considering the storm.	Storm?  What storm?	A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.	They didn't tell me anything.
How deep is he?	A thousand feet.	A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.	Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.	Then why am I here?	What?	What do you need me for?
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?	Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?	Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?	As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.	Geologists?	Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --	-- Wait a second --	-- dating the crash at least that old.	Hold on --	Maybe older --	-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.	Extraordinary, isn't it?	It's impossible.	I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.	It doesn't make any sense.	We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.	What team?	The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.	ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.	But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
They pressurize us with helium.	What's wrong with oxygen?	It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile.
What is it, Norman?	Take a look.
Picked up something?  What is it?	I don't know.  But it's something alien.
Maybe we shouldn't.	What?	If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all.
"Like ""Thou shall not kill""?"	Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.	You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?	I don't know.  That's the point.	Everything can be killed.
Don't get hysterical, Norman.	I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.	Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.	All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.	Just worry about yourself.
Harry's missing.	What do you mean, he's missing?	He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.	He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way.  Go!  C'mon!
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.	I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.	But sir --	"No ""buts"".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit."
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.	How drastic?	You don't want to know.	I think I do.	A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.	She should've known better.	She put a razor to her wrists a day later.	When was this?	'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.	So you knew this when you wrote your report?	At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.	You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --	Wait a second --	-- and then brought her down here --	-- I didn't know it would come to this --	"-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, ""When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."""
"He translated it wrong.  ""My name is Jerry""?  It's like ""See Spot run."""	The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.	What am I -- a dog, now?
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.	That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.	You don't think weapons are important?	I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
Edmunds?	Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...	Damn it, Edmunds?	... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?	Edmunds?  Can you copy?
What for?	If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.	At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring.
I don't want you talking to Jerry.	But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
You think he killed Edmunds?	Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.	Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.	Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.	No.  I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  He might be listening now.
Going active.	Jerry?
What the hell?  It shut us down.	Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.	Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.	You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
I see it.	Pull it.
Can you open that panel?	Working on it now, sir.
It's not sucking, sir.	Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.	We don't have anything else to try, Sir.	Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
What caused it?	Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --	Harry?  Can you copy?
Subs are still at surface, sir.	Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.	They're coming.
Any sign of Harry?	Nothing, sir.	Fuck him.  What?  Hello?
Nothing, sir.	What the hell is going on here?
Yes, sir.	Well, where the fuck is he?	In the ship, sir.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...	They've left, keep watching!	Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?	If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.	In a minute, sir.
How much damage?	To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.	Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?	I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
It's chipped.	Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?	I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.	I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash?	I did.	Then how can it be chipped?
Ted?  Captain?	Yes, Harry.	We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.	So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.	What?	To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.	A break for what?
So how do we get it open?	Ted seems to have some ideas.
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.	The what?
So?  What's the problem?	It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.	It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.	You don't know that.	Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.	Just tell me worst case.  Worst case of what we might find?
Gimme a report, I want --	Ladies and Gentlemen...	Who is that?  Where's that coming from?	Please watch your closest monitor...
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.	We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
"... spiralling out of the center, you see: ""G"" is one, ""B"" is two, ""H"" is three, and so on... when I got the message."	What's the message?	I have to tell you.  It's strange.	How do you mean, strange?
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.	It's not ignorant.
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.	He understands me fine.
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?	She's not gonna know, sir.
What?	"He's saying, ""Take me to your leader."" He wants to know who's in charge."	I'm in charge.
"With an ""o"".  Harold with an ""o""."	What -- you want me to retype it?
Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.	She's not gonna know.	She wired this system.	If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
A half a mile long?	The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.	Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
I'd also like it noted --	Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
What <u>about</u> a crowbar?	What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
Ted, get her away from the door.	What are you going to do -- shoot her?
Look at this.	What is it?
Some sort of lead or something.	Radiation shield, you think?	A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
What's wrong?	What do you make of this?
We had considered it.	Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.	What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?	Maybe we didn't want to come back.
But what does it do?  This... sphere.	Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.	What?  No, I know they're civilians...
Did you hear me, sir, because --	Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
How can he be missing?	Sir, about leaving --	We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
They switched us over.	To what?	Internal power.
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.	Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
From the sphere?	What's inside the sphere.
I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.	Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --	I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry.
It's not talking, it's mimicking.	Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
Edmunds?	Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
What is that?	The sensors are picking up something outside.	What?
It won't register.  It's too big to image.	Too big?
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?	What was Edmunds doing outside?	Resetting the sub.	What sub?	"In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the ""delay"" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes."
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?	I love secrets.	That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?	I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.	It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.	That's quite a secret.	I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea --
Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anyone what you just told me.	C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.	Because when we get down there --	Wait -- down where?	To the spacecraft.  To investigate.	Underwater?	What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?	We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.	Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.	It never occurred to me.	Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?	The timing has never seemed quite right.	Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.	What -- are you threatening me?
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?	Yeah.  Drowning.
You're next, Norman.	No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.	Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.	Good theory, Ted.
Norman!	Get this thing off me.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.	Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
Where'd this come from?	The library.	We have a library?	A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.	No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.	My gosh, Norman.	Yeah, it was awful.	What about you?  What happened to you?	Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?	Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.	What do you mean -- not normal?	They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.	Wait a minute.	What?	You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?	Yeah, why?	And you didn't tell anyone?
What?  Why...	Beth --	I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --	They are or they aren't.  Which is it?	What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --	Beth.	Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?	Beth --
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...	Beth.
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.	She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.	What could have done this?
Norman.	What are they?	Eggs.
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.	C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.	Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.	So what?	So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.	You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --	Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here...
"""Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."""	Where did you get this?	In Edmunds' things.	You went through Edmunds' things?	He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.	Calm down, Beth.  Alright?	Don't tell me to calm down!	It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
You said something to him, didn't you?	What?	You told him about me?
Beth --	You did, didn't you?	Don't do this.	You bastard.	Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright?
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.	Beth --	No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.
Where are you going in such a hurry?	I have to reset the sub.
Forget the sub.	Don't bother me, Norman.	It's not worth the risk.	It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.	You, me and Harry?	You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.	Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --	We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.	Four days?	Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.	Why should I go?	You should know how it works.  Just in case.	In case you die, too?	I don't trust Harry to do it.	I would.  But my suit --	I fixed your suit.
You fixed my suit?	You don't trust me?	But I don't know how --	You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?	I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?	Still clear.
What's the matter?	You fixed this suit?  Beth?	Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.	My air isn't... I'm coming back.	You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
Still clear?	Still clear.
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.	What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?	Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.	Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.	Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.	He what?
You get it straightened out?	I think so, Beth.  Yes.
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?	Fixing it.	Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?	The refridgerator.	The refridgerator.	It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.	That wasn't in there before.	We must've had it delivered then.	Wait a second --	1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.	None of this was here before.	Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.	No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.	You think?	You don't believe me.	All I know is I opened that refridgerator --	Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.	This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.	You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?	I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.	Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
Page 87.	What?	"Page 87.  ""I could never read that far."""
"""Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids..."	Squids?	"""... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster."""
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.	Manifested?	"Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, ""Stop calling me Jerry"".  And --"
He translated it wrong.	What?
"Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say ""Harry"", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry."	What do you mean, a part of Harry?	When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.	You think, in the sphere --	He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.	But how?	I don't know.	How can the sphere do that?	I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...	Which I told Barnes was attacking --	It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.	But why is he doing it?	He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.	His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?	No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.	Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
Looks like some sort of code.	Why would Harry go back to using a code?
Diphenyl parlene.	Something for burns.	Ephedrine hydrochloride.
It's for motion sickness.	Valdomet.	Ulcers.	Sintag.	A synthetic opium analogue.	Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.	Nothing about drowsiness.	Tarazine?	Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.	Bingo.	"""... and may also cause bizarre halucinations""."
Riordan?	Antihistamine.  For bites.	Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?	Antibiotic.	Parasolutrine?	How do you spell it?	P-a-r-a-s-o...	It's a soporific.	What's that?	Causes sleep.	It's like a sleeping pill?	"""... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... """
"""20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... """	How long does it last?	Three to six hours.	I'll just boost the doses.	What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?	How fast does it take effect?	Doesn't say.	What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that.
It's an idea.	Beth --	To be on the safe side.  I mean --	You want to kill him?	Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
You ever given an injection before.	Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?	Only lab rats.  Here.
I'm sorry.	For what?	Not believing you.	You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
What is it, Norman?	Where are you?	In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
The sphere looks different.	What do you mean, different?	The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.	How's Harry?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.	Your watch.	Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.
What's wrong, Norman?	I'm feeling better.	Are you?
It's getting cold.	You think I'd really drink that?	You don't think I put something in it, do you?	You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.	I did do that, didn't I?
How do you feel about snakes?	Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?	You know what I mean.	Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.	What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.	You tell me.	Do you fear them?	Don't you?	Are you manifesting them?	If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?	Did you?	"What's the phrase -- ""keeping up with the Joneses""?"	Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?	Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.	Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.	No, he isn't.	He can't manifest.	No, he can't.	Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?	You think I manifested the snakes?	Someone did.	Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.	C'mon -- what?	You're lying --	Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?	But --	And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.	That's when you went in the sphere.	One lonely, terrifying sea snake.	You manifested that, Beth.	Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.	You're insane.	Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?	I never went in that sphere.	You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.	Yes.	"You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  ""Like everything's on the tip of my tongue"", he said."	That's bullshit.	Is it?	"Beth, the message said Harry.  ""My name is Harry"".  My name isn't Harry."	"No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  ""Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming."" ""But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared."" ""C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun.""  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?"	Shut up, Beth --	"When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  ""I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water."" Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?"
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you?	It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.	"""It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything."" Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle."
Don't, Beth.	But I have to, Norman.	I promise --	Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!	Beth --	You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.	Don't, Beth.  Please.	It's either this... or I kill you.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.	It's not safe for you to be either.	You think I care?  You think I care if I die?  Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.	Get away from the door, Beth.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.	Don't fuck with me, Beth.	I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
Beth!	You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Where is it coming from, Beth?	Don't you know?
Beth, stop it!	Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
Then where's it coming from?	From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
Stop it!	It's you, Norman.  Your fear of drowning.  You have to face it.
Beth?	Leave me alone, Norman.
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.	I know.  You're too strong, Beth.	Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.	I --	Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.	Beth -- gimme the gun.	Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.	C'mon --	Top shelf, is it?	Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
What is that?  What are you doing?	What?	You hear that?	Hear what?	Get away from me!	Beth --	Get away --
Would it work?	Yes.  And I think we already know it will.	How's that?	Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
Pussy.	What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
No.  I don't think so.	Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.	Well, they're not mine.
I don't get it.	It doesn't make any sense.
Well, what's your theory?	I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
Norman?  Where's Norman?	By the bunks.
He doesn't wait for an answer.	Who says it's a he?
Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?	All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.	For who?  The fish?	For whoever's in that thing.
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?	You'd have to ask them.
Then what is it?	It's an American spacecraft.
What are you looking for?	A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...	Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.	I never said that.	Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.	We never even had a conversation, Norman.	Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?	That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.	I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.	Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
Just in time, too.	In time for what?	What?	Just in time for what?
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.	Another attack?
Why are you looking at me like that?	Like what?  I'm not --	You're staring at me.	No I'm not.  I'm not star--	Yes you are...
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.	We can refuse to talk.	Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
When did it come across?	Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.	Where's it coming from?	No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.	Is it coming from our own computer?	Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
How are you feeling, Norman?	What?	You holding up alright?	Fine.  I'm fine.	Don't be defensive.	I'm not being defensive.	You sound defensive.	I'm fine.
Go ahead.  Ladies first.	No, why don't --
C'mon.	Wait a second, I --
C'mon, Norman.	Look, would you --
Nice work, Norman.	Whatever I can do to help.
Our answer.	To what?	Time travel.  A black hole.
This answers one of our questions.	Which one?  Let me get the list out.	This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.	But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.	Our present.
I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?	Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.	Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.	I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?	Not a clue.	A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.	I don't follow you.	"On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an ""Unknown Entry Event."" They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible."	So what?
So, <u>we know</u>.  We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole.  <u>But they didn't</u>.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.	Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.	Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
I can't believe that, Harry.	Gimme another explanation.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.	Am I?	Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.	You mean, you think I'm cracking?	No.  I didn't say that.	Then what, Norman?
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.	Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
What is that?  That noise?	What noise?	It's like...
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?	What are you still doing here?	You remember opening the door?	You were all supposed to leave.  You weren't supposed to stay down here.	Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?	You don't understand about the sphere.	Then explain it to me.
Norman?	What is it, Harry?	What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?	Page 87 of what, Harry?	I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.	That far in what, Harry?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.	What are they?
Getting anywhere with those?	There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.	Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?	Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.	You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.	Did I?	You don't remember that?	I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
... you there?  Norman?	Harry?	Norman, where are you?	I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?	You're clear.  You see the airlock?
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --	What happened to her?	What do you mean?  She's not here?	When I woke up, nobody was here.	She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.	Her suit's gone.	Beth left?	I thought she was with you.
She's cracking, Norman.	You didn't say that about the food?	I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.	But why would she -- ?	She's lying, Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
Wisconsin's your answer.	Wisconsin?	Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.	How do we decode it?	Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.	The three of us.	That's right.	Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
What is it?	You know what it is, Harry.
It's the squid!  Stop it!	Stop what?  What are you -- ?
Did I kill her?	I don't think so.	I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium.
Fine.	Help me lift her.
We're never gonna make it.	Shut up and open the door.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?	Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.	How far away's the sub?
I can't reach her.	Hold on.
Push her, c'mon.	I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
Missed.	Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
Hold on.	Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.	I heard!  I heard!
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --	Shut up and catch.
C'mon, Norman!	I'm trying to keep balance with --	Gimme a second --	Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!	Her legs are in the way.	You got her?
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?	I'm trying.  There.
You know how to work this thing?	No idea.	Well, press something!	Wait!
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.	Nine hundred feet to surface.	It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
How's that working out, by the way?	Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.	No.  I don't.  But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.
There is one possibility.	We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?	You mean forget?	It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
What'd you say to him?	To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.	What does Norman already know?	Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
She told me what you said, Norman.	What is it, Harry?	Just one of Norman's many secrets.
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?	You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.	Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...	Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
English?	That's right.
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.	Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?	A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.	But it's impossible.	Is it?
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?	Think about it.	Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
All the facts you need are right in front of you.	Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.	Do you?	If it is an alien spacecraft --	Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.	It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.	Meaning?	Meaning it didn't land in the water.	Please.  It must have flown here --	It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.	Arrived?  From where?	Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From our future.
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.	Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.	Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.	Impotent?  I'm not impotent.
Well, if it's a discharge --	It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code.  I'll work on it.	Yeah, I'll work on it, too.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?	See?  No code.  What'd I say?	Codes are for <u>hiding</u> information.  So it's making a mistake.  It's making a code without intending to.  I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters...  Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  So I translated it...
What'd you say?	"""We are friends""."
Good idea, Ted.	Thank you.
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.	"It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming ""witchcraft"".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics."
Norman Johnson.	Does this mean what I think it means?	It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.	The ships?	They're topside.  We're ready to take you home, sir.
How are the others?	The others, sir?	Beth and Harry?	They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...	What was that, sir?	About the time paradox.  How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?	Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?	No, they didn't say --	This way, sir.
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.	Captain who?	Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.	Really?
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.	What report?	You mean they haven't told you yet?	Told me what?
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.	Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.	You've heard of me?	Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.	What report?	Huh?	What report?	You mean you don't know?	Know what?
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.	Who's everyone?	Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.	Geologists?  At a plane crash?	Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.	What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
He wasn't feeling well.	He's a pussy.
You want me to try?	You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how it would have a button.	Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.	Still, make a note I recognized that.
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.	Like what?
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.	You mean a picture?	Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.	I don't see anything.	Squint harder.	Please, Ted.	Try this one.	This is like nursery school.	Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.	The creature?	Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?	"Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch.  You heard him, Norman.  All that ""someone went to a lot of trouble, try again"" bullshit.  And ""impotent"".  Where does he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick."
Well, he's polite.	Unless it's an act.
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?	"When he uses a phrase like ""I am Happy"", I think we should think twice about what we ask him."
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.	Why's that?
What was it?	Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a reading.	Has Harry spoken with Jerry?	Not that I know of.  Why?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?	I'm not sure.
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --	Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
What kind of a crash was it?	You seen my suitcase?	There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?	He didn't say much at all.  Honey --	In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?	Don't be so supportive, honey.	Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --	Four.  Four years --	Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.	Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?	How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.	What?	Was it a military crash?	I don't know.	They never used to send a Navy car.
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?	I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
Well, we'll see...	You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
The Empire must have gotten here first.	The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.	Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.	Well, I've brought you here.  What now?	We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.	Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
No, not anymore.	I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.	Who's going to pay me then?	I think there are some things we should talk about.	I'm beginning not to like you.
How much do you think she's talking about?	A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...	Anything I want!  Now that's interesting.
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.	This isn't a game, you know.
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.	Fear is their greatest weapon.	I'm not afraid of anything...
You have your father's style.  You've done very well.	Not bad.
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?	Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...	We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.	All right then, we'll use your plan.
I'll get the information.	... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.	What do you want with our scan-proof lockers?
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.	Is that good or bad?	It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.	There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?	I'm not going out there.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.	We'll be back before you are, old man.	May the Force be with you.
Good morning!	What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?	All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.	Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!	You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.	Oh, so you're a warrior then?	Of course.  I'm a Bendu officer.
Who are you anyway?	You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?	I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.	I am the son of Annikin Starkiller.
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.	But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.	I know that.	You saw through me?	You could put it that way.	I assure you my intentions weren't bad.	I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?	My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.	But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.	I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.	But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!	Not any more!
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.	My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...	Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.	You mean I generate an energy field?	It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!	Could I learn to feel it?
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.	What do you mean?	It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.	But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.	A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.	How can you store an energy field within you?	When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.	Don't you have a Kiber crystal?	I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...	That's where my father was killed.	Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.	Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?	They use the Bogan Force.	Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.	There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?	Five, maybe.  Let me handle it.
This is the last place.  Shouldn't we just take what we can get and think of something else?	He's bluffing...
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?	I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.	But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?	These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
What's wrong?  What's happening?	Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are you all right?	Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
Are you sure you don't need it?	I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.	What do I do?	All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
What is it?	He can't find Organa Major.
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.	You mean we should go after her!...	I didn't say that, but it appears to be a logical alternative.
I can't see!  How can I fight?	Try to feel it.  Use the Force...	I can't do it.  I'll get hit.	Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.	I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
What about the princess?	You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.	I'm not going alone!
The Kiber Crystal.	Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
Of course, where you been kid?	You look great!  The uniform and everything!
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!	But there was a lot of firing earlier...
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...	But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?	The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.	At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.	Just be warned, that things aren't always as they seem... especially the starforce recruiting posters.
You're Starkiller?	Yes, sir.	Have you been checked out?	Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.	Yes, sir.
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?	I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.	What's that?
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?	Yes, sir, but I can get him...	Forget it, son.
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.	Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.	Should we alert the Sith Lords?	I'll make a report later.	As close as we can make out, it appears to be a Corellian gypsy vessel... It's not under power.	Send one squad up.
We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.	Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.	Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!	It could be worse...
Here come six more... grid two!	Was this trip really necessary?
There are only three or four left.	Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
All the data banks in Artoo are still secure.	Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.	When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.	What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?	The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.	We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.	Where are you taking us now anyway?	The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.	I'd better go see how he's doing.
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.	Did it occur to you they might find us?
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.	I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.	I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.	That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.	We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
Who's the pilot?	It's automatic.
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.	You don't believe in the Force?	Sorcery!  I believe in myself... I determine my destiny, not some mystical energy field.
I found it... It's just not there.	What are you saying?
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...	Why?
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.	All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!	Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.	Don't you believe it.
Well, I practice a lot...	You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?	I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.	Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
This isn't going to work.	Why didn't you say so before.	I think I did.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...	Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.	See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...
I think she's going to be all right.	Not if this tunnel deadends.
Is he afraid of the water?	No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
Watch it!  Move back.	Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!	Move out of the way!
Get to the ship!	Come back here... Where are you going?
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.	They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.	Well, if it's not, we'll be facing that Death Star all by our lonesome.
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...	I know, but the chances for survival here just aren't great enough in my book.  I've got what I came for. Now I've got to get back to my ship.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.	Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...	We'll send a squad up.	No need, everything's under control.	With four casualties?!	The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.	Who is this?  What's your operating...
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...	You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!	It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported.  There will be no one to save you this time.
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.	They'll find its weakness.	It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through.
No!...	It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?	You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.	There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?	He'll be well cared for.
And you?	I... I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it... I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.	If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.	I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.	You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...	But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!	I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.	You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...	Your father's dead.  Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long.  I don't want another word.  Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.	I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.	That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.	Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...	Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?	That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...	Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?	Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...	If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.	Well, I don't know what to do now. We'll just have to head inland and see if we can't find a settlement.
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...	Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.	I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.	No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!	Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.	Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.	I know, sir, but it's the principle of the thing.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...	Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
See Threepio... do you copy?	I read you sir.	You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?	I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.	Are you safe?	For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.	Good.  We're right above you.  Stand by.
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...	See Threepio!  Do you copy?
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...	Are you there, sir?  We're going...	Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.	I'd consider it an honor.
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.	What an honor...	Hey, don't laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend like me !
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?	Something... I've got...you don't.	You rich kids... are all the same !	It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.	Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.	Well, maybe you better look again.
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...	Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.	It's what I deserve.	Whad'ya talkin  about ?	I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.	You made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around.
I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.	What do I want with a scar ?
No, this hurts.	YAAAAAAAA !
Mobile Infantery rules !	Death to all bugs !
Lieutenant's bought the farm. Where's the Sarge...?	I didn't see him !
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...	He was our teacher... He was great.	Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.	What about it, Diz ?
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!	Not enough, I guess.
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...	We're the old men, Ace.
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.	Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.	Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up, Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the Fleet...
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...	Yes, sir !
Saddle up, Roughnecks !	You heard the Lieutenant ! On the bounce, troopers !
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?	Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.	Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?	Sir, no, sir.	Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?	Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?	Sir... I guess I do, sir.
Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.	Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.	Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir.  Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.	What's the hurry ?	Others are waiting.
Did you read her mind ?	Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
Yeah, but I want Carmen.	You got it bad.
Don't think about it... go on instinct.	Ace of spades.
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.	"In addition to ""psychic dolt"" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts."
How do you make him do that ?	I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?	Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?	I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.	Your father will never let you.	I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.	Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?	Eight point... no, uh, seven...	If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.	All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.	Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
I don't believe it !	I got Games & Theory.
Please continue, Sergeant.	Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...	Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?	Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.	Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.	The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.	I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?	I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
You always told me you couldn't do human...	I can't... but like I told you, it's a number's game. The Federation needs all the pilots it can get...
Are you alright ?	I'm getting better.
So what are you doing later ?	Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?	I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
I'm all ears.	Don't you have to finish the game ?
Johnny, this is Zander.	Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
Hey ! What are you doing here ?	I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
"Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you ""sir"" ?"	Only when I give you an order.
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.	Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.	This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.	Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?	Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
Or...?	They revoke our flight status.	Oh, I see... teamwork.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.	Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
Profile's wrong... there.	No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.	Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?	Hey, check it.
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...	Don't change the subject. Am I right ?	Well, whad'ya know...	Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?	She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.	You and me, huh ?
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...	Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
WHERE IS IT ?	"THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !"	It looks like an... asteroid.
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?	Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
Johnny, wait...	Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.	Zander, please... Let's go !
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.	You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !	If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?	There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...	So ?	So who's got time to get married ?
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.	Funny...	I'm not kidding. Marriage is -	No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.	Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
Carmen...?	Excuse me...!
I'm sorry, Carmen.	Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.	You're upset, that's alright.
Where are you going ?	A funeral.	That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?	Yeah.	How do you feel about him now ?	I don't know, Zander.	I do.
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?	It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...	Is it true ?
Zander, what are you doing ?	Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.	Zander, no...!
Good for you.	Your turn...
She's flying starships !	Who ?	Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical	I have good reflexes.
Eeuch !	Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...	Excuse me...!
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.	Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.	Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.	Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.	Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?	I don't want everyone to see.	Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?	How come that's all you talk about anymore ?	It's all I think about anymore.
You can't walk me home.	Why not ?	I thought you were going to help Carl.	Carl can wait.	Johnny, my Dad's home today.
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !	It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.	Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?	Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?	How do I know if this is love ?	It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...	Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.	I'll meet you outside.
None at all... We won.	Good luck at the academy.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?	Yeah, sure, I guess.	No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.	What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.	Zander is going for pilot, too.	You two have so much in common.
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !	I can't help it.	He's nothing like you.	I don't even know if you're my girl.
Are you the boy for me ?	I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...	Who cares ?	You're right. Let's never stop...
I love you, Carmen.	Shhh...
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?	Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...	Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?	Did you get Starside R&D ?
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !	Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.	I'll go for that.
You're late.	My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.	Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
You talk to Carl ?	He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
I'm gonna miss you.	I'll miss you, too, Johnny.	I love you.
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.	Alright, I love you.
Do you mean it ?	I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
Shhhh...!	I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
What happened to your hair ?	What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?	It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.	I try just to be happy I'm still alive.	You don't look very happy to see me.	Should I be ?	Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
What's wrong with you ?	Hey, it's just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !	I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
...I'm sorry.	We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.	No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...	That was just a mix up.	You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.	What happened to your eye ?
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.	I like it. It's kinda...you.
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.	How are you, Carl ?
Take care, wilya Johnny ?	See you on the bounce !
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !	We've gotta go get her !
Which way ?	Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.	Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.	Yes, ma'am !
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.	Yes, ma'am.
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.	Thank you, ma'am.
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.	Bug Batteries... According to Military Intelligence, it'll be random and light. Drop status ?
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?	He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!	Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !	No way, ma'am !
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.	Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
Report.	Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
Where'd it come from ?	Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.	Number 4, contact Fleet and tell 'em there's a loose asteroid headed their way.
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!	That's it, we're empty ma'am !
A lot can happen in three minutes.	Hut... hut !
What ?	You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?	Just throw me the ball, Diz.
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?	Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...	Too bad for her if she's not around.
You still gonna play for Brazil ?	Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.	Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.	How come we never got together ?
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?	Sure.	Uh, look, Diz...	Guess you gotta go.	You're the best.
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.	No thanks, Diz.	What's your malfunction, Rico ?	You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.	What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?	You saying you didn't ?
Man, they're defended... no way in.	Flip six, three hole.	What ?	High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
Cover me.	You got it.
It stinks, you goin.	I don't stay where I'm not wanted.	If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.	Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
Well, see ya.	You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.	What's that, Diz ?	That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
Way to go, amigo !	I'm gonna need a squad leader.
C'mon...	Nah, I don't do that anymore...	You used to dance...	I said no. Want me to pull rank ?	Well, excuse me, sir...
Hey, Diz...	What ?
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?	They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Diz, see what you can do.	I'm on it !
What frequency ?	All bands.	Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?	No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !	It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...	Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Good good, then it's all settled.	"A year at Harvard and you'll  see this ""Federal Service"" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves ""citizens"" and take airs for the rest of their lives."
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !	Teenagers !
...CUT OFF !	Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.	We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.	Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
Oh, my, what's that ?	Looks like rain.	This time of the year...?
This came for you today. I presume on your request.	A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.	It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
Mr. Rasczak.	Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !	No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.	Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.	I'm eighteen. It's my decision.	Oh, is that how it is ?
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?	Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I've always wanted to go there.
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !	Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...	I won't quit !	I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !	I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?	It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?	Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !	Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.	They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.	Keep trying, Sergeant.
Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We're off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?	AAAAAAAAAAA !
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...	I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.	Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.	Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.	My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-	Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders !
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?	Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?	I wouldn't mind.
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.	Good luck. It's not there anymore.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?	He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.	Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.	Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !	Sir, thank you, sir !	Don't stand there dumb... GO !
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?	Sir, yes, sir !
Is that your signature, Rico ?	Sir, yes it is, sir.	Doesn't look like it to me.
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?	Here in Buenos Aires.
Are your parents currently citizens ?	No, sir.	Which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?	Courage, I guess.	Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...	I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...	Aw, don't get mushy.
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?	Uh, no.
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !	Johnny, please. Calm yourself.	Well, that's what you're saying ! You're saying that I'm not good enough the way I am now !
Well, yeah, sure...	I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!	Hi, mom.	Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !	I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.	You can never be sure.
Best in the Fleet !	I get it. This is the part that's best for both of us. Don't do me anymore favors, eh ?
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?	You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?	Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
On whose authority, Corporal ?	This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !	This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?	You heard the Sky Marshall... Move it all down -
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.	Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?	The Rodger Young just burned up...
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.	Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
What do you think you're doing ?	I'm gonna save Carmen.	That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.	Yeah, that's right.
Let's go.	Move out.
Can you walk ?	Not a problem.	Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
How bad are you, pal ?	Been better, buddy.
Alright, we're gonna carry you...	Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
Don't be a hero...	This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !	SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !	What is your position ?	Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !	Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !	Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?	The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.	The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?	Uh, I don't know.	Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
Mister Rasczak ?	What is it, Rico ?	I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.	Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.	I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.	Good for you. Go find out.	Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?	Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?	Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.	I'm not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I need a corporal. You're it until you're dead or I find someone better.
All dead except one, sir.	Kill the bitch.	Yes, sir.
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?	Yes, sir...	Never pass up a good thing, eh ?
Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie for logistics.	Yes, sir !	Who's that with you ?
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.	Yes, sir.
What's that look like to you, Rico ?	Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?	What's going on, Diz ?
Sergeant, secure the boat !	Yes, sir !
AAAAAAAAAAAA !	Cover us, Ace !
Hit your jets, sir !	I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...	We're not leaving you here, sir !
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.	Give'em hell, sir !
Who is...'V'ger'...?	V'ger is that which programmed me.	Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
Where is Lt. Ilia?	That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?	V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?	To join with him.
The Creator is that which created V'ger.	Who is V'ger?	V'ger is that which seeks the Creator.
The examination is a normal function.	You may proceede.
<U>Why</U>...?!	The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.	<U>Why</U>?!	The Creator has not answered.	The carbon-units are not responsible for that.	You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
Disclose the information.	Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.	KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?	Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.	They have repressed the Creator.	The information will not be disclosed.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.	V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
Our data is being prepared.	<U>Answer</U>!	We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
The crews of the previous Enterprises were also carbon units. In what way is the life form in your vessel different?	Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form?	Yes.	Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement.	What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?	Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.	More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
What does that mean?	When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
Within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit. If I can help you revive these patterns; you could understand our functions better.	That is logical. You may procede.
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?	The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.	That is how V'ger will survive.
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?	By the Creator.	To join, and become One with the Creator?	To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.	V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...	'To learn all that is learnable.'	It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?	It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Departure angle on viewer.	Departure angle.
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.	Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!	Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!	Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?	They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.	Engineering...
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.	Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.	You are what...?	I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.	-- You, personally, are assuming command?	Yes.	May I ask Why?	My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...	Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.	No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible...	None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design.	You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer.
Programming ready?	Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
... but I still recommend further simulation study.	Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?	Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Then you acted properly, of course.	Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.	You saved the ship.	I'm aware of that, sir.	Stop competing with me, Decker!	Permission to speak freely, sir?	Granted.	Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?	Yes, sir, I'll do that.
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?	Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.	Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.	No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?	Mr Decker....
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.	That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.	How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!	You asked my opinion, sir.
<U>Computer off</U>!	It's taken control of the computer...!	It's running our records! Starfleet strength, Earth defenses...
The ship is under attack...! Man all defensive stations...!	Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.	They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
Captain, what's the next move?	The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.	I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
, if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.	Captain, we can't be sure that our... move... will actually save Earth.	No!
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.	Captain... I'd like to go along...
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.	Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...	And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.	Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.	That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...	This served the purpose.
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.	It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...	We have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in <U>precise</U> detail. Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.	That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.	It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
Forward motion, Captain...!	A tractor beam...
Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself?	V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator.	We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.	You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
Hello, Ilia.	Decker....!
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.	I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.	Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!	Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
Was he difficult?	No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...	That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?	If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?	No.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.	Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
'Commander' Decker?	Our Exec and Science Officer...
And in you, too, Lieutenant.	My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Time to impact...?	Twelve seconds...!	Mr. Chekov, stand by on the phasers...!
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!	I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
Mr. Spock?	Impact in fifteen seconds...
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!	Ten seconds....
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...	Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.	Viewer, standard ahead.
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?	He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.	Maneuvering thrusters, sir.	Hold station.	Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.	Accelerating to Warp One, sir.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.	Aye, sir.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.	We're already two settings below that, sir.	Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
One hundred kilometers...	Hold relative position here...
Viewer ahead.	Viewer ahead, sir.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!	Thrusters ahead, one third.
Hold station...!	Thrusters at station keeping...
Clear the bridge, Captain...?	That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...	Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?	We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...	See that it is.  Take me over, please.
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...	Mr. Scott, there's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet...
The crew hasn't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment. And the engines, Admiral: they've yet to be even tested at warp power. Add to that, an untried Captain...	Two and a half years as Chief of Starfleet Operations may have made me a little stale, Mr. Scott -- but I wouldn't exactly consider myself 'untried.'
We're losing the pattern...!	Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
Reporting as ordered, Captain.	Sit down, please.
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.	I want him here.  Sit down!
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?	Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.	That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
I still contain fragments of my human half.	And whatever you sensed out here....	... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.	I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.	I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!	Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.	Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?	Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.	Any reply from them?
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.	Our... 'insignificance'?
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.	But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.	Mr. Decker... ?
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...	Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.	Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
Captain, we have been seized by a tractor beam...!	Get someone up here to take the Navigator's station...!  Engineering... full emergency power!
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.	Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?	I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
They had a pattern to follow...	... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.	Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
Spock? Concerned about his chances?	I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!	I am seeking answers, Captain.	Answers to what, Spock? Our dilemma -- or your <U>personal</U> one?
It would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information. A remarkably efficient system.	And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.	New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...	Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?	Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?	A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
What should you have known?	No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!	What answers?	'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!	High mag, Mr. Sulu!
Child...!?	Yes, Captain, a child: evolving into adulthood -- learning, searching -- instinctively needing.
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?	Precisely.
Not for us?	No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not...	There is no alternative.
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...	The point...	The point is, Captain, <U>twenty-two</U>
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...	... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...	That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!	Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...	... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?	I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?	Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.	Why aren't you on board?	Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...	Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...	Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...	Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.	To you, sir?	I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour!
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...	Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.	Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.	That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!	Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?	We're ready, sir.	Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.
Transporters Room and Chief Engineer Scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally, sir.	Dock signals clear, Captain.
Dock control reports ready, sir.	Helm ready, sir.
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!	Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...	Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
The third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming...	<U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.	Tractor beam remains constant...
Evening, Annie.	Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
Cal...	Annie...got an umbrella...?	Nope.	I'll walk you home, you can have my coat.
Then you'll be wet.	I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.	I'll be there.	You bringing your new friend?	Sure plan to.	He have any special dietary requirements...?	He'll eat potroast and like it.	Go you Huskies?	You bet your life.
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...	Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.	Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?	I need a typewritter.	We got em.  North...No, Henry James was the novelist, Frank James was a criminal...  Yep, you came to the right place.  Jessie James was the <u>Brother</u>.  Of the novelist, that's right.  That's alright Susie.  See you tomorrow, Susie.
I want to rent this one.	Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.	I have one, but they lost it.	Who?	The people in New Hampshire.	That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?	Well, it had sentimental value.	You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.	Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.	You wrote a play on it, what play is that?	You haven't heard of it.	What's it called?	"""Anguish."""
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.	I beg your pardon?
I quit.	You quit.	I quit the movie.	Why did you quit?	Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.	Don't be so hard on yourself.	I just got kicked off my first movie.	Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?	That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.	It's in your play.
You like my play.	Yes.	Why?	It's about life.	Could you tell me when's the next train?	N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.	It's about a man who gets a second chance.
I...	No, of course, you want to get out of town.	It's...
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?	First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.	But why the dalmation?	It was either that, or a sardine.
You get what you pay for.	That's true.  You grow up here?	Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  But...do you see?	Yes.	That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.	Yes...	But, but but but...	No, no, I see...	That: in an act of...	Yes...	Of <u>mercy</u>...off...	I understand...	...that...he <u>sees</u> that...	As the Old Mill goes around...	Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...	Of course.	...that it has been vouchsafed to him.	That's that's that's that's beautiful...	And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech.  Just you.
Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.	And likewise.	Goodbye.	Goodbye.
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...	No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...	That whole...
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...	Everyday things...yes.	For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.	I live there.	Really.  With the porch swing and everything...	Surest thing you know.
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...	That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...	...I always thought so...
...such a pleasant sound.	Mmm.	Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...	Yes...	...that.
...who...?	Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...	Mister White is...
Hi.	What are you doing?  I love your script.	They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?	You're still here.	I...I decided to give it another chhh...	I love your script.
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?	You'd know better'n me.	How can you <u>say</u> that?	"It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  ""You <u>can</u> go back..."""	I <u>can</u>?	"You bet your life.  ""The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."""

He doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...	What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?	Me?	Yes.
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...	...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Hello.	I thought you had Play Practice.	"Don't look good for ""Trial of the Heart."""	Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...	That's for sure.
What happened?	Cast stood me up.	Uh huh.	They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
"""Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."""	What?	What are you doing down there?	My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...	...lost the screw...	You got a paperclip?
You like kids?	Never saw the point of 'em.	Me, too.  You have a paperclip?	Paperclip?	Fix my glasses.	Better idea...
Gonna' be good as new.	Better'n new, cause it's got a <u>story</u>. Want to do the other part?
Great.  Who is it...?	"""Room Service!"""	Would you go in...
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.	You have to sign for it.
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.	Oh, God...	And here's some hydrogen peroxide.	I don't drink.	It's for your finger.	One moment.
Hi.	You going to ask me in?
Thank you.	Read the card.	"""To the love of my life, Love, Doug""?"	The other side.	Oh.
Don't you think you should put them in water?	Why?	...because if you don't, they die...

You can do it.	Because I'd met someone else.	Oh <u>okay</u>.	You believe that?	I do if you do.
But it's absurd.	So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.	Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?	I used to go out with a politician.	You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?	Sure did.	Why?	Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.	Yes.	Go you Huskies!
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?	I can't get it to come out right.	What's the scene...	It used to be the Old Mill.	What've you got?	They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...	<u>Please</u>...	"How about, he sees her on the street, he wipes the soot from his eyes.  He goes up to her.  ""What happened to the horse?"" She looks at him.  She takes his hand..."
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...	I hurt you?
...he stuck a fishhook in it.	She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...	...yes.	...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...	...yes.	Has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...	That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...	That's right...	...take <u>any</u> two people...
Hi.	Hi.	Where you going?	Going home.
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...	What?	I told them what you said about the script...
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.	...how <u>else</u> can you talk?	No, that's true.	No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.	Is it...	Yep.  N'it's for sale.  One of the few things money can buy.
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...	I'd love to.
How's your star?	Gosh, you look nice.	...what...?
What would you do with it, the printshop...	Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper.  Show you the plans...
Press still works.	It does?	Did as of last week.
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.	You'd do the newspaper right here.	That's something a man could do...?	You know what else a man can do?	What?
Pelting down out there.	People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
Good morning.	Sleep well?	Yeah, you?	Oh yeah.	I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...	Yes...	We could live up here, live up in the country.	Now you're talking...	...and we could get up every morning...	...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...	And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?	...the better to eat me with, your dear?	To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.	Not without a rolltop desk.	Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.	Happen to know where there's one for sale.	Well ain't you amazing.
Lookit that, up already.	That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
What is it all about?	I saw...
What am I gonna do?	You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?	I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...	But that's what happened.	But it'll stop the movie.	Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.	They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...	Carla was in the car, right?	I...I <u>think</u> that's right...	...you think that's right...
What are you going to do?	I'm going to tell the truth.
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.	If I go to jail...?	I'll knit you a sweater.
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...	Morning, darling.	Morning.
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?	...I'm sure that people are upset...
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...	What I am <u>saying</u>, is, we have to Look Out For Our Own...Now:  they want to close down Main Street...
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...	Water or mineral deposits.	Waal, that's what I'm saying.
We on for tomorrow night?	After Drama Group.	Drama Group?	Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.	Go you Huskies...
And I might have something important to tell you...	What is it, a surprise?	That's right...
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...	Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
What, what what are you doing here?	Yes, that's right.	Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?	What are they offering?	Ten thousand dollars.	That's so beautiful...	I beg your pardon?
"""The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."""	Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
Hi!	We had a date.	We did...?	Where have you been...	I've been thinking.	Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?	I have to tell you something...	Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...	I wasn't doing business.	Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...	It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...	Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?	It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.	Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?	I'm sorry.	Who is this person that you've found?	He works on the movie.	No.  Don't tell me that.	I'm sorry.	Why, you <u>whore</u>!
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...	We'll work it out...
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!	That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?	Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.	Well, then, what's he doing here?	What're you doing here...?
Mornin', Doc...	You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.	Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.	Big day last night.	Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.	That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
What courthouse?	Courthouse back in town.	Town ain't got no courthouse.	What?	Ain't got no courthouse.  Courthouse burnt down, 1960.
Well, where do they hold court?	Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?	Hi.
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...	Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
They're holding it for ransom.	Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
What's an Associate Producer credit?	It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.

Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?	And I need a drink.
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.	Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.	You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.	Yeah, but they never made a movie here.	I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...	...why am I here...?	What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
Waterford, Vermont.	...you got to get me that street for nothing...	I will.	Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.	...they run on water.	Now: I'm looking at the...
Fourteen year old girls.	Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.

How big is this horse?	Fifteen hands.	What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.	This horse is booked.	Tell the guy, get me the horse, I'll give him an Associate Producer credit.
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.	Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.	That's right.	You know who the <u>father</u> is...?	They think it's your First Wife...	That Could Be.

The prices are going up.	But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?	I don't eat vegetables.	Well, I can offer you something to drink?	Sure, what have you got?	What do you drink?	Bourbon and Milk.	How old are you?	
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.	I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
Nice town that you've got here.	You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.	...wouldn't that be dangerous?	...not if you've got something to hold on to.
Are you all right...?	I...	You got to get out of here...
Her...	I swear that that woman in my room...
What else?	"Page...<u>three</u>.  Now:  ""It's a nice evening.""  I'm not gonna say that... ""It's a nice..."""

No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...	Joe, the writer?	Just him and me.
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...	I've always seen that.	We <u>don't</u> show her breasts, we just show your <u>reaction</u>...
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?	You mind...?
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?	How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.	Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?	I'm ready!
You do...?	I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
Is Mr. Barrenger there...?	No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't put her in the car, she gets it in her head to sue, or rape, or some goddam, she wasn't in...

I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...	...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...	You have to what?
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...	Well, Officer, don't worry ab...	If there's anything I...

Nobody touched me, I was at home.	Who is it raped you?	Nobody.	Well, what's the beef?
No.	Then what is the...?
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.	I wasn't in the car.	We know that you weren't.
I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat.  <u>My</u> thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now:  what is this you want <u>Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars</u> to do what you're being paid to, you already <u>signed</u> you'd do...?  What is that?	I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...	Who is her agent...?
Get him on the phone.	He's on the Island, he'll be back on...	Get him on the...
I want you to hear this.	I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...	Well, I'm going to discuss 'em between you babe, cause it's your idea, and you think you're going to sign to do a, then hold us up in the <u>wilds</u> sweetheart, you are in <u>error</u>...

Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...	She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...	...we had a script conference...	I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
Claire, when did you...	I just...	Claire, Bob Bar...
We're just talking about the...	Don't let me dis...I'll just...	No, no...Please.
This is Joe White.	How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...	"Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, ""Thoughts,"" about..."	How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?	Yeah.	"This scene is why I'm doing the movie. ""Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."""	Yes, yes, but...	"""...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."""	"Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the ""thoughts"" you've been..."
What...?	I can't do it, Walt.	You can't do what?	It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...	<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?	I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...	I know that...	Is...Is the Movie!
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...	Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...	...<u>no</u>, they don't...	...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.	Now, look.  Claire:  Listen to me.  I want to tell you a story.
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.	I...I...	Who are these from?
...I can't do it, Wally...	"Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, ""I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for.""  She said, ""I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week.""  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?"	What?	Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...	...I...	Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
...I know...I know...	...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...	No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.
Wally...	I know, I know.
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...	...yes...	...wants a piece...	Yes.	And you know what...?	We, we have to give it.	...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!	What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.	I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...	I...	An artist of your caliber...	I'm only trying to...	I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.	The minute I read that script I said...	I know...	...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...	...yes...	...she has a <u>home</u>...	...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?	He treated me as if I were a child...	Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...	I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
Hello.	...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...	Bob are you alright...?
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...	Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.	Marty...

You show Claire these sketches?	Yes.	Did she throw up?	That isn't very nice.	Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?	I can't tell.	Why not?	She won't stop crying...	Find out when Marty Rossen's arriving, get him a bunch of lilacs to send to the broad.

Kiss my ass.	Well.
What?	Who got their heads cut?	Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...	You said <u>three</u>...?	<u>Did</u> I?  I think you're mistaken.
Where you off to?	I, uh...I'm leaving.	Why?	I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?	It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?	Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...	...I just swore my life away, back in that...	Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?

Arrest him.	What is the...?	Arrest him.
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?	This young woman.
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...	You were in the car with Bob?
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...	...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...	Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...	You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...	And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.	He told you that...	He didn't have to tell...	I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...	Oh, you're his attorney, too...?	Later for you, pal.	Okay...
Hi.	I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.	I...	...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
What's in the case?	Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
And what was it you wanted to say?	Gut Yuntif.
I'm looking for the writer.	What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?	My wife's going to have a baby.	How about that.	Mmmm.  You have children?	No.  No, but we're planning to.	Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?	Yes.
Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...	My wife just went into labor...
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...	He should be put in jail.	Half a buck I'd put him in jail...	You should.	I had a witness I would.	A witness to what...?	You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...	You mean <u>with White</u>...?	What?	You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?	Who's White...?	The writer.	He saw the accident...?	Sure.	He saw the girl in the car...	You bet he did.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.	Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.	I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...	It burnt down.
You told me they had an Old Mill here..	"""Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."""
Town's out of lilacs.	You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...	I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
I...	Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...	I...	We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.	I'm very sorry I...	You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  You have the new Old Mill pages?	I can't find the writer.	...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...	I have to talk to you.  My wife...	Not now.	My wife is going to have a baby, and...	Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?	Did you, where are we going tonight...?	I...?	Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?	My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...	You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?	I...
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?	I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.	We can't shoot the Old Mill.	You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
We're out of money.	You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?	I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.	Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.	I can only write on a manual.	I know the feeling.	Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...	Grace...	That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...	Grace.  Get Mr. White a manual typewriter.  It's not a lie, it's a gift for fiction. And somebody find me my lucky pillow.
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...	I grew up on your mov...
It's about a man who gets a second chance.	Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
I want to make a good film.	I know you do.	And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...	Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?	Um, no.
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?	I don't drink.	Did my matzohs come?  Get some for everybody.  Thank you.  Lemme tell you about my first movie...
What's the...	Where have you been...?
I can't.	Why?
Why?	I hurt my finger.	Get a typist.  Gettim a typist.  Get outta here.
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.	...she keeps her back to the camera...?
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.	I'm gonna nail it.	I know you are.  Go you Huskies.
I've got a date.	He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.	You want me to lie.	To the contrary.  I want you to tell the truth.  The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  And you have a fertile imagination.  Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  If you aren't <u>sure</u>, then they have nothing.  Bob walks free.  As he should.  Joe:  wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart.  You know?  The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us.  Because we tell the truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself.  If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand...?  To our world.  Cause you are a part of that world, now.  You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.  And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll <u>direct</u> the third one.  You are a part of this world. It's in your blood.  It's you.  You have to do the right thing:  we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, <u>literally</u> is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the bottom line. You <u>have</u> to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car.
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...	I'm out.	I don't getcha.	The girl was in the car.	I treated you like a son or nephew.	It's not <u>you</u>, it's...	No, what is it?	I have to tell the truth.	...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...	The girl was in the car.	Then you're finished in show business.	So be it.	And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.	For what cause?	I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.
Hi!	Her tits!  Her tits!  How, that she signed IN HER CONTRACT, we hired her 'cause of ten years at the Actors Studio? The way she played <u>Medea</u>?...Her last two pictures laid there on the screen like my first <u>wife</u>...
<u>Siddown</u>!	I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.	...would you excuse me, please...
Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been?	I...	He says they're looking for you all day, you're on <u>salary</u>, he needs <u>pages</u>, what are you, you been 'haying?'  Now:
You can't write it?	I can write it.  I can't type it.
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...	The breasts symbolize motherhood...
How do they know that, you told them?	No.	What did you say to them...?	I didn't say anything to them.	How do you know you saw it?	I don't know.	Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?	I don't...	You didn't see it...	I...?  I saw it.  I was there.	You were there.  At...at 10:35...?
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...	What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?	I...	You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
What is that...?	...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...	It's lovely.	A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...	My oh my.	I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
You cool the broad out?	I left that for you.	That's thoughtful.  Ziz good, you try this?
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...	What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?	How was your flight?	We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...	Did you bring Bob's weights?	They're coming Fedex...	What's in all the bags?	My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.	I'm gonna' bring it off.	55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
<u>Stop</u>...	That's what I said.	How are you getting on with these fine people?	Like dykes and dogs.
Marty...	"Later for that, Walt, let's get this:  we need the ""pages"" for the new ""Old Mill""...alright?  We need a new title, we need a..."
It's just a formality.	That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
Eight hundred grand to show her tits...	<u>Pay</u> her.	I don't got the money.	Find the money.	I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.	No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?	She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.	Pay her off.	We don't have the money.	<u>Find</u> it.	If you do the product placement...	IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?	"""Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."""	I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?	Actually, the art department had some ideas on...	NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?	Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
We got the permit.	Is that one hell of a kid?	He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.	He's got a gift for fiction.	We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
She wasn't in...you were al...	There's no witnesses...	No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...?
Yeah?	Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
Wally...?	Look, Carla.  This is a hard time for you.  Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...And we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you...
Mmm.	That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.	"Here it is: Statutory r...Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah...""statutory""...""unsupported testimony by the...""  Hold on, Bobby...  You've got nothing, and you know it.  By God, you know it.  Harassment.  You need a...Even if this was true, you need a witness.  You need someone puts her in the car, and you've got nothing.  Now we all have...yes, give her that part in the film.  Yes, we'd love to have you...Now: we all have more important things to do, isn't that right...?"
Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...	Is he cool or angry?
Do something.	You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...	...not the Lazyboy...
...we don't have thirteen at table...	Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...	Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...	I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...	Waal, then, you know, you do whatever would make you happy.  Sher.  This is your party, and whatever...
Where the hell have you been...?  It's...	Sherry, this...
I've got two days to get this house...	Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...	I am so glad to meet you.  We are so glad to <u>have</u> you here, and <u>welcome</u> you to our...I, you know, they had c...I'm, <u>yearly</u> I redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835...
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.	I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.	I want them thrown in jail.	Sherry, Sherry...
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...	And we're glad to have you here...	My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?	Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?	Why would they be illegal?
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...	That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...	...not at all...	...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...	<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...	...the city council...	"On your ""permit,"" but that is less than a formality."	...it is?	I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...	George, that is so kind of you.	And, my <u>wife</u> wanted to, wanted me to ask you, we'd like to <u>welcome</u> you, we'd, she'd like to have you to dinner at our house.  I don't mean to be...
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...	So we just got lucky.
You hear that?	Yes, I hear it.	Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.	"I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, ""What are you doin'?""  He said, ""I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."""
...the damn thing...	No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.	Mmm...
She coulda done better than him.	It takes all kinds.	Zat what it takes?  I always <u>wondered</u> what it took...
"""Assembly of Death"" did 95 million dollars the first weekend."	Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.	You think so?	Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?	He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.	I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.	Bet you did.	But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.	Ain't no second chances in life.	Zat true?	Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
Where are we?	Givvem a cigarette...
We have to lose the window.	...we can't lose the wind...	Then I can't do this shot...you wants me to push in--I can't push in through the window...We go back to New Hampshire?
We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer?	Wally, I got to takes out that window from the dog.  I can't shoot through...
Why?	"Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to ""push in.""  Or I can lose the shot."	No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.	But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...	I don't care.  <u>Fix</u> it.
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.	I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...	I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;	I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
Ben!  What's wrong?	I killed her!
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...	I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?	Mommy's marrying Rache!
I'd rather be with Mommy.	She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.	I don't care.	I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you <u>are</u> in the purple family.
<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.	I hate when you say that.	Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.	Excellent point.
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?	Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.	I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?	Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --	Mass hysteria.	Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.	I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?	Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
Like who?	Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
It just slipped out.	It happens.	What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?	That will never happen.	Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.
I'm gonna call him.	Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.	I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?	Sex.  Of course.
Well, not exactly s...	Why does Rachel scream?
Scream.	During sex.
How would you know sh...	I live.  In the same country.
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...	...why do you think?	Because it feels really incredibly good.
So why are you asking me?	I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...	What are you gonna talk about?	Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...	Then why are you putting on mascara?	I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.	But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...	Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...	Or blush.  You look pale.
Look she's upset --	No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...	Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did.
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.	Like how?	Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us.
That happens.  To families.	I'll be there for you.
Wow.  Who's that for?	Well.  It's for you.
I hope it's the right kind.	Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.	Like a big sister.	She knows every neat junk food place.
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.	I bet.
And don't tell her I told you.	Secret's safe with me.
I know how scared <u>I</u> get when <u>you're</u> sick.  So I waited to tell you.  Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...	You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...	Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
I can't hear you.	THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
I said...	...I'm not deaf, y'know.
He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!	And...?
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!	She is but an arriviste.
What's Thursd...	A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.	I could help with the debate.	Great.	Actually.  I could only help him.	Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...	You don't like his friends.	...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?	Not with my mouth open.	Good girl.
And what do you do wh...	I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.	You have to ignore him.
He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.	This is a joke, right?
This'll work, huh?	Oh, yeh.
How many devilled eggs can you eat?	Maybe twenty.
Annabelle...wake up honey...	Mom?  What's wrong?	Nothing sweetheart.
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...	You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!	I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...	And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?	No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.
I don't want to say goodbye.	Don't. Take me with you.
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.	I'm not.	Let me be the judge of that.
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.	Until he's old enough to read.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.	Yes.	Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.	I'll miss you so much.	Good.  That's very good.
You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.	I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.	You lost Ben?!	Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.	Here.	Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.	I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.	He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.	Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...	Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.	Thank God for that!
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --	This is my daddy's house --	This is my house too!	And this is my room so get out!
The timing was off -- I need this light.	<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...	Hold lunch!	But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!	It's only one o'clock...Why don't you get another Fudgesicle -- I'll be done soon -- really soon.
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?	I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
What if he's kidnapped?	He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...	Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
Your mom had to...help a friend with this...emergency?  And she called me. And we switched days.  Then, I got stuck on my shoot, and...	MOMMY!
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.	See, I...
She still packing for her trip?	I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!	That's so weak.	Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???	Honey, she won't d...
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.	Why don't you say hello?	Annabelle pick up the phone.	Annabelle pick up the phone.	That doesn't bother me.	That doesn't bother me.	You think this is funny?	You think this is funny?	No.  I think it's ugly.	You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!	June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...	Suits me <u>fine</u>!
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...	IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
I <u>did</u> what she said.  I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...	...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!	No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.	That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.	Not use my words, please!	No, baby.  You're gonna use <u>my</u> words.
Help me here...	Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.	Great.  Big ears, too?	No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
Uh.  What is it?	Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?	In high school.	He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.	But Rache...	A <u>suitable</u> boy, will be at <u>this</u> flagpole, <u>on</u> Monday, with a <u>very</u> expensive bike, and he will be a stone FOX if I have to call an <u>escort</u> service!
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?	Ice cold water.	That's my girl...
I hate her.  I really hate her.	There you are!	Don't take my picture!
No they're not.	Annabelle put down that camera.
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!	You owe me a quarter.
You do NOT run out on your moth...	YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
You know, this horse smells really bad.	There's worse things.
...your hating me.	Cos she loves you.	Cos she loves <u>you</u>.  She wanted you to have a daddy to love.  Even if he didn't...completely...deserve it.
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.	No.	Fine!  Eat in the cupboard.
No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom.	Fine.
You touched it.	Then have a donut --	No.	Alright starve.
But you told us to starve.	Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --	No!
Excuse me --	Annabelle let's get something clear.
I made you some cocoa.  See?	Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of you.  Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;	Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.	Mmmm!  Tasty.  You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!	No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;	&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;	That's nice Ben.
Are you <u>real</u> mad?	How could I be?  We learned some magic...
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!	Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...	Dad!  You can talk him into anything!
'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...	Doo-wop-doo-doo, <u>doo</u>-wop-doo-doo...
IS THAT YOU?	IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?	I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.	I have lava.	Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.
Queen of diamonds.	Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Poof!  You're happy now.	Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?	I knew where I was all the time.
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.	No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.	Rachel's job is she works.	Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.	Does Rachel make a lot of money?	People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.	I think she's pretty, Mommy.	Yes...if you like big hair...	Mommy?	What honey?	If you want me to hate her I will.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!	Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.	And many meatballs.
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.	Is that like Luigi's?
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.	Where are you, anyway?
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?	Yes.	Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.	I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.	Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay?  Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
That I do.  Always will.	Mom...?
I'm fine, ba...	Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?	Thursday's fine...
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!	Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
No.	Pray.  We never find out.
Mommy's sick, guys.	You have the WORST flu since...	I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.	Is your bad?
So you're okay.	I'm still sick, but I'm better.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...	That's Rache's song!	Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...	No!  I have to get there.	Where Ben?	Before you.	Ben where do you have to get to?	Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.	How do you know?	Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.	Oh.
Okay.  These are good.	I helped.
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...	Rache can do that part.
Find the bird cage?	Rache says it's from you.	Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?	You dying.
If a soldier loses his legs in a war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure he is.	But you can still see him.	Half.  Of him.
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.	So where are you?
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.	Can I talk to you?  When you're there.	Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll know.  What I'm saying.
It's not good enough.	No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...	You've got a fruit loop in your hair.	You say that like I don't know that.	I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --	And when did that pass?	Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...	Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.	Every day.  More and more.
So we'll...radiate some more?	At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
That's necessary, huh?	Let's take our best shot.
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...	Have you still never told him?
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...	Sooner than later.  You really need to.
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.	Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...	But you're not <u>done</u>!
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...	We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
Which part of no don't you understand?	Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...	They're losing one mother.  They can't lose two.
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...	Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!	No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.	Rachel, <u>don't</u> do this, you will <u>never</u> forgive yourself!
Planning on getting --	Remarried.  There is no move.
Are you here?	I'm here.	Because you don't really seem here.	I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!	Something's up wi...	You think I didn't get that?
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.	Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --	Rachel's not half my age.	We're not discussing your age.	Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.	They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.	Jackie, they come to be part of my life.  Rachel <u>is</u> part of that life.
Napalm.	Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --	Jackie, she was five minutes late --
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.	It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.	I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.	You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...	I'm worried.	Me too.	Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.	Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.	Easy enough.	Good...Well...Take care.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...	You're WHERE?	At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...	Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!	...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
Our children.	Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...	But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.	Not to me.	Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --	I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.	Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.	We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
Called him.  We set an ap...	Don't do this.
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.	Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...	<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
I'm afraid she's going to walk.	And I'm supposed to care.
Still, please.	Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.	Getting so beautiful...she looks more like you every day.  Jackie...I've really given this a lot of thought.  A great deal of thought...
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...	Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...	Just not to me.
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.	To make it easier for them or you?	It's a huge moment in their life --	You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient.	We...	WE are over.	WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.	No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.	Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?	And we all went through that together?
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.	Stop.  You're making me insecure.
It's temporary.	It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....	Never stand between that kid and a meatball.	Yet another spaghetti night.	Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that.
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.	We're going to win this.	Walk in the park.  And thanks for the 'we'.
What happens next?	I live or I die.
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.	A lot smaller.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.	This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...	Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?	Can I please have a cup of coffee?	We don't have any coffee.	What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?	Annabelle, how's your video rep...
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?	Maybe you could back off just a little bit --	What did you do?	Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...	...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...	<u>Forgiveness?</u>  For <u>what</u>, exactly?
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.	I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.	I was in there in him.
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?	No.  I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --	You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.	You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!	Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.	Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!	Get out!	But it's not on the schedule!	You got to hell!
Machines do not EAT message.	Look, I...	Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart.
Yeh?	Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.	I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...	You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.	Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...	A court <u>order</u> is gonna say that <u>woman</u> is <u>never</u> <u>alone</u> with my children!  Ever <u>again</u>!  Do you HEAR that?
...in.	I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...	I don't recall inviting you.
I have a snoop.	I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...	I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.	You're not terribly good at taking care of h...	I need practice.	Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
So why did y...	I did it for her.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.	What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
However many.  It's not enough.	I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.	Fine, forget it.
Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...	Why not just bring the whole toilet?	Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?	Not personally.	Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.	It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
I'm sorry, I just...	Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.	No way.  I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens...
What about obsessively picking her split ends?	Anxiety.	Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --	She was angry at herself.	Jackie?	Yes?	When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
You feeling all right?	Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.	Wowie.  How wonderful!
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.	Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...	Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
I don't know wh...	I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
My boss.	You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.	You WHAT?	You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
Look, you've never liked me...	Don't flatter yourself.	And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...	Nobody likes a snoop.	But I came here to...
Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...	We can't live like that.
Did I hear the word...	Luke.  Can't live like that.
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...	...it's my problem, too.
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.	Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups?
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.	You're not dying.
You bet you are.	How the hell would you know?	I don't, but...	How would you know <u>anything</u>?
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.	You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
They came out of my <u>body</u>!	See, I know that.	I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!
Okay, I'm undeserving.	Ironic, huh?
Small world.	Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...	You're a cross-dresser.	That.  And.  Annabelle is over her head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
She hasn't mentioned this.	She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
Moi?	Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...	...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.	Anyway.  He walks up to her on lunch yard today.  And tells her... publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'
Oh, my God.	Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.	She's devastated.	Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
And you said...?	Beats me.  Ask your mom.
Can I look at the pictures?	It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
So.  Hopeful.	It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
I really look like shit.	You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.	Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...	Brad Kovitsky.
The primo stuff is great for pain.	I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.	And you said...	What else?  Keep on keepin' on.
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?	Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...	How's she doing with Brad?
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...	Thanks, but it's under control.
Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...	It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her?
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...	...go to the park.  In the worst way.
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?	No.
It's just not the right time t...	Do what you've worked your whole life to do?	It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.	You mean, after I'm dead?
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...	Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.	It's the same choice you made.	Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.	I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...	That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy.
My advice to you?  Don't die.	Feeling the pressure?
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.	And her...?	Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...	Is that what he told you?	He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...	Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
Looks nice enough to m...	He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.	Are we.	And I'm going to win.	Don't be too sure.
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?	It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...	Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...	Give 'em my number.
Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.	Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?	You are <u>defending</u> what you did?	Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
You put filth in my child's mouth.	Aw.	You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!	Worked.  Like a charm.
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...	So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.	That's not wh...	You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?	You weren't passing 'em out.	Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.	Oh please.	Shut the fuck up.  <u>I</u> didn't go behind <u>your</u> back.
Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...	She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.	Well, that's what parenting is <u>about</u>, little girl.  They are <u>pleading</u> to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell <u>showed</u> her.
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.	And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.	<u>That's</u> what it is.  And that's <u>all</u> it is.
Thanks for coming out.	Neutral ground.  What's up?
She likes a Stolie, no ice.	Double.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?	Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...	No, there isn't.	And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be.  And I can't handle it.
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...	Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...	Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?	Maybe I was wrong on that one.
You're lying.	I lost him.  I was panicked.	You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!	I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
Ben never mentioned it.	He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
Why didn't I?	Uh.  You hate my guts?
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.	What do I have that you don't?	Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...	You're the hip and fresh.	You ride with Annabelle...	You'll learn.	You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...	I have their past.
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.	Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...	Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...	It was a veal stock, I thi...	Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it!  Boiling down half a ton of bones...
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.	We have to talk.	Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...	I didn't want to spoil our supper...	You'd rather spoil our walk home.	Yeh, it's cheaper.
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.	So I'll have to order in?	We have the kids this weekend, so...	Jesus.
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.	For what?	Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...	I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --	You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.	Can't handle them myself is what you mean.  Can't.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.	I trust you of course I do but --	But?  But what?	But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.	I know how responsible, caring adults parent children.  I'm bribe 'em.  But 'em a dog or something.  Maybe a Doberman.
Look.  I know they hate me.	They don't hate you --	And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --	Nobody's telling them to hate you --	Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.	It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --	Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...	No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --	You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long!  Jesus what did you see in her?  I don't get it -- I just don't get it.
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.	Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.	Not yet.	Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...	We have the kids.  Next weekend.	And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...	Our weekend.  At that sweet little B &amp; B.
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?	Rache, get out of th...	You haven't done <u>one</u> goddam thing to make any of this easier...
Oh my God.  Are you serious?	I think so...What do you think?	I think so too...
It's forever you know.	Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?	Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.	Rache, it may take time.	What's eight, ten years?  Hell, you'll still be ambulatory.  I think.
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...	It's no biggie.
It's just an assignment.	It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.	Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
They're my kids.	Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
She's not gonna die.	I know that.
No problem.	I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
What a great surpri...	Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.	Well, they will be.	Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
Why in the world would she t...	You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.	I needed some time away.	...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...	'...the kids have camp.  Their friends are here.  Over there, I'll just be shopping in a language I don't even know.  My life, and the kids' lives, aren't here to service your mid-life crisis.'  Did it go like that?
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.	What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
Can we go sit somewhere?	Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
I told her I loved her.	By way of saying you were unhappy.	Restless.	Excuse me.  'Things are so confusing for me, Jack.  Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules.  When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.	No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.	No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'	That's not us.	Because you've changed so much.
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.	How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
Where you goin'?	I'm gonna get me a drink.
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.	Does Jackie know this?	No.  I'm doing it behind her back.	In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?	Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...	Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
I don't know what's wrong with that kid.	Maybe he's gay.	Don't ever say that.	What if he is?	He isn't.
Out! Leave the table!	What?	You heard me: leave the table!	Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.	Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?	Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
Hey.	Hey. What's up?	There's something I need to talk about with you.	What?	There are some rumors...	Like what?	You know...Stanley...	Oh.	And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined.
No prob. I'm cool.	Thanks, Scoob.
Marty, ignore him.	He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.	He was in a concentration camp?	Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.	But I thought he came over to America before the war.	Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.	Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?	But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?	Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?	I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?	I'll be your guest!	Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
Welcome to the show, Scooby.	Thank you.	Nice to have you here.	Great to be here.	And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?	Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.	Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?	Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.	TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
Consuelo?	Yes, Mikey?	Do you have any brothers or sisters?	Yes.	Really? How many?	Four brothers and five sisters.	Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?	It was God's will.	But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?	No.
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?	I did not go to high school.	Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?	We had to work. My family was poor.	Must've been hard being poor.	I'm still poor.	Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?	No, Mikey.	But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?	I'm always working.	But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?	This is work.	But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.
Consuelo. Are you crying?	No.	Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?	Mi Jesusmi jesus	Speak English.	Mi Jesus esta muerto!	Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.	My Jesus	Who is Jesus?	My baby.	You have a bay?	My grandchild-baby.	Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?	He's dead.	Oh. How did it happen?	He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.	How did they execute him?	Poison gas.	Maybe it's for the bestI mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrongPeople who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?	Jesus was not bad.	Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.	He wasn't.	But still, you can't be sure.	I am sure.	But really, you never know.	I know!	Why was he on Death Row?	For rape and murder.
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?	It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.	Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
So whaddya think?	Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.	I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.	You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.	No, you don't.	Yes, I do. I love them!
The camerawork's nice.	Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper.
This is definitely better.	You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?	This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.	Yes, I knowBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining.	I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.	No, no, no. No exploitation. This is seriousBut don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?	You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?	Nothing, I guess	I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?	OK, you're right, you're right  You know, we need to screen what we've gotinvite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this.	I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening	OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.	We're not ready.	Hip alternative types who will understand the process better	We're not ready!	Well, I need to see this with an audience!	What's an audience going to tell you?	I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
Don't even joke about that!	I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Twinkeys!	Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
Mom?	Yes, Mikey?	I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?	What?	550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade!
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.	Got a lot of homework?
Marty...	You started filling out your college applications yet?
Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?	Don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
We used pull.	You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
It's all about who you know.	Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.	He's right.
Sure!...	Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
Was anyone in my room today?	Is everything OK?	My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend.  Hey. Can you pass the salad over.
What are you going to do?	I dunno.
We did the same thing last year also.	How was the class?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.	But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?	Fine.	Ready for tomorrow?	What's tomorrow?	The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?	Huh?	I can read it to you.	You mean, again?	Well, I changed the ending a little.	Oh. What happens now?	Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.	Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.	But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.	I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?	You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
You're tired of me. I can tell.	Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.	You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.	I was never much of a sweater. You know that.	Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind.
What do you want?	Don't be so upset. It's OK...	What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?	You know he hated my story also.	Your story was terrible!
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!	Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!	"That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine."	Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.	I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.	You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?	Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.	Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but 
Reconceive.	'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.	Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
But what kind of pull did you have?	I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit aa speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.	...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
Fuck!	I'm going in there.
I dunno.	Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
What DO you know?	Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
So? How was school today?	The same.	The same. Same as what?	Just the same.
Get the hell outta here!	Man, it's just, like, conversation.
Scooby?	Yeah?	We have to talk.
Whaddya wanna talk about?	Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
OK.	Tired of this shit...
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.	Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.	Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
Dad?Do you think that Brady will ever get better?	One in a million recover.	Maybe he's that one in a million!	Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.	Thanks.	You're welcome.  Dad?Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?	Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.	OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?	OK!
Hey, Mikey!	Hi, Dad!	Come here, give me a hug!	Gee, you're home early!	Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.	Sure, Dad.
Hello, Vi.	What are you doing here?	What are you doing here?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.	Well, now you have.
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?	Uh huh.	Can I join you?
You're not.	Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...	That's good.	And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
You have beautiful skin.	Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.	Maybe. She's OK.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...	I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.	Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?	No.	Thank you for being honest.
It's over there.	Thanks.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?	Take off your top.
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.	Say, Ni...	Ni...	...gger.	...gger.	Say, 'Nigger.'	Nigger.	'Fuck me hard!'	Fuck me hard!	Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'	Nigger, fuck me hard!	Again!	Nigger, fuck me hard!!...	Again!!	NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
No, not really.	Any books you like to read for fun?	No.	None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?	I hate reading.	All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.	OK.	'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?	I dunno...	C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.	Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.	Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?	I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Hello?	Hello, is this Pam?	Who is this?	Toby Oxman.	Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?	Oh, fine. How are you?	Great!	Great!	So what's going on?	That's what I was gonna ask you.	But...you called.	Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...	Yeah.
So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?	Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?	Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.	Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?	Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
I believe it.	Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.	Oh, that's too bad.	Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.	Anything I might know about?	Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.	That's too bad.	I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.	That's good. So then what do you do now?	I'm a documentary filmmaker.	Oh? Anything I might have seen?	N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?	Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.	Oh, I don't remember that...	I do.	Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.	Hunh.
That's good.	Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.	Yeah. But not any more.	Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?	Yeah.	Huh. Kids?	Yeah.	How many?	Three.	Great. How old are they?	Eight, six, and four.	Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?	Yeah, sure.	OK. Bye.	Maybe she has caller ID.
Pretty cool, Stanley.	Thanks.	How'd you get it?	It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.	Gee, your Dad's smart.	I know.	Is it loaded?	No, I don't think so...
Scooby, don't! Be careful!	I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.	I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.	You should be.
Scooby?	Yeah?	You know...I like you.	Yeah. I know.	I mean...
You want some?	No, thanks.
You a pervert?	No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?	Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?	Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.	What for?	Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.	Is this to like get into Sundance?	Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.	Doubt it.	Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.	Whoopee.	HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
So like, yeahI caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviewsY'know, I figure I can always drop out.	So where'd you get in?	Prnceton.	But what did you get on your SATs?	200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, good-weird.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wonderingIs the documentary almost finished?	Uh, yeah, we're getting there.	Can I see what you have so far?	Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.	Thanks man.
What is most important to you?	I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?	He did?	Yeah. He went to Harward.	Oh.
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...	Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?	Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.	Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?	Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--	Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?	Y-yes--	Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?	Well, I-I hope that--that--	Times up!
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.	"I now understand the expression ""you get what you pay for!"" A bunch of chumps!"	Listen man, I don't need this shit--
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!	Well get someone down there!	There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
Is he with the girl?	I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
I'll lead.	Why? Are we going dancing?
I said I'll lead.	What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.	I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.	If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?	I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.	Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?	Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
What are we going to do!	Who's got matches?
What now?	We're outta here--
--be prepared.	We don't have time!	Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
Let's move it we got company!	What happened!
Forget about it.	I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...	You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
What do you mean?	After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.	What's that supposed to mean?	What do you think?	Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--	No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
Cooper...	Yeah?...
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.	What happened?	By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down, in a bed of bloody azaleas.
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.	Used to Filmore, used to.
Now what?	There's the fence...
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!	What are you talking about?	They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?	Because I'll be firing at them.	You're talking about committing suicide!
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!	Rule two:  without alternative, use yourself as a shield.
Well Filmore--	Well Cooper...	Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...	I guess not Cooper...
I have a lighter!	Even better.
How well do you know this place?	We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--	Are the labs in operation?	I don't see why they wouldn't be.	Good...
How's the arm?	It's nothing to worry about.	We wouldn't have made it out without you. FILMORE Or without you.
That's it!  Up ahead!	Where does it lead?	The maintenance hatch--it takes us outside the building!
Enjoying the tour so far?	Are you going to kill us?	I don't know.  If you gave me a reason to...
Go fuck yourself...	Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...	You're going to pay for this...	You got it all backwards, Helen--but that's OK, you work for the government...
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?	It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...	Like where--in your dreams?
I suppose...you think I should thank you.	Yes, you should.
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--	Shut up!
Come on, drink up.	I don't want any...	I insist...	I said I don't want any, goddammit!
Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.	She's still alive.	The transmission is an hour old...
Well?	We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.	Good.	We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!	Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
What about Cooper--where is he?	He's in there...
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.	She's as good as gone...	You can't think like that!  We're watching them like a hawk--he's bound to trip up, make one false move--
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.	Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.	I'm sure you'll figure it out.
Who's Ryan Cooper?	I'll let the senator tell you.
And what exactly do they intend to do?	The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!	I don't think you--grasp--the situation, Mr. Myers.
So, what are we looking at White?	What do you mean?	What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?	I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...	Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--	Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!	I haven't been briefed on any such thing!	Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!	What the hell is it, anyhow?	Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.	How much do they have?
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...	What!	They were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time--without anyone being the wiser...
How goes the roll call?	We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.	I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.	I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.	Richter-we got a problem!
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.	Excellent...excellent!
Where the hell could they have gone!	What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.	I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...	You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
What's happening at the waterfront?	We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.	Excellent.
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?	Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.	Good.	I say we head out.	Agreed--let's move it.	Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.	Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!	Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?	Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--	Dissent?	You know, when we reach Kompong Som--
Are we adrift--	If I don't get power up we are!	Drop the anchor!	We can't--it's power driven!	Get your men to do it!	The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
Just what the hell is he talking about?	We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--	How much of this shit do they have, White!!	They must have got their hands on a test vial!	What does that mean?	There's enough in one vial...
Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.	You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!	"All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General ""Buck"" Schmuck with the respect due him."
Can I have a glass of water?	Certainly - how about some breakfast?	Possibly some coffee?	Moffo!
Thank you, Admiral.	Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.	The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?	Don't be ridiculous.	I have your word, Mister President?	Yes, of course.
Where are you trying to reach him?	At his office in the Capitol.	If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.	Did you get that, Kulnick?
What's the meaning of this?	I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.	I'll hold this, if you don't mind.  You can have it back when you leave.
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.	Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.	Where is this...thing?	It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?	First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.	That's preposterous!  We have no such program!	The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.	The report is entirely untrue.  I can assure you of that.
Yes?	Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.	It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.	How dare you talk to me in this manner?
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!	Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!	That's nonsense, and you know it!	I know nothing of the sort!	Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?	And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.	Don't you realize that despite your incredible distrust and suspicion, that in fact, you place a far greater trust in us than inspection would require?  You trust us not to cause a war accidentally - and, of course, we are obliged to place the same trust in you.
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.	Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.	We have many splendidly deep mines in our country.
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.	Oh, yes, that's right.
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.	Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?	I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.	Give that back to me.	What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?	Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.	Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?	You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.	Then all you have to do is untrigger it.	Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?	You mean you'll tell us his name???	"It's not a he, General.  It was an article in the ""Times"" about a year and a half ago."
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left.	See!  See, I told you.
My seven body orifices????	That's right, fella.	One, two...  three, four...  five...  Why you, dirty, stinking...
"Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel ""Bat"" Guano, 701 Battalion."	Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...	Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?	I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.	What are you talking about, Major?	The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.	Get a grip on yourself, Major!	It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
Now, snap out of it, fella!	Who the hell do you think you are, sir???
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.	Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Do you have any witnesses, Major?	What?	What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?	Look, I didn't shoot him!	We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?	Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.	Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.	Colonel, don't you know what's going on?	Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.	Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.	You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!	Didn't they tell you?	They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.	Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.	Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect...	Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.	On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.	Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?	You've wasted enough of my time, fella.	Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!	What about the President?	He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?	So what?	Well, I'm General Ripper's Executive officer. He'll want to talk to me.
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.	That's government property, Major.	Colonel, remember, a reprimand from the President can be pretty serious to a career officer...Just a second, operator, I know I have it somewhere.
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.	What is your name, young lady?	Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.	What did you say?	Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.	Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
Yes!	General Schmuck?	Yes!  Who the hell is this?
Go back to sleep, baby.	What did you say, sir?
I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?	General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing.  It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert.  It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?	No, sir.	Then why bother me with this nonsense? Get in touch with the base commander.
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.	I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
Does the threat board show anything?	Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
Well, Mister President.	What kind of trouble?	Well, sir, about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders, General Jack D. Ripper, sent out attack orders to the thirty-four B-90's of the 843rd Bomb Wing, under his command.
General Schmuck?	Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???	To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.	You aren't sure!	"Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  ""Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now.""  Then he hung up."	Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.	Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?	Buck, when I told you to give them right up to the top, you said we couldn't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he's a psycho.
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!	I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.	Yes?	Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.	I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.	Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.	That's a very wise deduction, General.	Thank you, sir.  But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?	Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.	You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.	But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.	What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?	That certainly would be a problem, sir.
"I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel ""Bat"" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did."	I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.	Yes, sir.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.	This is General Ripper speaking.	Yes, sir.	Do you recognize my voice?	Certainly, General.  Why do you ask, sir?
Why do you think I ask?	I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.	Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?	No, sir.
Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?	Yes, sir.	All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.	Condition Red!	That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.	Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!	A shooting war!	Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.	But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?	Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.	Yes, sir.
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.	That's right, sir.	We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?	You're right, sir.	No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.	I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.	No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.	Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?	Who do you think you're talking to?	To you, sir.  But how do I know?	Are you trying to be insubordinate?	No, sir.	I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.	Plan-R????	Are you hard of hearing, Major?	No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.	As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.	General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.	Are you questioning my orders, Major?	No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.	You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.	Thank you, sir.	Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.	Yes, sir.	And lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded.  They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. Air Police will have lists of all owners.
What's the gun for, General Ripper?	Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.	Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?	That's right, Major.
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?	Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.	I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.	Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?	Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.	Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?	That is correct, Major.	And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?	You know the regulations well, Major.	Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.	That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.	Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?	And if that were true?
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?	Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
Suppose that were the case?	But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.	Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.	I know that, sir.	We've come a long way since World War II, Major.  And the lessons we've learned are all in Plan-R.
I suppose they are, sir.	You're damned right they are.	How much soda, sir.	Just a squirt.
That about right?	Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.
What shall we drink to, sir?	To peace on earth.
General Ripper, can I ask another question?	Ask away, Major.	Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?	I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.	No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.	Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?	I don't think so, sir.	He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.	I see.	When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?	I'm trying to, sir.	You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.	But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?	If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?	Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?	That's close enough, Major.	But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?	You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.	Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?	I guess so.	I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.	But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.	You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.	But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.	Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?	Where, sir?	Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.	Not yet, Major.  Not yet.	And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.	You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?	Yes, sir.  But so do we.	But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.	I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.	But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?	Right.	Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?	Well, sir, like I said, for the same reasons we do.  I mean, all the experts say the most likely way for War to start nowadays is by an accident, or a mistake, or by some mentally unbalanced person --
Go on, Major.	I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.	"I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, ""There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."""	That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?	Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.	Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?	Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?	No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.	Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.	Major, you're talking like one of them!	Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.	Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.	Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?	I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.	But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.	But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?	If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.	And you'd like to see that?	General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.	Do you think we'd cheat?	No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.	Do you think they would cheat?	Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.	Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.	Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
To peace on earth, Major.	Peace on earth.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.	Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
It was a honest mistake, sir.	I presume the planes are armed?	I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.	Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?	That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.	And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?	Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?	What the hell is Plan-R?	Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.	Why can't you cancel it?	Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.	And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.	Mister President, to guard against espionage, the three letter of the code group for Plan-R are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself, just before each mission.  They are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy.  In this case the deputy is air-borne with the Wing, and General Ripper refuses to recall the planes.
How soon until the enemy finds out what's going on?	We estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes.	How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?	Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.	Then there's no chance for recall?	I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
General Jack D. Ripper, sir.	I want to talk to General Ripper.	But we can't communicate with the base.
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.	Admiral Buldike?
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing.	That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
We don't operate like you KGB boys.	Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?	They're coming in now.	How long will it take to receive them all?	I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.	How many planes did we lose?	I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.	General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?	Naturally I am, sir.	He says they've only shot down three planes.	Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---	Look, he's there, and you're here.	Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.	Hello, are you still there?...Uh-huh...I'll be right back.  We're still working this thing out.
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?	"Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not ""Buck"" Schmuck!"
Yes?	"Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the ""Leper Colony"", failed to receive the recall."	Have you tried the recall again?	Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.	What's the target.	Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?	If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.	General, stick to the point, please.	Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.	Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.	No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.
Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.	Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.	Roger. One-three-eight.
Roger, maintain.	Lothar, take your checks now.
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.	Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?	I don't think so.
All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.	Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.	You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.	Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
What else could it be?	Maybe it's an exercise.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.	They must have clobbered some of our cities already!	He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.	The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
Maximum ECM.	Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
Then this is it.	What?	War.	War?
I'm sorry, Major Kong.  I guess I was way out of line.	Forget it, Quentin.  It can happen to the best of us.  Now let's get squared away.
A through H is correct.	Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.	Check.	Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Check.	Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.	Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
Just the missiles.	They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.	Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.	Speed?	Between Mach 3 and 4.	Call them every five miles.	Thirty-five, still straight.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.	Maximum ECM!
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.	We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.	Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
Why can't he help me now?  He's sitting two feet away from me!	Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?	Look, I'm shot - it hurts.	Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.	Look, can't someone help me?
Roger.	Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.	They must have made a visual contact.	Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.	They can't touch us at this height.	They're moving apart.
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.	I think they mean business.	Hang on, boys.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.	Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.	Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.	Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.	Sure, I'll take her up right now.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.	Yeah?	I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, Plan-R.
Wing attack, Plan-R.  That's exactly what it says.	Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.	That's what I'm doing, and it comes out the same.
No, this looks like the real thing.	Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?	Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.	Primary target the ICBM base at Laputa. One weapon fused for air burst at ten thou- sand.  Second weapon to be used if first malfunctions.  Otherwise the secondary gets it - the airfield outside of Karnak.  Fused air burst at ten thousand.
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?	Ready, Major.
Primary arming switch.	Primary arming switch.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.	Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
So am I.	Listen, I think I'm hit bad.	Where'd they get you?	Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
What does it look like?	Some kind of signaling.	No kidding.	Let's see...International Morse, I think ...K...E...O...P...E...R...E...C...A...L... L...M...I...S...T...A...K...E...O...P...E... Gee, I don't know, it seems to be some kind of code.
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.	Very interesting.
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.	Forget it.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---	Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  Any questions?	I've got one.	Shoot, Lothar.	Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?	That's what I said.	Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.	What's your point, Lothar?	Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.	Are you saying our order don't make sense?	Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
Check target approach.	Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.	Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.	When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?	As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?
Primary circuit is live.	Primary trigger switch.
Release first safety.	First safety.
Second safety.	Seond safety.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.	Check, ten thousand air burst.
Master safety.	Master Kong.
Primary bomb is live.	All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.	Master safety on.
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?	Everything still checks out okay.	Binky?
Yes, Major.	Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.	"Can't ""Ace"" help you?"	He's dead.	What happened?	I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???	Sure!  Sure, I'm on my way.
Where'd they get you?	In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
How do you know he's dead?	Hell, he looks dead.
He's dead, all right.	Listen, give me a shot quick!
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.	Quentin, how's your gear?
"No, look!  It's ""OPE - Recall Mistake."""	Recall what mistake?	"No, I think it means, ""Recall period Mistake,"" and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?"
You sure have to hand it to those guys.	What do you mean?	I mean pulling a stunt like that.	What are you talking about?
What do you mean?	Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.	"Wait a minute, Major.  ""OPE,"" that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?"	You tell me.	They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.	Why should they call us back?	How the hell do I know?  Maybe the war's over.
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?	Look, this is different.	Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.	But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.	Then that settles it, doesn't it?	Like hell it does.	The CRM-114 is smashed, right?	Right.  So how could we get any messages?	That's the point.	I don't get you, King.	I said that's the point!	Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.	Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???	Take it easy, Major Kong.	Then get off my back!
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.	But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.	Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?	Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.	Okay, how do we know they didn't shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew?  How do we know that?
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?	You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.	First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.	Sorry, King.	Forget it.  Okay, team, let's break it up and get ready for the kick-off.
Who's that?	It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?	I'm okay.  What's up?	Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.	Are you sure?	Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.	Maybe the warning system's out.	But I get a red light.	Have you tried the emergency system?	I tried everything.  Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?	But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.	I asked you a question, Lothar!	But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?	Let me check.	There's no other way, boys.  I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.	Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?	Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.	Roger.
We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.	What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
I thought I'd go along for the ride.	Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?	I thought maybe you'd like some company.
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?	I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.	Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.	Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?	Forget it.	I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.	Sure, King.	Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
At the bottom of mines?	Yes.  The radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep.
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.	But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!	Mister President, man is an amazingly adaptable creature.  After all, the conditions would be far superior to those, say, of the Nazi concentration camps, where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.	But who would be chosen?	A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.	But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?	Certainly not, sir.  When they go down into the mine, everyone else will still be alive.  They will have no shocking memories, and the prevailing emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.	Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?	I don't know.
We are?	Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
Mn-hm.	"""Burger Manifesto, Part One"" is gonna make people think?"
Um-hm.	Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.	I don't anymore.	Can I have some?	Knock yourself out.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.	Yeah.	"Did you ever hear that saying, ""This too shall pass""?"	Sure, all the time, in Group.	In Group?	Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.	Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.	Intense.	How long were you in there?	Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.	Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?	No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.	I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.	Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.	It was pretty bad, huh?	It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.	Yeah.	Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.	Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.	Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.	Yeah, I guess.	You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.	Mm-hm.	"You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. ""Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?"" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result."
That was really great.	Was it okay?	Yeah!	What did you guys think?	Slides go with it.	Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
"It's called ""Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone."" Isn't that a great title?"	Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Uh-huh.	I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Responsibility, progress.	Yes.
Typical male.	Typical male.	Typical male.	Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Uh, home, you know.	Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.	You didn't get me in trouble.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?	No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?	Yeah, when's he coming?
Hey!	Hey. Do you have a cigarette?	No I quit.	Hey, you said you did a video?	Yup.	What's it about?	It's really not about anything.	Oh. Well, what's it on?	A cloud.	A cloud?	Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.	Oh.	I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.	Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.	You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?	Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.	Your a nurse?	No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.	Any gunshot victims?	Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.	Sounds like a bummer.	Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.	Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?	Right now?	Yeah.	I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?	Do you wanna go to the van?	Now?	Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?	I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.	Okay, whatever you want.
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.	Needs some pizza in his diet.
Oh yeah? Oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? Federal Express? Hm? By the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. Total waste. Cheese be stuck to the cardboard.	Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.	Yo, your gettin' me all upset here.	"You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, ""Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out."" My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile."
Your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.	Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.	Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.	And your mom.	No, I'm here. Where are you?	Where are you-hoo?	No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.	Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?	Shut up! Aw...
Stuck with what guy?	What?	You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?	No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.	It's your birthday?	Yeah.	Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?	He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
Pony's coming here to the corner?!	Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
I don't know. Later. I don't know.	Yes!
Don't let 'em fight.	The dude wants it.
No, I seriously doubt that Pony's gonna be in a limo.	That's the rock star thing.	No, no.	Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!	Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.	Sorry.	Jesus Christ.	You wanna bet he's with a girl?	No, he's not with a girl.	Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!	You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.	Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?	I'd get bored.	I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.	That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?	Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.	That sounds so depressing.	Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!	No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.	Ah!	I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.	Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.	Watch out for that tree.
A long, long, long, long, while.	Okay, okay.	A long, long, long...	Okay.
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?	So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
Go!	... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
You know what we should do? Go to the...	So you can do an album cover?
Fuck it!	You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.	In the limo!!!
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?	No, no.	Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, long, long night.
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?	No.
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?	No, no, I wasn't trying.	She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.	No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.	No. Life is too short.	No, I'm not worried.	Good.	Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?	Sure.	No, I mean, no one.	Hey, you know me.	Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.	Yeah.	Uh, last night...	Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.	No, no.	I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...	No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?	Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.	Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?	No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.	No.	Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...	Buff, listen to me. Could you just-	But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.	Buff, can you listen to me for a second?	Oh, and guess who showed up.	No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.	I know, man.	You know?	Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?	What, they're looking for her?	No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?	Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?	Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.	Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.	Y- s-sure it did.	No. It didn't, Buff.	Wait. Hey, man.	Erica is in the van back there.	What?	Look.	Hey, man.	She's in the van.	What she doin' in the van, man?	Buff...	What?	She's dead.	She's dead?	Look, Tim confessed to me last night.	Tim...	Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.	Bullshit.	No, no, no.	That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.	Oh, really? You wanna go look?	Yeah, man.	Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!	It's bullshit. Look! Look!
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!	Guess not.	See, I wasn't making shit up, man.	No.	God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.	Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
Ah, you know people there?	I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.	Jeff! Let's go!
Hey, I'm Sooze.	Yeah, right, publicist.
Yeah.	Come on.	Play it! Come on!
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.	Wait, what happened to the tree?
Hey, come on, man! Limo!	Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
Really?	You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.	You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
Come on man.	Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
"Pony? What's a ""pony""? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?"	"Oh, Pony's band ""Dream Girls""? Been on the road opening for ""Midnight Hore"". Stadiums, man.  Wait, so Pony's coming by here?"
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.	So, how was the ride, kids?	Great.	Really?
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.	Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Hey, man.	Hey.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.	Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?	Oh, you were in the band?	Yeah.
Your his publicist?	Sure I am. It's fun.	Mm. And your like, what else?
What do you mean? His girlfriend?	Well, that's one way of putting it.	Am I fucking him?	Shit.	Pony, what would you say our relationship is?
So, then, you're, like, available?	In what way?	Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
Buff.	Buff is funny. God.
Yes! Free concert!	Alright, Pony!
Hey! Hey.	I'm so burnt-out.	Oh, how did you get burnt-out?	Playing with something really hot. Yeah.	Yeah?
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?	Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.	Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.	I can come visit?	You better! Yes!	I will.	It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
Score! Yeah!	Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
He paid you man.	You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.	Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
Hey, we're just having a conversation.	This is private property, my friend.
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.	We're your customers. We're not complaining.	Please!
It's safe, come on.	That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.	Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!	Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.	No, you don't belong here. We were here before you.
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.	Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.	Are you talking to me?	It's okay.	Glad it's okay.	I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.	Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.	In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.	Good. See you later.	You're a drunk and an idiot.	You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.	"Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: ""Either the salt is rotten or the meat."""
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.	Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!	Oh, you were there?	No, but I heard it was great.	Oh, thanks. Thanks.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?	Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.	Oh, So what about her?
Yeah, we're all above that.	See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...	Well, play it, man.
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.	Please.	I just started it.
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...	Don't drop the guitar, man.
Whoa!	No, no, whoa!
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.	Hey, thanks, man.
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.	No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
Thanks. See man?	You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
You make videos?	Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.	"You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, ""Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."""	"""Closed, closed, closed."" But with your music."	You could do it.	I could.	Yeah!	Yeah.	I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?	Yes!	Yeah!	A reel?
You okay, man? You okay?	I didn't want to eat this much, man.	Wait, I'll get you some air.
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.	Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
Thanks, man!	I'll be in the car, okay?
What's up guys?	Uh, you know, just admiring the scenery, you know?
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.	Okay, come on. Time to slow down.	Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.	Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.	Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?
Will you stand up for me?	Okay.	Come on. Inside.	Okay. We'll go for a ride.
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?	It's nice here. It's different.	Yeah, totally.  So, uh, what do they interview you about?
Hi.	Hi.	So you, like, come from a town like this or...?	"No, not really. I come from an ""area"". Bel Air."	You rich?	No, not really. Middle-class.	Oh, me too. Middle-class.	Maybe upper-middle-class.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.	He is?	Yes.	He is.	He is.	And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.	What'd he get you?	A Porsche.	Mm.	Yeah. So, what about you?	What about me? I don't have a car.	You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?	Military marching bands.	You think I'm rich and you hate me.	Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.	I'd like to.	Oh, yeah?	Mm-mm.
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.	Really?	Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.	Mm.	"""It's not a job, it's an adventure."" Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man."	You cut off your little finger?	Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.	Let's see.
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?	What was your name again?	Erica.	Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?	Deep down. Way down.	It's a mistake to think that.	We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.	It's nice to do a lot of things.	That's what I mean.	I'm not a nice guy.	I know. It's okay.	Yeah?	Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.	No, no, see, you, you don't understand.	Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?	Taking care of business.	I'm sorry.
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?	Oh, sure.	Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.	Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.	Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.	Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.	Oh, wow.	I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.	We were?	Oh, yeah, it was a great show.  You guys missed it.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.	Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Mm.	He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.	I'd love to read that.	Funny shit, man.
Hi.	Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.	Hi, I'm Erica.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.	Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
Um, mother-daughter.	Pony and I are friends.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.	It does look good.
It's coming along.	Thank you.
Erica, you coming?	Mm-mm.
Two-fifty.	Two-fifty? They go up?	Always two-fifty, my friend.
Can you tell me what happened?	He's drunk.	Uh-huh.	He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.	Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.	What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.	Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.	Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.	Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?	Because I'm alienated.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.	Who were you talking to?	Nobody. Sooze.
Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?	No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.	Sooze wants to see him.	Well, you know, I wanna fucking see him. I gotta know what it's like to be on MTV.
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.	Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.	Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?	Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.	I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.	Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?	Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.	No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
Tim, what are you talking about?	Ask your girlfriend.
See ya later.	What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
"To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. ""The greatest men are the most alone."" And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom."	I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.	Good. That's good.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?	No.	Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.	What?	Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?	Yeah, fuck 'em.	No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!	Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.	No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.	What? What'd you do?	That chick, Erica?	Well, w-what happened?	"Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, ""Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!"" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really..."	What'd you do?	I hit her.	You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?	Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.	Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?	Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.	Oh fuck.
They let you out?	Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.	You lied to me.	You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.	No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.	Wow. You did that for me?	Yes.	Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.	Why? Because I give a shit?	Oh, shit.	Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?	Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?	Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.	I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.	You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.	Good, good. I, I hope he does.	The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.	Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?	I don't know.	You don't know?	No.	Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?	No.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.	What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.	Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.	Just go home, alright?	This is my home.	Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.	They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.	They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?	What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.	Will you just put the gun down?	No.	Just put it down.
Jeff, stay there.	He's got a gun. He's got a gun.	Well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops and I'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out.
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?	That, that's Indian?
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.	Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Jeff! Come up here!	Is that Bee-Bee?	Come on!
What?	Seven-twenty.	I gave it to you.
Why we're just standing here.	Look, your trespassing.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...	I don't know.	You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.	Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.	Oh, it's very complicated, huh?	That's right.	Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?	Look, why do you care, huh?	Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.	Okay. Nazeer, okay?	Nazeer what?	Nazeer Chaudry!
Please?	Look, look, just get off my property.
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?	I don't know. I think she's breathing.	Okay. Okay, look my wife called the police. They're coming. It's not too late. They'll come, they'll take care of her. I'm going inside.
God, I haven't seen you all day.	You could've come over.	I know, I know, I know.
Oh! Trim it!	I hate that.	Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.	No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.	Okay, so maybe later.
Was that supposed to be me?	No.	Yes.
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.	Man?	Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.	It's a piece.	Your sure as hell right about that.	I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
"""The worst I can do is starve to death."" Listen to you."	I don't want to hear it anymore.	No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.	Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.	Oh, well, then you better listen to him.	Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.	So you can give me more shit?	No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?	I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
Yes, you asshole.	About what?	About things that are important to me.	Like what?	Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
Of course I do!	Name one.	God, KAREN JOHNSON.	One!	Your completely missing the point.	Hey!	I'm talking about idealism.
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.	No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.	No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.	But do you stand for anything?	Yes, I stand for -	What? What do you stand for?	I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!	Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.	Can I talk here? Let me talk.	You know, all you know is what's good for you.	Can I talk?	Typical male.
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?	Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?	Um, because you didn't want to go.	Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.	Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
This is ridiculous!	Tim!
It was a racial incident.	It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?	It got that close.	Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.	Oh, yeah?	Yeah.	Okay, what would you have done.	I would've stopped it.	How?	I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...	Jeff. Jeff.	... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.	Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.	Sooze.
What?	Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?	What feelings?	Us.	Of course.	And?	Come with me.	No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?	So what do you wanna do?	Nothing.	No one does nothing, Jeff.	Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.	New ground?	Mm-hm.	Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?	Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?	My goal is to make art.	So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?	Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?	Mm-mm.	So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?	No, no.	So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?	I don't know.
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.	Mm.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.	Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.	No, I don't.	Yes, you do.	No, I don't.	You do.	No, I don't.
FUCK! Pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would've gone to your concert!	Jeff!	So you sold ninety thousand units. So what? Does that mean you're a genius? You're a great artist? You're higher up the ladder? You got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?
Come on.	No. No, no, no.	Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.	No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.	Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.	Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.	No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.	Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.	But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.	What?	No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.	Mm-hm.	And I fig- and I figured something out.	Oh, yeah?	I, yeah.	Mm.
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.	God, you smell like whiskey.	No, no, I have to talk to you.	Is that a threat?
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?	I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.	Where are you going?	For a ride.	Wait, away?	Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.	To his hotel?	Shit, Jeff!
I've run out of words.	Wait. What, what are you saying?	I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.	Well, what about us?	What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.	No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.	Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?	Oh, no, no, no.	You're unbelievable.	Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.	You did, huh? Good for you.	Oh, fuck it, man!
Do your covers and all that shit.	'Bye, Jeff.	Go.	What?	Just go.
You really suck, you know that?	Just go.
Hey, Pony.	Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?	Good, man.	Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.	Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?	Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...	No, it's not...	Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?	Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.	Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.	Yeah.	We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.	Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?	Nah, nah, nah, nah.	Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.	Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?	Yeah.	The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?	Yeah, I crash there.	Yeah, good.
The prom. That's funny.	Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?	Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.	Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
Sorry.	So how's college?	I dropped out. I mean, uh, you know, this semester I'm taking a, a class, you know, three nights a week. But I'm just try-trying to think and work on stuff., you know? I've been doing some writing, though. Short pieces, you know.
You know, I've thought about that, actually.	No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
So you think I should?	What?	Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.	Like songs?	Yeah, they could be songs.	Yeah. You should show 'em to me.	Really?	Yeah, really.	Now?	Yeah.
Great.	Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...	Well, not exactly.	For a while.	Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?	No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
So who are you?	What do you mean?	Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?	I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.	Yeah, well, that's what I do too.	What?	Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?	Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?	Of course it does.
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.	You know what I'm saying?
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.	Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...	No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.	Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?	No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.	Why don't you come with us, man? I mean, I want to hear about those songs you've been working on. You too, Buff.
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?	Oh, yeah.	I'm sorry. I, I gotta...	Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.	Burnfield. No place like it.
Hey, where's Erica?	I don't know.
I don't know.	I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.	Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?	No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.	Well, what about this?
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.	Camel jockey.	You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.	Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.	Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.	Please. Look...
Look, get down off my property.	Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?	Get off my property!	Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.	Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.	Go ahead! They love you just about as much as I do.
Look Pakeesa...	Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?	Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!	You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
Get off my roof!	Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!	Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming.
Ready?	What are you saying?
I hope you're happy!	This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.	No, this has everything to do with you.	No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.	Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem.  Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay.  You're fucked now, pal!  Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay.  Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck.  Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
Pony, oh my god!	Hey!	You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!	Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.	Is that your driver?	It's stupid.	No, no, it isn't. It's cool.	Look at you!	Oh!	Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?	Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.	Oh, yeah?	So? What's L.A. like?	It's pretty exciting.	Yeah?	Yeah.	Like?	Oh, uh... uh, the other night our manager Danny took us to this restaurant and there was Sandra Bernhard.	No, she was just sitting there?!	Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.	You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.	New York, huh?	Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.	You have to go. You always did such, uh, you know, great work. I still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.	You do not!	I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.	Hey.
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?	Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.	Yeah?	Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.	You do not want me to do your cover.	I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.	You're not serious.	I'm always serious.	Oh they'd never let me do what I want.	I get final approval. It's in my contract.	Would I get paid?	Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.	Yeah?	Yeah.	Oh, God, that would be something I really want to do.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.	Yeah.	And you know why it's so good? See, because, see, you guys are real. No, man, I mean it. You guys have a sense of humor. You live your lives, you know. It's simple, you know. The guys on the road, I mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks... and Danny, all Danny talks about is money.
Yeah, come on, play it.	Oh, no, man. I can't.
Alright, alright already.	Alright!
"""Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while""  Chorus here.  ""You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"""	That was so great!
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.	Mine too.
Jesus, Jeff.	Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.	No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I...
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!	You done?
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.	I can't believe you're still here.	I'm moving.	If...	No, I'm going.	Mm-hm.
Soon.	Yep.	What's that supposed to mean?	I don't know. I say what I mean.	Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.	That's because I am.
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.	Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.	Yeah.	I think about you. I mean, a lot.	Me?	Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.	Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.	Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?	Yeah, I know what you're saying.	You do?	Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
Is that Jeff?	Oh, my god!
You know, my mom has this saying.	Yeah?	"""Don't write any checks you can't cash."""	Really? What else does your mother say?
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?	I think I gotta go.
What the fuck are you talking about?!	Nobody's fucking anybody!
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.	Where do you get your ideas?
"""See what's around you listen to their lies"""	So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.	"""I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"""
Tim?	Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
Where's Erica? You seen her?	Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.	Oh, How'd she get back?	I called Bucky's. I got her a cab. Is there any hot mustard?
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.	What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.	Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.	Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.	Yeah? Well, what'd she say?	About what?	About where she went. I mean, what bar?	She didn't say. Maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.	The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?	Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.	Whatever.	Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?	Don't do that, man, okay?
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?	It's none of my business?	Yeah.	Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.	Don't do that.	What are you going to do? Hm?	If you hit me...	Yeah?	... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?	Your manager?	Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.	Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?	Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?	Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?	Just one?	Yeah.
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?	Uh, eleven twenty-five.
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?	It's not the air force anymore, Scuff	So where are you?	I'm here.
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.	At least I have a point of view, you know?
Seriously? It's a great idea.	Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.	I did. I split, man. I expanded my horizons, you know. Served my country. Saw the world, you know? I've gained wisdom and now I'm back, baby, back from the road. Me and Jack Kerouac.
Why don't you go back to where you came from?	Hey, Tim.	No, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite 'cause I can fuckin' smell him from here. You know what? Tow words, man: roll on.
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.	Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.	Fucking drunk, huh?	You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Hey, your gonna regret this.	Come on, Jeff.
Leave him alone, Tim.	Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.	Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.	Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.	Jeff!
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!	Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.	Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.	Oh that's nice for you.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.	"There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: ""Don't write any checks you can't cash""."
Could you give me a ride?	Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.	Tim, go throw up somewhere.
I'm going out later.	No car.	The fuck not?	You know the fuck not.	Fuck.	Don't swear it's impolite.
Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!	Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
What?!	You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.	You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!	I just pulled and it - it came off.	This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!	Look, it's really not my fault.
Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!	Sorry, Kansas...	NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!	"Oh for Chrissakes...  ""White trash Betty.""  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway."	"Well, use your head, ""Stalker Betty."""
Holy shit.	You just became a statistic!
I'm in, too.	Cleo!	Kansas is right.  We're like sisters -- we're closer than sisters.  And you don't turn your back on family.
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.	Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.	Conan went to Harvard.
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!	It's twins!!
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!	Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Another sex dream?	Wayne Gretzky.
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.	Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --	Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?	Well...uh...they, y'know, uh... They had nicknames.
Di, we're sorry.  We...	It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?	Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.	My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?	I personally think of how Conan started as a writer, then became a...
Hello?	Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.	Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.	Bye.
Diane?  Diane!	Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!	No...I've been pregnant.
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.	No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.	Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.	You sure?	Positive.	"""Positive"" you're sure I'm not fat or ""positive"" I'm..."
"Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a ""pregnancy insanity.""  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --"	"Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, ""Dreams can come true.""  Right?"
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.	And they get caught!	That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
No.	If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?	... I don't know.  Probably not.	So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.	Well...
But, we have to make a smart plan!	Of course - of course!  Hands in...
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.	Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.	That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
"Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to ""fuck me up!""  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to ""fuck me up?"""	She thinks you went to the police.	WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?	I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
Hi, Jack.	Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
"... so when your dad said, ""I never want to see your ""f-'in' faces again!"" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?"	I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.	Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?	Spit from your dad?	I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.	Yeah.	"So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty ""stinky"" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this."	Y'think?	I sure do.	Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.	Oh, Jack...
Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two.	But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
"Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, ""Tricks are for kids!""  And you think, ""I'm a kid, I guess they're for me.""  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain."	Jack...	If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?	Trix...	Me too!  Will it ever end?!  I love this lady!
Jack, I think I should get a job.	But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...	I know, but that was before.	Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!	Mmm-hmmm...
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over.	Huh?  Oh Jesus...
Uh, Jack - look, I can explain...	Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
"...so although their dad said, ""Don't get out of the car until I get back with help,"" they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  ""Run to my voice - and don't look back.""  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!"	That was gas, Sweetie.	Oh... What are you working on?	Jus some girlie things for the squad.
I'm sorry.	What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...	Let me explain something...	No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!	Uh, yes.  Yes you did.
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.	Sorry.  My hands are tied.
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.	Well, I want to know what happened --
Nope.  Sounds more like the first.	"I'll just ask the question myself... ""Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"""
Madonna.	We're here for you, Diane.
Hat-trick?	He is the Great One...
"""No"" you're not sure or ""No"" I'm not fat?"	"Uh, ""no""... You're not fat."	You sure I'm not fat?
Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...	Stop, you're gonna make me cry.	And if the O.J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money.  Your mom only shot a guy...
Shut up.	Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
Kansas!	I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...	Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!	Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...	"We were told you could ""fix us up."""
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!	Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
Oh no...	He Ikea'd us.
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!	Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.	She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.	That you?	Yeah, hold on.	Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.	Don't use big bills!	For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
Yeah?	Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...	Hello?	Kim-Lo?	No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.	Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!	Wrong number  Nooooooo!
Yeah?	I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.	Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?	Ammo?	Bullets.	Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it.	Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.  Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.	Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it.
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.	You're kidding.	Fern!  C'mere!  She's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose.
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?	I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
"I-I didn't mean to say ""whore,"" Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head."	"I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself ""with child,"" unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... ""Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby."" The great one..."
You want us to help you pick up?	Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.	Or, I could get my own horse...	Or that!  Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby.  I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand.  I could open that safe in my sleep!
Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School.	That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.
Hello?	We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.	Hannah, we've...	It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!	Ooops, hold on a sec.
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...	Hold on...
Screw Lucy!	Kansas?
Is that you down there?	Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.	Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?	Oh yeah, you caught us...
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.	Thanks!  That'd be great.
You got that big retarded girl down there?	Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.	Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?	"I'll get them before ""Touched by an Angel,"" don't worry."	You damn well better...
Really...	"Yeah.  ""Itchy"" sent us."	She did, did she?  How is the old girl?	Definitely old.	That's Itchy, alright.  How many y'need?
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!	Maybe we can make a deal.
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.	Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.	"Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with ""at church camp"" ain't leading to the big ""O."""
Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!	But you're not married.
...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes...	Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!	"I'm only allowed ""G"" movies."	"Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched ""Dog Day Afternoon!"""
You sure you wanna go there?	Uh...maybe?	"'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say ""Fat-assed lesbian!"""
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.	Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
All of you!	Bank branch!
Bank branch!	All of you!
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.	Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.	I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.	They could kill you.	So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...	I don't hate you.  I need your help.	My what?	Your help.	Now how the hell can I help you?	Okay, you can't tell anybody.	Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?	My best friend got pregnant.	Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.	Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...	I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.	So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.	"Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, ""P.S. My mom's a dyke"" too?"	What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!	"Hey, don't ""mouthy shit"" me - I'm outta here."	Wait, Petunia.  Mommy's a little amped up - didn't get her yard time this morning.  Mink ain't my bitch.  She's a specialist... in banks.
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.	More proof God's a guy...	...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!	Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.	Stop it!  This is crazy!
What the hell do you want?	I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.	I'm terribly sorry, Mr. de Mille.
It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?	I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...	Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?	I didn't mean to --	Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.	I hear she was a terror to work with.	She got to be.  A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit.  Hold everything.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.	You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.	Roll 'em.	Action! The scene starts.
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !	Hi, Artie.	Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?	In a deep freeze.	I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons.  Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
Give me your coat.	Let it ride for a while.	You're going to stay, aren't you?	That was the general idea.	Come on.
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?	Close, but no cigar.
Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?	Where's the bar?
Good party.	The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.	Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
Sure, this'll go on all night.	I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?	It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.	I'll take it.	I'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage.
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?	Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?	I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?	Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.	I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.	What's wrong with it?	It's from hunger.	Nothing for Ladd?	Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.	I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
This is Miss Kramer.	Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
Name dropper.	I just think pictures should say a little something.
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.	Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
If I could be of any help...	I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.	Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.	That was last year.  This year I'm trying to earn a living.	So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.	Sure.  Bases Loaded.
Hurt feelings department.	About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
You forgot this.	Thanks.	I've been hoping to run into you.	What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?	I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.	Why, you sweet kid.	There's one called....Window... something with a window.	Dark Windows.  How did you like it?	I didn't.	Thank you.	Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
Is there someplace we can talk?	How about the Rainbow Room?
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.	The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.	I had a teacher like that once.	Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...	Who wants true? Who wants moving?	Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.	Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.	I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.	I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?	As for instance?	Well....	We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?	How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?	Are you hungry?	Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --	Phillip, you're mad!
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.	O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.	You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.	You'll be waiting for me?	With a wildly beating heart.	Life can be beautiful!
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.	You don't know how glad I am to see youl
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.	I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.	I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.	Is that so? What's the wonderful news?	Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.	What teacher?	Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.	You did?	He thinks it could be made into something.	Into what? A lampshade?	Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck.  They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
O.K.  Where's the cash?	Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.	I was afraid of that.	I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.	I tell you this is half sold.	As a matter of fact.  I've given up writing altogether.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.	Sorry if I crossed you up.	You sure have.	So long.
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.	Well, for heaven's sake!
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.	Why should you do that?	If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.	You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.	What about all those ideas you had?	See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.	Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.	This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.	Check.	Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...	I'll make it short.	Sorry.  It's your baby now.	I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.	I'm all tied up.  I can't.	Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.	What has Artie to do with it.	We're engaged.	Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.	I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.	It's just impossible.	Nobody can be that busy.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.	You're tough, all right.	You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.	Honest to goodness, I hate you.	And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.	Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.	So do I.	Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
Oh, you --	And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
Good.	What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.	I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.	It will?	Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.	Don't you sometimes hate yourself?	Constantly.  No, in all serious- ness, it's really good.  It's fun writing again.  I'm happy here, honest I am.
Who's Norma?	Who's who?	I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.	Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.	I'll say.  This is solid gold.	I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.	It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.	That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.	What were you -- a child actress?	I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.	Second generation, huh?	Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.	Nice job.	Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.	Saddest thing I ever heard.	Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...	Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...	Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.	Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.	If you please.
May I say you smell real special.	It must be my new shampoo.	That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?	Twenty-two.	That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two.  Now may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ...  Now back to the typewriter.
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?	Was I?  I'm sorry.	What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?	Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.	Why not?	I just don't.	What is it you've heard.  Come on, let's have it.
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.	It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.	From Artie.  What's wrong?	He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.	Why don't you? We can finish the script by Thursday.
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.	I don't want it now.	Why not? Don't you love Artie?	Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.	What happened?	You did.
Hello, Betty.	I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?	Come on in, Betty,
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.	This is where you live?	You bet.	Whose house is it?
Hers.	Whose?	Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.	That was Norma Desmond on the phone?	Want something to drink?  There's always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.	Why did she call me?	Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
Her own movie theatre.	I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?	I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?	No.	All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.	No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.	All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?	Come on, Joe.	Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?	If you love me, Joe.	Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.	Joe, I can't look at you any more.	Nobody asked you to.
Hello, young fellow.	Hello, Mr. deMille.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.	Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.	You'd better.  I'm very angry.	I'm pretty busy, as you can see...	That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?	Yes, I did.	Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.	What assistant?	Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.	Gordon Cole?	And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.	Gordon Cole... Look, Norma, I'm in the middle of a rehearsal.  Make yourself comfortable.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?	You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.	I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
What's the matter, Norma?	Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.	We've missed you too, dear.	We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.	That's what I want to talk to you about.	It's a good script, isn't it?	It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...	I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.	Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.	But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
I wouldn't know.	I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.	Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.	It is not.  Get out.	I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.	Get out.	Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
Or shall I call my servant?	I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.	I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.	I knew there was something wrong with them.	They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...	That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.	Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl	Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.	You are! Writing words, words! You've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.	Get out!
Just a minute, you!	Yeah?	You're a writer, you said.	Why?
Are you or aren't you?	I think that's what it says on my driver's license.	And you have written pictures, haven't you?	Sure have.  The last one I wrote was about cattle rustlers. Before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out.	Or teach it a better tune.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?	Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.	This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.	Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.	It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.	Uh-huh.
We've made a lot of pictures together.	And you'll play Salome?	Who else ?	Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.	I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.	Fair enough.	Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.	They'll love it in Pomona.	They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!	Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.	I am not afraid.  Read it!
Well?	This is fascinating.	Of course it is.	Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.	I wrote that with my heart.	Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.	What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.	It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.	I will not have it butchered.	Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.	Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?	I don't know.	What month?	December twenty-first.	Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.	Thank you.	I want you to do this work.	Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.	I don't care.
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.	I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.	Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -	Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.	It's getting kind of late --	Are you married, Mr.  -- ?	The name is Gillis.  I'm single.	Where do you live?	Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.	There's something wrong with your car, you said.	There sure is.	You can stay here.	I'll come early tomorrow.
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.	Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.	You'll like it here.	Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.	You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.	I'll take care of that.	It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.	I'm used to paying my own bills.	You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.	Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.	Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.	Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.	Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
What's that?	Just a scene I cut out.	What scene?	The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -	Cut away from me?	Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.	They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.	Okay.
I want to talk to you for a minute.	Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.	They've come for my car.	Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.	I need some money right now.	Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?	I've lost my car.	Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.	It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!	Now you're being silly.  We don't need two cars.  We have a car.  And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit.  An Isotta-Fraschini.  Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschinis?  All hand-made.  Cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.	What's wrong with It?	Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !	I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --	Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
How about some evening clothes?	I don't need a tuxedo.	Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.	Tails.  That's ridiculous.	You'll need them for parties. You'll need them for New Year's Eve.  Where are your evening clothes?
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!		Come on!
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.	Come here!
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.	I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.	Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.	Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
Shouldn't we wait for the others?	Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!	Just follow me.
Don't bend back like that.	It's those feathers.  They tickle.
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?	Who?	The other guests?	There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.	I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself.  He was afraid of catching cold.
Hold me tighter.	Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?	You think this is all very funny.	A little.	Is it funny that I'm in love with you?	What's that?	I'm in love with you.  Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.
What are the notes?	"""Mad about the boy."""	Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.	Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.	Keep it.	I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.	Cut out that us business.
What's the matter with you?	What right do you have to take me for granted?	What right? Do you want me to tell you?	Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?	Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?	Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --	What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you.  Is that it?
Go away.	What kind of a silly thing was that to do?	To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.	It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.	Great stars have great pride.
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.	Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.	Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --	Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.	I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
You're really going to send it to De Mille?	This is the right day.
Did she read the script?	DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.	I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.	When did he say it, Norma?	So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
Have one of mine.	They're awful.  They make me cough.	Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.	You're a darling.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.	I ran into some people I knew.	Where are my cigarettes?	Where are your...?
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?	Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.	All right.  Give me this.  I need it for a moustache.  Now close your eyes.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.	Maybe deMille is shooting.	I know that trick! He wants to belittle me.  He's trying to get my price down.  I've waited twenty years for this call.  Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready.
Don't you want to come along, darling?	I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.	Thank you, darling.
How did it go?	It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
He must be quite a guy.	He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.	Yes, Norma.
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.	Good night.	I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.	Good.	I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.	Good.	You'd better get to bed yourself.	I think I'll read a little.	You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?	Why do you say that?	I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?	I went for a walk.	No you didn't.  You took the car.	All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?	Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.	I haven't done anything, Norma.	Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't let you.
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?	Yes, I am, Norma.	No, you're not.  Max! Max!	Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.	It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.	And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.	These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?	Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.	You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.	That's between you and yourself, Norma.	You think I made that up about the gun...
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!	Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.	You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel	Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
That's a lie!  They still want me!	No, they don't.	What about the studio? What about De Mille?	He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.	Wanted what?	De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.	That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!	You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.	That isn't true! Max?
You heard him.  I'm a star!	Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.	I'm the greatest star of them all.	Goodbye.  Norma.	No one leaves a star.  That makes one a star.
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --	Go on in.
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --	Wipe your feet!
You are not dressed properly.	Dressed for what?
Suppose you listen just for a minute -	Madame is waiting.	For me?  Okay.
I made your bed this afternoon.	Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
This room has not been used for a long time.	It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.	Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.	She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.	I sure turned into an interesting driveway.	You did, sir.

A stroke maybe. his coat over a chair,   Come to think of it, the walks over to the win-   whole place seemed to have dow, pulls down the      been stricken with a kind of rickety Venetian blind.  creeping paralysis, out of As he does so, he looks  beat with the rest of the down at:                 world, crumbling apart in slow motion ...
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.	Naturally.  I brought them myself.	Is that so!	Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?	Who said you could?  Who asked you to?
Some men are here.  They asked for you.	I'm not here.	That's what I told them.	Good.	They found your car in the garage.  They are going to tow it away.
Whose room was this?	It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.	There are no locks anywhere in this house.
How come?	The doctor suggested it.	What doctor?	Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.	Uh-huh?	We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.	Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.	I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.	You send them.  Is that it, Max?	I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.	No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?	I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
How is she?	She is upstairs.
Mr. Gillis, if you please.	Right with you.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.	That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.	He had a great big bungalow on wheels.  I had the upstairs.  See where it says 'Readers' Department'? I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
What's the matter, Max?	I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.	What?
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?	You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.	How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?	I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...	Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.	It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.	Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?	She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.	You made her a star?	I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.	And she's turned you into a servant.	It was I who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  I could have gone on witn my career, only I found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  You see, I was her rirst husband.
Joseph C. Gillis?	That's right.
We've come for the car.	What car?
Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.	Is that So?	I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.	Had to get away for his health, I suppose.	You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.	Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.	You say the cutest things.
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?	It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.	So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?	More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Got a title?	Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.	Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded.
Oh, you're one of the message kids.  Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.	No, that was me.  I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
Well, seems like Zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.	Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.	Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?	Frankly, no.	Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.	You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.	Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -	Along is no good.  I need it now.	Haven't got a thing.	Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.	There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.	Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?	Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -	Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.	No?	Gillis, get this through your head.  I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent.  I'm your friend.
How's that about your being my friend?	Don't you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  Once a talent like yours gets into that Mocambo- Romanoff rut, you're through.	Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.	Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.	What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.	Maybe what you need is another agent.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?	Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.	Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?	If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?	This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?	Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?	Had he been trying to blackmail you?
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?	Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?	Was theft involved?  Did you catch him trying to steal something, or find he had stolen something?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.	Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
Bring something to drink.	Yes.  Madame.
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.	Yes, Madame.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.	You know better than to interrupt me.	Paramount is calling.	Who?	Paramount studios.	Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.	It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.	Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!	I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.	Say that I'm busy, and hang up.	Very good, Madam.
If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.	Thank you, Max.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?	The cameras have arrived, Madame.	They have?  Thank you, Max.  Tell Mr. DeMille I will be on the set at once.
What is the scene? Where am I?	This is the staircase of the palace.	Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.	All right.  Camera!  Action!
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.	But where?
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.	But the phantom Zone is for criminals.	It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.	How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.	It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.	But what will happen?	The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.	What is it?	The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
What does it mean?	The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?	Softball.
It must be the girls. One of the girls.	But which one?	Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.	And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?	Sorry, mistress.
Is he your entertainment for tonight?	He will be. In about five minutes.	Have fun.
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?	It's what we were warned about.
A Storm Dragon?	No, a super girl.
Why did she have to show up now?	Eliminate her.	That's easy for you to say, Bianca.	You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.	Am I? Still?
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.	I've been saving it. For the right moment.	That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
What do I do?  I don't know her name.	The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.	Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
I think I'd better keep it.	Whatever you say.	Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.
Home?	No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.	Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.	Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
I don't feel like it right now.	She didn't take it from you, did she?	That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.	"There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother."
At last. Ultimate Power.	And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!	What do you mean we?
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.	What do you want?	Western Europe.	I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.	No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
Is this Nigel's doing?	It's a warning, that's for sure.	Maybe it was just an accident.	There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
Wait...don't leave me in here...	It's for your own protection.
What's happening?	I'm taking you to the hospital.	Let me out. I have to talk to you.	Later.
Don't leave me.	I have to.	When can I see, you again ?	Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!	Who didn't?	That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.	You love me?	My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...	We have to have a long talk about all this.	I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
This is my favourite place in the city.	Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?	They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
Like it?	Yes. It reminds me of home.	Where Superman's from? Krypton?	No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.	I'm sorry, I don't understand.	It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.	Come on, let's ride.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.	Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.	Let's talk about us, not her.	Tell me where I can find her.	I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.	I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.	We can't do that.	Why not ?	We're from different worlds.	Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
All this talk about love, it's silly.	You don't like me? You hate me?
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.	What do you feel about me?
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.	What's that?	Let me kiss you.	No.	You're not afraid are you?	Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.	If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.	Well...I guess one is all right.
Is this how?	Terrific.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.	It's paradise . We could be very happy here.	But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.	You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---	Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
She said it wouldn't last.	What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
I don't love you any more.	Just like that?	Like turning off a light.
Away. From you.	But why?	Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.	I sort of like what you said.	That makes it worse.	But I don't understand.
Hi.	Hello. Are you still mad at me?	I'm not mad at you.	It seemed that way to me.	I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.	Miss what?	What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
And now?	And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
You think so?	I don't see why not.	But what if---it wasn't real?	Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?	"Are you asking me for a ""date""?"	Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.	Aren't you forgetting about Selena?	She'll forget about us eventually.
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...	I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?	In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.	I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park.
Wait. Don't leave me.	You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
Before you go...	What?	Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
And you can see how you feel about me, right?	Yes.
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.	She has hostages.
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!	How do I fight it?	Turn it against her.
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.	I'll come back as soon as I can.
She's right. They'll string her up.	Do you want to come to Argo City?
Hey! Ethan!	Hmmm?	Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
A little.	Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.	I'll mention it upstairs.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.	I did.	Well thanks a pile, fella.
Finished your estimate?	Well, there's several ways to go .	Come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.	I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.	I bet they do.	What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.	Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
What is it?	A passionfruit smoothee.	Well, just one.
To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.	I'll drink to that.
Oh no, not you again.	What an adorable hat.	They think I have a concussion.	And you think you're in love.	I know it.	"This ""love"" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion."	Why should I believe you?	It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?	But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.	Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first.
Nurse! Nurse!	You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.	Nurse!	Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.	Nurse! Help !
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.	I don't want your help.	Come back to my house. My car's outside.
No!	I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
I'm wise to your tricks, lady.	I could force you.	If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.	Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.	You vicious--	Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?	Yeah.
Guess! Go on.	I don't know. You seem afraid.	You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?	Supergirl?
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?	Well...I guess I can't.	I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
Why the empty cage?	That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.	Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.	Why George, are you proposing?	Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...	George---I thought you'd never ask.
Hey, where you going?	I've got things to do.	What about my proposal?	Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.	Nice to meet you.
Do you have any theories about last night?	Theories?	How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.	Can I quote you?
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?	He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.	I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?	Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
Can I give you a lift?	Oh, no thanks.	It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
Someone's chasing him.	Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?	Yes.	The scoop of the year!
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?	-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?	Oh, sure.
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!	How do you know?	I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.	Did anybody notice you?	I can't help it if men notice me.	Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.	I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.	I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.	Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.	You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?	You bet your ass.	Why didn't you tell me?	You're supposed to guess.
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.	But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.	It was my fault we lost the Power Source.	Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.	I allowed it to escape the City.
Superman will return it.	Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.	As brave as my father. As wise.
What are you making:	It's going to be a tree, I think.
What's a tree?	It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.	Where is Earth?	Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?	Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.
Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.	I don't understand.	Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
You see, a tree is a living thing.	Can you create life?
I'm sorry... I didn't know.	It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
I can do that.	No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
There isn't any.	This is all your clothes?
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...	Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?	I'd rather not talk about it.	You're not...an orphan are you?	My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.	Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.	Thank you. You're very kind.
She did that deliberately.	She's a beast.
How'd you do that?	Must've been a defective puck.
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.	But what for?	She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
Your hair looks the same.	It was just a trim.
No thanks. You go on.	You sure?
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...	Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.	Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.	It doesn't seem right.	Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?
Why is he acting so strangely?	I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
Lucy; come back!	Somebody's gotta do something!!
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.	Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.	He's nice.	Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?	I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.	Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming.
Don't you believe in knocking?	Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
What can I do for you?	I'm Linda Lee.
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.	Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
No plans for the weekend, Linda?	No, MR. Danvers.	Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?	I'd love to.
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.	What? Me?	Sure. Mate in five moves.
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.	It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.	I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.	You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
I just did. Because I have the Power.	You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.	Cigarette?
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.	You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.	I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
Balefire on you, Selena!	You Scorpios can never take a joke.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.	Throw him out.
Nigel, get lost.	I have to talk to you.	You're wasting your breath.	You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.	I could teach you a thing or two now.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?	I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
Nothing's wrong with my skin.	Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.	We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?	You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.	Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?	Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.	Nonsense.
That was meant for me!	Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
Who are you ?	I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.	I don't scare that easily.
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.	A cheap trick.	Cheap but effective.
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.	It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.	Not yet.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.	For what?
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.	Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
What's it like?	It's the most beautiful place in the universe.	Sounds O.K. to me. Let's go.
Where is inner space?	It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.	Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.	That's home.
What is this place?	This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?	I was on Earth...	Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?	Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
Shouldnt've done that.	...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.	It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---	I know.	Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people.
Others?	Criminals.
"...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."""	What? Palace? Hardly.	Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City...
It's lovely. . .	No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.	Are you happy, Zaltar?	What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.	But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
You look at them? How?	The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
That horrible woman!	Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
Zaltar, please help me.	Of course, my dear. What can I do?	Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.	If there's a way in, there must be a way out.	No, that's not true---there's well...no--
There is a way.	I knew it!	But it's impossible.	Why?	No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
Then teach me how.	No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think.
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.	Then come with me.	Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?	You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.	Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?	Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
You're going to take me back?	Going to try. Didn't say I could.
"I heard my mother ask you once ""how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?"" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart."	Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
You can use the wand.	Better than when I was a child.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.	Don't stop. Keep moving.	Yes, mustn't stop.	It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Zaltar. Use the wand!	Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
Goodbye...	Zaltar!
Yeah? What do you want?	Buddy, are we in trouble.
What?	First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
What are you talkin' about?	Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.	Mr. Roebush?	Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?	Tuesday.	TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?	Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?	Not enough vodka in it.	There's no vodka in it.	Aha! What'd I tell ya!	What? What did you tell me?
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?	Brad.	Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.	Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?	Brad?	No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.	Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?	Nope.  Never.
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --	Brad Wilson.	"Hiya, Kent, long time no see. Not that you ever could.  ""See"" I mean,  Hahaha!"
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?	I seem to be.
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.	Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.	A natural athlete can play any sport. Any sport.
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.	For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.	The kid needs a man to show him --	The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
Lana Lang. How great to see you.	Clark.
You look wonderful.	You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...	And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.	You're welcome...??	For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
"I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  ""Would you dance with me?"""	Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.	The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?	It sure is.	There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
You know what's the problem?	Too much mayonnaise?	Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?	I didn't --	No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.	But Lana, you could --	That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?	Who?	Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
You...um...you never got married?	Oh...I came close once.
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?	You thought that?	"I thought ""Clark Kent has a really nice voice."" You didn't even know I was there."
I just can't stand this.	Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.	It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.	But all he had was chocolate milk.	I mean him.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.	Some people don't think it's healthy.	Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.	Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.	Me??	I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.	There's a lot of choices here.	No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.	I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
Peanut butter and jelly.	No, thanks.	No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.	Well, this pate is rather...unusual.	Pate? What pate?  I didn't make any --  Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's dog food.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.	Me neither...
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --	You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
I can never get a way from it.	Old ties are hard to cut.	No. I mean, yes they are, but I was talking about that.  Wheat King. Bet your bottom dollar that's a Wheat King thresher.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?	Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --	No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?	Call me.	Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean, I'd want to, but I wouldn't want to...be a nuisance to you.
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.	Can I help?
He really was!	Uh-huh.	Well, aren't you excited?	Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.	Me too. That's why I put this one up.
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.	Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.	But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --	Anyday...
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---	Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?	Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.	Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.	Oh. You're going away.
Uh...excuse me, folks...	Kent!	I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
Well...  Not quite like this.	Mom and I do this all the time.
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!	What!
Do you really know Superman?	We get together sometimes.
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?	Sure.	Could you get me Superman's autograph?
Hi. Mister Kent.  Guess who Mom's having dinner with tonight? Superman!	Actually, that's why I stopped by. He's realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?	Say!	Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and make my travel arrangements?	Exactly what I was about to ask about me.
You're the best, Lois.	I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.	Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.	Oh?
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?	I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?	Mmmmm . . .	The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --	What's that?
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!	At one o'clock in the morning?
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?	What are you doing?	You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.
Name?	Gus Gorman.
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?	Yeah.	What kind?	Kitchen. . . Technician	Dishwasher? Any luck?	Nope, but --	Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.	Thirty-five.	Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .	They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!	A television set?	Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.	The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!	"Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? ""Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!"" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet."	Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .	I know, I'm the fault.	Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?	Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!	You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.	What about this week's check?	
Sonofagun! Look at this here!	First paycheck?	First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!	That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.	I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.	What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?	They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.	Who gets it, the company?	No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.	So where is all them half-centses?	They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.
How many sugars?	One.  And a half.
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?	Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.	Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?	Yeah. A raise . .
Gus?	Say what?	The boss wants to see you.	Say who?
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...	Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.	Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
"Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- ""dig where you're comin' from.""  You want to be rich, right?"	Uh...	Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.	Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...	Or socks.	Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.	'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?	I'm tryin' to.
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!	Black or regular?	I don't think you understand.
Man, what is this?	Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!	Decaffeinated too?
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?	Which country?	Columbia.	Columbia.	Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee.
Wipe 'em out?	Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?	"A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... ""It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail.""  And you are going to do it for me."	Me? How?
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?	That what they call you?
How do you do that?	Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...	Yeah, yeah, I can do it.	When?	"First question got to be ""Where."""	What?	"Not ""What."" Don't need a genius to figure out ""what."" Need a genius to figure out ""where.""  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into."
Hey, boss.	Just the man I wanted to see!	Turn on the T.V.	I did. isn't it neat-o?	Uh...what channel were you watching?	What are you talking about, fella?
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.	Wait a second. Astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? And you know what happens when a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces floating in space.
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'	God, that's what I keep you for.	That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.	Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.	Greed!  Let me tell you something---
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...	KRYPTONITE!	Huh?
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.	They ain't got captains?	Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
And do nothing. Just sit there.	Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?	You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
And then shut down the pipe lines.	Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.	Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. I want you to program one special command into all these systems. Tell them these orders are irreversible, so it'll be impossible for anybody to switch them back. Can you do that, pal?
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!	I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!	The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
Now...when do I get a taste?	I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?	Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
Is this blackmail?	Don't be getting' racist with me, man.	Is this whitemail?	Fair's fair.	What do you want?
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.	For what?	A computer.	We've already got some.	Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.	You designed it?	I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.	What will it do?	Everything.	What will it get me?	Anything.	Tell me more...
Yeah? How's it look?	It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.	I told you it wasn't no jive.	"Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking ""get-down hot-cha daddy-o"" whatever you called it."	Stone mutha.	Exactly. Stoned mother.
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.	Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!	Can you do that?	Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.	Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
You want to mess with Superman?	Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!	Join the party, genius! Come on up!
How you doing down there?	Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.	Hey, you're perfectly safe.	I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?	That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.	Watch out for them air pockets!	No, we're just going down.	We gonna crash?	I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.	We back in Metropolis?	No...I just have a little stop to make.
Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.	Just a second.
Thanks.  Let's go	I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?	Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...	Sister! I'm his sister!
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.	Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.	What she call you?
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.	And do what?
I know, by computers.	Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
Who is she?	Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
Who's the other woman?	That's his sister. Vera Webster.
You're amazing, Olsen. A boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. Then Superman puts out a fire on Third Avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you don't take one picture!!	I didn't have my camera with me.	A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.	What about me?	What about you?	A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
Why do I have to do this?	You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.	It was hot!
Ricky?  Where...what...	I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.	Thank ...you.	Anytime.
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.	We've already met.	And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...	I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.  See you around, pal.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.	Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.	You just did, with that great dinner.
There's no rush.	But the bridge...	Hey, Don't I always get there in time?  Come on, relax.
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:	Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?	The bridge...?  I'd better get going!
The picture looks blurry.	The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
What terrific story?	Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.	Whoopee.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.	Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?	I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
I thought you'd never get here.	Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.	Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.	I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
Lots of things...	Tell me.
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.	Okay, what is it? You want a ride?	Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.	No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?	It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...
I don't know you, lady.	But the other night...	That wasn't me. That guy's gone.  And you're next Webster.
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...	Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!	Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?	Diet soda?	"Energy! And when they say ""Energy"" what do they mean? Nuclear? too dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped."
How would you know?	Hey, I know a lot of things!	So I understand from the graffiti I've seen.
"""At a special session of the General Assembly, 178 countries voted to censure Superman. With only Columbia abstaining."" ROSS That fella's becoming a public menace."	And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
I can't see anything.	Turn on the light.	Where's the light switch?	Where do you usually find a light switch?
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.	Gus?	Superman. The boy you left behind.
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:	In other words, push this red button.
Oh, Superman!	Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!	He can have mine. Anytime.
I can't! It's out of control!	But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.	Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---	Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your integrity is unquestioned. LOIS I have a question.
53.	53!
Okay? Goodbye.	You've got to pick three more numbers.
Mr. White, the next number, please?	How'm I supposed to turn this thing?	By hand. Like the pioneers did.	Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.	Why do I have to do this?
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.	Where's the handle?	There is no handle! You just push a button.
85,000 dollars.	Missing????	Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.
"I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up.""  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!"	My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?	Hello.
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?	He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????	Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
I don't kiss.	Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
"Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather."	But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.	It could make weather!	Storms! Floods!	Blizzards! Heat waves!
Computers talk to other computers, right?	Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
She's not his mama either.	Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.	Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!	Today coffee----	TOMORROW THE OIL!
Small potatoes.	We already have a super-tanker.	Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---	I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.	Don't cry, Bubba.
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!	How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...	What's wrong?	I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.	Where did it come from?	The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
So?	So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...	A normal person.	And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...	We can get to work on that oil!
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...	Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Come on, let's give it a dry run.	Wait for Gus to get here, sis.	Who needs Gus?
He's the only one who can operate this --	Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!	Don't bet on it!
Yes! This time we got it right!	It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
Jimmy, how's the -	Yeah. I'll check.
Anybody been hurt?	So far the hostages are unharmed.	Hostages?	Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
Are you okay?	She'll be fine.
Lois, I usually do.	Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.	Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Lois, what are you doing?	When was the last time you heard me sneeze?	Uh. . .	Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.	One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.	Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
I don't?	Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.	I do?	Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?	Actually, yes.	Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?	Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --	Maybe I could try --	Be my guest.
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?	Really?	Of course, that's what friends are for.
It is kinda romantic.	In July???
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.	Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.	Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.	"But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says."
"A ""complimentary corsage."""	Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.	"Mr. Smith -  -- the ""complimentary couch."""
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...	That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.	Lois, you're amazing.	Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.	No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?	Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.
Where were you?	I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?	I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.	Superman? Oh, was he here?	And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --	Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.	Whoever, I  Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.
Who ????	Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --	No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -	Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?	How could you win a crazy bet like --
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.	What??
Oh Clark, no!	Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
It's true. It's true.	Lois, I . . .	I was right. you are Superman.	Oh come on, that's ridic -
"You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . ."	Maybe you wanted to.	I didn't think I wanted to.	Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?	We'd better talk.	I'm listening.	Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.	"""What's happening."" Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?"	I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
I want to.	Let's go to my place.
Let's go to my place.	Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.	Say you love me.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .	Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .	Let's get you inside . . . .
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.	I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.	I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .	But what can you do? There's no way now . . .	I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .	He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
Hi.	Oh, hi.
Sleep well?	Never closed my eyes.
"I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I ""listened to the voices of  reason"" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?"	I'm sorry.	"Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, ""It's like being married to a doctor,"" I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, "" could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . """	You're not selfish at all.	Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
"""They?"""	"Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say ""Help. Come quick. Now"" I know who you'd have to pick."	What else could I do?	Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?	Lois, someday --	"Please don't tell me ""You'll find somebody else someday."" Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me."	I like worrying about you.
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .	Take it easy. Take a deep breath.	I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?
. . . Superman?. . . . .	Lois, I really don't see why --	Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
I'll try to remember that . . .	Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.	You do?	Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
Everything on it?	Everything on it.
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?	Uh...home...	Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?	Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --	Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
But . . ..that's terrible!	That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --	Does Lois know about this yet?	Does she know about it? She's in it!	What??	The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
Gee. But --	No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.	No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?	What else is ballast for?	How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.	There is some good in you, Lex, after all.	You'll have to pack quickly.	A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?	A parka.	You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.	North!
Mush!  Mush!	Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.	A good time! Is that all you care about?!	I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
I like trees.	So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
You'll miss the battle of the century!	Good. My heart can't take it.	Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.	Why am I doing this? Why am I here?	Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
This way Lex.	It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.	Genius!  --  Lex.	I'll be alright.	No, me, me, me. Thank you.	It's beautiful.	It's beautiful.
It has everything.	Wrong.	Why didn't you go before we left?	That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .	It's beautiful.
Artemis? Do you read me?	What'd he say before? He saw a girl?	"I think he said a ""curl."""	What's a curl?	Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?	How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.	"Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group."
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris	He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?	Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.	Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!	Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.	Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --	Yes, but it's not all I feel.	Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --	Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.	But you had more than that, and I know it. You and my father --  you had each other.  Can I never have what you had?
And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?	Yes.
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.	Now This I want to hear.	"For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as ""criminals."""	My kind of people.	The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -	Sensible enough.	And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.	No possibility for parole?	The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.	I asked the right question.	The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -	I didn't ask her anything . . .
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...	I want my Liberace record back tonight.	DELETE IN CUTTING
DELETE IN CUTTING	I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.	Where?	North.	Why?	To ski?	"OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready."	Oh! That black box in our cell?	Shhhhhhh!	That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?	That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.	Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.	
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...	We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.	Oh magnificent one. What I am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son  of Jor-El.
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.	The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
Oh my Fullness, as I explained to you before, I am about the best there is. Second best there is.	Revenge! We will kill the son of our jailer!
He flies as well, then . . .	Constantly.	He has powers as we do . . .	Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.	We will bring him to his knees!
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .	What do you want?	Australia.
Superman! The --	Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --	The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
You must be freezing.	I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.	Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
So --  I hope you like it.	Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.	Dinner. Oh yes.  I'm sorry, I just never do much about that.  But tonight -- I mean, anything you want, Lois.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.	Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.	Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.	But him is you.  Now I'm confused.
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.	Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.	I'll have to take the chance. Try to get them all into that molecule chamber. It takes away their powers, reduces them to human beings. Now if you could . . .
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!	Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .	Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .	Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .	Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.	Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
"You said it. Three-to-one should get you 								both ears and the tail."	He ran in fear from us . . .
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?	Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
"There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face."	"Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . ."	What more?	Cuba.
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.	Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?	North. Keep going North!
Put down Lex Luthor !	Put down Lex Luthor?
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --	Now I shall have the Son of Jor-El as my slave! Forever. If not, the millions of earthlings you protect will pay for your defiance.  Beginning with this one.
"I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives."	It will. Starting with your own.
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?	I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.	Zod.  Zod.
Who is this . . . Superman?	You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .	Come to me, Superman! If you dare! I defy you! Come! Come, and kneel before Zod!
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?	In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.	There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?	Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.	Yes, but will you honor it?	We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
Free!	Free!
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..	Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!	"DELETE IN CUTTING 		) There . . .  A place called . . . Houston . . ."
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.	DELETE IN CUTTING	And I will lead.
So this is the planet Houston . . .	What shall we do now?	Stay. I will come to you.
Look, they need a machine to fly.	Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
You are master of all you survey.	And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
"This ""super"" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness."	Yes?	He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .	Sentimental idiot.
He's captured Non!	Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
General --- ?	We must combine our strength.
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?	"""Super-sucker . "" For once, Lex Luthor was right."
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'	I really don't think . . .	But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...	And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.	That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion ... although ...
They make my eyes itch.	Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
You're late. Very late.	Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.	Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
I've never been in a place like this before.	This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.	Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?	No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.	That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.	What about here?	Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.	Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.	That sounds kind of pessimistic.	No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
I feel kind of light-headed . . .	Don't worry, I've got you.
Maybe I should sit this one out.	Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.	If you say so. Here goes.
He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.	I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .	Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.	I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
Gee, I don't think . . .	Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.	. . . Let me get my purse.
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?	Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!	But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
Oh . . . my . . .	Clark. . . !
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.	Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
Gee, I'm really sorry.	No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.	I'm sorry to see you go.	You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.	I'm not so sure you do.	Any more like you back home, Clark?	Like me?	You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.	Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.	Lacy. . . I . . .
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.	That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?	Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
No Paris?	I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.	Clark . . . wait!
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.	You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.	I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'	It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.	Politely?
. . . Please leave your message at the beep.	Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .	You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
Superman? Has something happened to him?	Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.	You know him so well.  But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.	Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.	Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.	But Superman isn't an average man.	And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!	And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?	Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
And what do we get out of it?	If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.	Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
Impossible? Why?	Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.	But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?	I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
Well, I don't understand.	I'm sorry.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?	Absolutely!
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?	N-no...I mean...you bet.
Awesome!	Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.	I'll try. . .
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .	Go on . . .	But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.	Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.	Mr. White, come with me I want to see
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!	Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!	Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .	Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.	I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.	Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .	Daddy . . . ?	Yes, darling?	Stuff it.
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!	I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.	Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.	Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
Is he for real?	One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
I think he's kind of cute.	Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.	. . . And  very naïve!
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.	Superman gets mail here?
I think there's an angle.	An angle?	Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.	Who?	Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.	That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.	Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.	Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .	But he's never there.	Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
What's he going to say?	Something . . . wonderful.
What's that?	Our other dinner guest.
Where's Clark?	He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.	It always is with Clark.
Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?	Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!	A toupee that flies?	. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.	But why the hair?	That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.	Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
Whoa. . .	He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . .
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.	Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.	I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.	Get the box, nephew.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?	Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . .	The one Superman wrecked up?	Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?	You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.	There!
Hey! He looks . . . normal.	He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
Hey! Just remember I made you.	You're just an experiment, freako!
What was that about?	Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.	Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy.
He's . . . cold. . .	Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.	What?
Boy, are you gonna get it.	My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
We'll all fry.	This wasn't in the plan.	I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.	Ready, Uncle Lex?	If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
You think he'll find us.	Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.	Lucky I brought my drums.
What I need this for?	For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...	You are . . .	What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?	You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
I am an experiment? I am freako?	I made you, and I can destroy you.
Destroy Superman!	Wait! Not yet! Back!
Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.	First, I have fun.
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?	What do you fear?	Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?	Destiny.
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!	I am master now.
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.	Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.	Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great!
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?	Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .	It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?	Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?	You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.	No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
I'm not going anywhere.	I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.	Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.	Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.	You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.	Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.	A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!	Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
I'll deal with you later.	Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
But . . . how could you beat him?	High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?	No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
I know, but  --	Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!	Bunkers!	I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.	Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?	Nobody else.	Shut up, apple-polisher.
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?	He's thirty-five years old.	You're a great architect, Albert.	Thank you.	Otherwise, you're a Mongoloid idiot.  It's reasonable to assume that fragments of the planet were shot out into space by the force of the explosion, and  --
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!	We're running out of smoke.
But Mr. Luthor, sir, I already  --	And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --	Albert!	--  thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of  --
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.	One of them should've been you.	Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!	Got it? Otis?
Me?	Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.	I've been on the job.	A hot story, huh?	It was hot, yes.	You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.	Lois isn't here?	She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.	What's she doing in California?	It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic.
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?	No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.	I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
Don't worry, Mom. I know.	Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
Mom...	I know.
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.	He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
Mother...	I know son, I know...
Do you know where you're headed?	North. It's north
Keep warm now.	I will.
I'd like to.	Well!
I'll bet you have some good ideas.	Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Your bookie?	No.	I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.	Actually, she's silver-haired.	Not...gray.	Not really, no.
Are there any more at home like you?	Not really, no.
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?	I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.	Some people aren't the athletic type.	But otherwise it's swell.	'Swell.' When  was the last time I heard anybody say  -  where are you from , anyway?
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?	Unbelievable.	Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack, the stab in the back, the --
Hey!	What the  --  !
Stop him, Clark!	He may have a gun!	Oh, for God's sake!
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.	You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.	Supposing that man had hurt you? Is it worth risking your life over ten dollars, two credit cards, and a lipstick? I mean, it's not as if --
Know what?	You described the exact contents of my purse.	I just took a shot at it.
What now, my love?	Huh?	Big night coming up?	Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?	Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.	Oh.	It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.	Don't you ever give up?
For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.	No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.	There's no real proof that tobacco  --	Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
Can I take you to the airport?	Not unless you can fly.	Come again?
I'm telling you, I was there.	You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.	It wasn't a trick!	Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.	Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -	It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.	There weren't any wires. I looked.	Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.	He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?	Look, there was probably a trampoline on the roof somewhere and this joker just took a big bounce.	Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.	I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.	You're just jealous.	Jealous? Of what?	Of this...Superman.
What'd you call him?	Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?	Is that what they're calling him?	They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.	Super...man. Hmmm...	It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?	No thanks.
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.	You're not the only one.	Yes, but I'm the only one who knows him. I  --  I really like the guy. And he likes me.  I think. I mean, I could talk to him, you know? And he could talk to me.  Anytime...
Listen...thank you.	You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
You! The girl from the volcano!  Kryptonite...	Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.	What are you doing here?	Screaming	Besides that.	He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.	The bald man! The one who tried to kill me?	The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.	I'd better get you down.
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?	Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.	Oh.	Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.	What can I tell you? He's my leader.	Okay.  Take me to your leader.
You and your real estate.	Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?	It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.	So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'	"My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."""	Your father was a sick weirdo.	I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.	This??	Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.	So I've noticed.	Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.	Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.	You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?	Even that would be an improvement.
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?	What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
Again???	First the pets, Otis.
I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!	You think he's for real?	He's from another world.
Nuts. He made it.	Tough guy, huh?
Bet he makes it.	You're on.
Shut up.	I didn't say a word.
Damn!  This will get him.	Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
What's the temperature now?	Fifty degrees below and still falling.	When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
Krypton!	Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.	I read the article.	Exactly, Miss Teschmacher.
See?	See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?	I'm going to bed.	Stay and listen!  Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed.
Mr. Romance...	Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
Meteorites!	Bingo!
"Ahh. 'National Geographic."" In my day, this made 'Playboy"" look like Mother Goose."	I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --	Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.	I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?	No, you're going to get kissed,
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.	I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
You're happy, aren't you?	La de da da...	You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...	We just take it?	What do you suggest, my dear?	The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?	I don't like to talk about it, Lex.	Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?	You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.	Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.
Ready?	Ready.
They stop for nothing.	But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --	Nothing.
Don't let me down.	You?! How about me?	You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.
No news is not good news. Y'know	There was a recipe on the back  --	Something you can feed the pets, perhaps?  Let's have it.
You're not going to hit me?	Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.	I knew you'd hit me.
You've been under such a strain. And I've ...I've --  -- neglected you. Mea culpa! Y'know.	I know...
She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.	A night on the town instead of under it?	Baby -- I'm going to take you higher.
I don't understand.	Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!	This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?	Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.	I didn't bring any  --
Oh. Why? does he live up here?	Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.	What are you going to do to him?
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.	Tea?	You got wax in your ears?	What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?	He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?	Lex is going bye-bye.
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?	Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.	Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?	I'm wearing it.	I mean the other one!	What other one?	You can't do this to me!	Of course I can. I love you.
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.	Jor-El, Be warned. This tone of yours approaches insolence.	"My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!"	You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -	Then -	But so is Vond-El
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.	This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!	And if I don't obey?
As an irredeemable criminal? You compare me to them?	If you persist, you leave us no choice.
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?	Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
What're you writing, Lois?	"an Ode to Spring. are there one or two ""T's"" in bloodletting?"	Two.	'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.'
Boy!	Gets you where you live, huh?	How come you get all the good stories, Lois?	It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.	On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
It's a ...baby.	What's your name, boy?	Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.	All of us.
The good lord works in mysterious ways.	He sure as heck does that.	All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.	Folks'll ask question.	We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.	Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?	I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton	Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.	We don't want a child called 'Junior,' ain't that so, Clark? Why sure it is.
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -	Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --	What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.	I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...	-- as we will be.	Lara, please...	But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.	They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.	A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.	Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.	He'll be weightless.	Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.	He will be odd, different.	"Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit."
You've been doing some research in the archives.	I want to know what my child is going to face.	Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -	Enjoyed it?	I guess I got carried away	My son, I foresaw this. I knew -	No! You couldn't imagine -	How good it felt!	How good it felt -
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -	Twenty-four.	Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.	There are none of them any good anyway.	And it is forbidden for you to interfere with human history. All you can do, Kal-El, even now that you have...found yourself...is help them to evolve. Set an example. Show them they must strive towards the light. And... remember us...
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.	It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around	Okay, but...why?  No offense.
Lois, the kickback story...	Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.	I was going to say that there's only one 'p' in subpoena. What the hell did you major in at Radcliffe? Middle English?  Nice job on the teamster's update, Kent.
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?	He is. Usually.	Whoever comes up with that will make Woodward and Bernstein look like Abbot and Costello.
Easy now, miss, I've got you???	You've got me? Who's got you???	Do as I say. Let go!	Oh, God! I'm going to die!	Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
Who...who...	Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
With my luck, now it'll rain.	Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Superman???	Right on the first guess.	Wha'...what are you doing here?	I came to talk to you.	The answer is yes. Now what's the question?	There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.	This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?	Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
Well...flashlight?	I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.	If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.	Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?	Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.	I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.	Oh.  Well, where do we start?	Ask, You're the girl reporter.	Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.	You think they're strange?	I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.	I guess they are a little odd.	Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.	I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.	Oh.	The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.	It must feel great.	It's not bad.	How old are you?	Thirty-five.	How much do you weigh?	195 pounds.	What about this X-Ray vision of yours?	What about it?	Can you really see through anything?	Uh-huh.	Is it true you're impervious to pain?	Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.	Do bullets really bounce off you?	Only when somebody shoots them at me.
What color underwear am I wearing?	Pink.
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?	Sure.	Do you like pink?	Very much.	Where do you hail from?	Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
I...uh...	No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?	Yessir. Just what you wanted.
There.	Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!	Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?	Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
What's the matter, Otis?	Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.	Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I broke the man out of prison --	I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.	I gave him steady employment --	I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.	I gave him this new face.	I...uh...check.
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?	I guess I...uh...regressed.
Please...	Otis...
Is that real enough for you?	It is for me.	Y'know? I'm sure of it. Y'know? And there's a strong streak of goody- goody in him that is going to blow this deal for me if I don't do something about it.  Something!
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!	You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --	Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher, pack your --
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.	It's a Twinkie, boss.
They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.	Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.	Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.	Oh, Mr. Luthor...
I still don't get it.	Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
Sort of.	Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it...
What is this??!	Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?	But...why?
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?	Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?	Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
This is California. The richest, most populous state in America. And growing like a sonofagun.	I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.	No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --	Of time, Luthor.	Right, right. Where was I? Ah, yes --
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.	Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.	Couldn't have said it better myself.  Now all this  --  --  west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here  --  --  is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well...  ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point --  --  that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.'  Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know...
Nice! Most of California would have been destroyed. Millions of people would've been killed! The West Coast as we know it would have  --	--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.	Maybe I should get help.	It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --	You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.	The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.	I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...	On radio waves?	And garbage doors.
Luthor  --	You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...	They'll soon be over.	In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.	For the first time today, Superman I must tell you that you're wrong.  But how could you know that -  Oh, well. I guess I could tell you now. Y'see, actually...but this conversation is becoming rather dry, isn't it.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!	We'll see how fast I can fly.
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.	Alison Jones.
Yes.	Ally.  That was my nickname.	Ally.  That's right.	How are you?	I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?	I'm fine.  Still working with my father.	And what does he do again?	He used to work with you.  Until you found out he was having an affair with your wife.
Ally Jones.	How is Mrs. Stephens?	We're...not together.	I'd heard that.  But she's well?	Yes...fine.	And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.	Are you still in touch?	Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.	Which one?	Which one?	Which clinic?	I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.	Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
So there were others?	Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...	Then...when did she get better?	She didn't.	But you said...	That's where I'm going.  To see her.	She's in trouble?	Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
What...does it turn to?	It turns to steaming piss.
I'm...so sorry.	That's okay.
I...don't think so.	I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.	What happened?	I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
What happened?	Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.	Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.	Alison.	Alison.	Say hi to Zoe.	I will.	I hope she gets better.	I'll tell her that.
My name is...	Mister, I don't want to know your name.	I understand.	No you don't.
I can help you.	Not unless you can raise the dead.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.	No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.	Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.	You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.	Case?	The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.	I know Risa and Wendell Walker. They wouldn't hire a goddamned lawyer.  And the Ottos wouldn't deal
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.	Why are you telling me this?	I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.	Why are you telling me this?	I'm telling you this because we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel...
Hi, Nicole.	Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...	They just finished supper.	Was it good?
I'll be back around nine.	Okay.
Are you sure?	Yeah.	It just seems...kind of weird.	Why?	I don't know.	Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.	No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.	And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?	I'm not sure.	Oh.  Right.
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.	Goodnight, Nicole.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.	Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.	Billy, please.  The children.	The children.
How is Nicole?  Is she around?	She's resting.  In her room.	Say hello for me.
So what brings you out tonight?	Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.	It does concern me.	Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.	How?
Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.	Why not?	Because it's what we have to do.	Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.	Okay, fine.  So...stay out of it.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.	So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.	But yours is the one who's going to subpoena me, Sam.  Force me to testify in court.  He came by the garage this afternoon.  Gave me this piece of paper.
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.	That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.	That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...	C'mon, you know that won't...	We've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards.  We've got people pointing fingers, making side deals, and dickering over percentages. Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad.  The rescue squad.  Because they didn't act fast enough.
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.	Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.	It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.	I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.	I'm sorry.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.	Billy, that's too early.	She said she's got to be home by nine.	Can't you make it later?
Have you been waiting long?	A while.	Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?	No.  It should be dry by now.
What time's he coming home?	When the game's over, I guess.
What are you thinking?	Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.	That's because he misses you.
Yes.	It's natural.	Your kids never cry.	Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.	They can look forward to that.	Sure.	Just like we look forward to this.
You're leaving.	I better get back.
Good night, Billy.	Good night.
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?	Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...	Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.	...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.	You believe that?	I have to.	Why?	Because I have to.	Well I don't.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?	Yes.	Why did you do that, Billy?	You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.	What do you mean by that, Dolores?	About the Ottos?	Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...	Do they have any reputation for drugs?	No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.	And they loved Bear.	Oh yes.  Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school.  It's like he was their little treasure.  He was such a beautiful boy.  That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott.
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.	For rabbits?	
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.	From what?	From what?	Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...	No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.	You talked about it?	No.  I saw it on his face.
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.	Berries.	Yes.  Like I was putting them into my big basket.  Clearing the hillside of its children.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.	Berry-picking.	Yes.  The old-fashioned way.	And what's that?	With our hands.
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.	Were his parents...attentive to him?	What do you mean?	You mentioned that he had a learning disability.	That's right.	Did his parents attend to that?	What do you mean?	Did they give him special care?	The Walkers loved Sean.  He was their only child...the object of all their attention.  I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his nature.  But Risa, she's still got dreams.
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.	What's that, Dolores?
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?	That would complicate things.	Because I'd be to blame, right?	Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.	He knows that?  Billy?	Yes.  He does.	Billy said that?
You've talked to Billy?	I did.	And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...	Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.	What other people?	Excuse me?	Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
You heard what Abbott said?	Yes.	Anything you didn't understand?	There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
That's what he said, is it?	Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.	Why would he be frightened?	I don't know.  But it was weird in terms of what happened next.  Sean was still watching his mother.
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.	Hi, Dolores.
What do you think?	Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.	You hate it.	I didn't say that.	I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.	I'll just strap it on the roof.
It's for the school bazaar.	Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.	Away from your crazy Mom.	The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
You want a cup of tea or something?	A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...	How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.	No.  A little sugar though.	We've only got honey.	I'll...take it straight.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.	Isn't it a lovely day?	What happened to summer?	Summer's over.  It's fall.	And winter?	Well, winter's far behind us now.
How was it?	We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
So do you like your new room?	It's interesting.	Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.	I feel like a princess.
Is this mine?	Yes.  It's a present.	From you?	No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.	Who's Mr. Stephens?
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?	No.  What's this lawyer business?
Nicole!	It's the truth.
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.	Did he say what about?	No.	Was he drinking?  Could you tell?	Jenny, it's time for you to go to bed.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?	That's what he said.
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.	Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...	What's a ditty again?	It's like a song.	Oh.
What's vermin again?	Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...	Nicole?	Yes.	Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?	Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?	I want to sit beside you tomorrow.	Okay.
Nicole?	What, Mason?
That's right.	Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?	Because...he wanted to them to be punished.	The people in the town?	Yes.	So he was mean?	No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.	Oh.	Should I keep reading?	Okay.
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...	You hate that.
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.	That you didn't die?  Like the other children?	Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.	What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.	I won't lie.	I don't want you to lie.	The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.	There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.	You seem very sure about that.	I'm absolutely positive.
Dolores.	Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.	Why?	So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
It was snowing.	Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.	Was the bus on time?
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?	I object to that form of question. Note that.
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'	Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.	And what was the weather like at this time?
I have no questions.	Thank you, Nicole.
Do you have a room?	Will you be spending more than a night?	Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.
What about Doreen?	She...she was a friend of mine.	When?	At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...	That's the local bar?	...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
What do you mean?	People who will help our cause.
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.	There's the Prescots...
Tell me about the Ottos.	Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.	Indian?
Yes.	That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.	What do they do?	Crafts.	Crafts?	Wanda does these photographic things.  That's one of her pictures on the wall.
Have they ever been busted?	No.
Need a hand?	Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
You always think you're prepared for these things.	Tell me about it.	How old is she?	Almost three.	Is this it?	Perfect.	Here we go.	Thanks.
I'm in a car wash.	A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.	Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?	Why are you calling me, Zoe?	Why am I calling you?  You're my father.  I'm not supposed to call you?  What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.	So what's the problem?	The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.	'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
DADDY!!!	Yes.
Why can't you talk to me?	I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
Yes, I'll accept the charges.	Daddy?	Yes.	I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.	News?	Don't you want to hear?	Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.	You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.	Tell me your news, Zoe.	Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.	That's not news, Zoe.	No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?	Yes.	I tested positive.	Yes.	Welcome to hard times, Daddy.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.	I need money.	What for?	You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.	Do you have the blood test?	You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?	Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.	Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
Oh God, I'm scared.	I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
Some more wine?	I'm afraid this meat is overdone.	I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?	What is it?	Poached salmon.
We do.	Is there shrimp on it?	Yes.	If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...	I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.	Well, let's see what we get.
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.	Who are you?	I'm a lawyer.	You can't come here.	Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.	No.	Please.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.	You've been retained?	Yes.	Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.	Who did they get for that?	You are angry, aren't you, Mrs. Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give your anger a voice.  To be your
Dolores?	It's my belief that Dolores was doing exactly what she'd been doing for years.  Besides, the school board's insurance on Dolores is minimal.  A few million at the very most.  The really deep pockets are to be found in the town, or in the company that made the bus.	You think someone else caused the accident?	Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
So you're just the thing we need.	Excuse me?	Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?	Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
Are you expensive?	No.	If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.	Do you have this agreement with you?
Are you a reporter?	No.
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.	In what way?
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.	Any criminal record?	Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.	Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.	How does the family survive?	Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?	Yes.	What time in the morning was this?	About eight-thirty in the morning.	Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.	Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?	Like what?  I mean, I don't remember a lot.
Yes.	And where did you sit that morning?	My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.	And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?	Until the accident?  No.  Yes, there was.
No.	Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?	Yes.	You remember that much?	As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
Yes.	There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.	You are?	Yes.
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?	Before the actual accident?	Yes.
I was scared.	Why were you scared?	This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?	Yes, I understand.	Why were you scared?	Dolores was driving too fast.
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?	The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.	You could see the speedometer?	Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?	Seventy-two miles an hour.	Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?	Positive.
You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?	I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
You saw the speedometer?	Yes.	Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?	No.	Why not?	I was scared.  And there wasn't time.	There wasn't time?	No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.	You remember this?	Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
What do you remember about the accident?	I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
That was great.	Really?	You're going to blow everyone away.	You mean it?	Of course.	You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.	I am.  Really.  It was awesome.
What's so funny?	Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
What took so long?	Nothing.
What's that?	Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.	Does it fit?
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.	Don't even try to remember.
How do you like it, Nicole?	The ramp?	Pretty slick, eh?	Very slick.	Do you like the colour?	It's okay.	And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
The door needs a lock.	Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.	Oh.  I better get some spackle.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.	You and Mom have a lawyer?	Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.	My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
It's because of the accident, Nicole.  Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers.  A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.	But you didn't lose me.
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.	What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?	Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.	How will he do that?	Well, Mr. Stephens is representing several families.  The Ottos, the Walkers, us, and I think a couple more.  Mr. Stephens is suing the town for negligence.  He's sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right. He's a very smart man.
What are you up to, Nicole?	Nothing.	Nothing good on your T.V.?	As opposed to this T.V.?
Are you sleeping?	No.	Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.	Great.	You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to.
What do you mean?	I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.	Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?	Great.
Yes.	How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.	Okay.
What's going to happen to Dolores?	I don't know.	Will the police do anything to her?	It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.	She'll move away.	There's talk of that.	Someplace where no one knows her.  Someplace strange and new.
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.	Yeah, right.
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.	But Charlene...	Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.	The Ottos.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.	You don't know that.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...	How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.	It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?	That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!	Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Will you mind your own business!	Hitler!
Where are we running?  What am I missing here?	Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!	That's the horse!  Shotgun - Shotgun in the fifth!
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?	"Is ""he"" inside?"	But of course...	Alone or surrounded?	A Senator, an Agent and Something - With - Long - Red - Hair.
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?	Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?	Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
He's somewhere...	Thanks, I see him...
Come on boys, break it up...	The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
Did she accept?	You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.	I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -	Don't apologize for me, Frank!	...excited with good reason, I wanted to say.  Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker, please.	We're on our way there now...
I still think he's responsible for the smear.	Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!	I guess you're right, but -
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.	I doubt that it matters any more.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.	Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.	And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...	See my mother?	I only had a few hours.
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.	Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.	Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?	You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?	Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.	You told him that?	Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?	Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.	That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?	Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.	Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.	I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
...People catch on quick to such an item.  Van Cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet.	Then what are you doing here?  Go over there and fight!  If Van Cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth!
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!	I'm late for a date with a dame.
How is dear old J.J. by the way?	Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.	If it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours...
"You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. ""Leo"", I says, ""Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."""	And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?	I see you're full of human feelings...
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis.	Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  Right, Otis?	Right!
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...	Give me a chance --
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!	Hurry back.
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...	You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.	Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...	I'll by that, son.  Now, you owe ME a favor.  Be good to my kid sister...
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?	No, I wouldn't...	Serious as a deacon...I like it.  I like your style, son!  In a world of old rags and bones, I like it! For instance, take Sidney.
Does he have to be here in our hair?	Why, has he bothered you before?	Is it news to you?	Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.	Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --	Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!	Well, just be careful you don't knock her down, huh?
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...	No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.	Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?	He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?	Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---	Wait a minute, I haven't handed over punishing privileges to you YET!  Put the whip down and I might respect what you're saying...
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.	You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...	I'm afraid I can't cope with them.
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.	"Those ""dears"" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?"	May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?	I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!	Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt!
If looks could kill, I'm dead...	No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...	And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.	Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!	Son, I don't fancy shooting mosquitoes with elephant guns.  So suppose you just shuffle along and call it a day...
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--	Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.	Why?	What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...	Did Sidney tell you about it?	Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this boy too well.  Anything in these charges?
Not being partial, are you?	No, I'm not.  I'm not!
Why are you trembling, dear...?	History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...	But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?	I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...	Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER  I'm not fighting with you, puss...
Sidney is a liar!	Who said Sidney?	I said Sidney!...
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.	I thought we were talking about Sidney?	Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...	I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!	I'm taking up the situation with you now...	Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world.
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...	A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?	J.J., Steve isn't...
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?	No...	Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here!  Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart...
Susie, I'm sorry if---	Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?	No.  I'm going home.
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!	Susan!...
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.	Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.	Now don't kid a kidder.
Now, come, J.J., that's a little too harsh.  Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.	This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public.  Because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.
There is some allusion here that escapes me...	We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?	Why does everything you say sound like a threat?
Hello, Harry.	Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
"I just checked ""downtown"".  Quiet everywhere tonight."	Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?	Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.	She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.	I don't believe it.
Say, that's good - it's nice - in fact, it's APT, Harry!	Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.	"I remember ONCE when you didn't quite ""put things together"".  Boy! Was the Mayor mad!"
Can I come out?  No.	I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.	You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.	Can I come in for a minute?	No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...	I have a message from your sister.
I know Manny Davis.	Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
Match me, Sidney...	Not just this minute, J.J....
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.	You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?	You print them, don't you?	Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!	I didn't say that, J.J.	The day that I can't get along without press agents' handouts, I'll close up shop, lock, stock and barrel and move to Alaska.
"Spahish...that must show he likes ""spigs"", too."	I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
You told me you'd break up that romance - when?	You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.	I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.	Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
Frankly, J.J., I don't think you got the cards to blitz me.	I don't?	Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...	I'll listen one more minute.
"Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. ""Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here."" Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column..."	Are you finished?	No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!	"Not ""we"", Sidney, you!"	Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.	Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound.  I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!	What you promised - do it!  Don't finagle around.  It's later than you think.
Uh huh.	When?	Tonight.  Before you go to bed. The cat is in the bag and the bag is in the river.
J.J., I want you to get them back their job, Steve and the Quintet.	You mean they've been fired already, on the basis of this crude smear?
I know Steve.  No.	Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!	J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!	How?	Get Steve back his job...please...	He means that much to you...?	"Yes.  With your ""prestige"" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel."	You're picking up my lingo, hon.	I read your column every day...
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?	No, I won't...
I'm not sure I can reach him in time.	Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to...  By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?	With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.	I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.	Can't hurt...	Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.	I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.	But it's too late.  I got him back the job...	No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!	Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!	And who's feet is she on now?	Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.	What's this boy got that Susie likes?	Integrity - acute, like indigestion.	What does that mean - integrity?	"A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's ""integrity""."
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...	Calculated risk.  Only we happen to know, J.J., that you like me.  I'm your star pupil -- I reflect back to you your own talent.
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!	Don't go wild, Sidney.	Wild?  Take a look at them and see who's wild...
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!	But not for anything I did today...	Sidney, I know human nature.  Susie lied to me - she'll see that boy again.
Are you listening?	How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -
Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...	She knows now.	Why give her real proof?  You nearly ruined her with her first husband - and you were right, J.J., - but she almost followed him out the window.  What do you want - a chronic invalid?
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.	The man in jail is always for freedom.
Sidney, I told you -	J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -	Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
Talk to her, Sidney...	Talk to her yourself...
Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!	You're incapable of the truth...	Susie, there's nothing wrong with Dallas!  Your brother and I arranged it all. And if the Leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life, forget it! - your brother arranged that one, too!  I don't usually give away presents; but this is my gift to you: Get out of here!  Leave this man!
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.	I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.	"He's leaving early.  After this ""set"".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes..."
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...	- He's got them on him.	...And he's got them on him.  I appreciate a thing like that - I appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city.
Is that a fact?  He's a dilly, ain't he?  By the by, what did he have against this boy?	He goes out with girls.	Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?	Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
I thought he would.	Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.	What about?	Something about a Frank D'Angelo trying to reach you...
Could this be that boy?	Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
Bribing me again?	And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
"Who put this item in about the comic?  ""If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming."" Does this Temple have a press agent?"	No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
What's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?	Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.	I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?	I don't think so.	You're sure.  Find out for me.	Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
Is Frank D'Angelo around?	At the bar - Sidney...
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?	No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
Avidly.  He was staring.	Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.	He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?	...cigarette girls... And naturally -	"You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you ""interviewed""?"	In his apartment -	And where was his wife?	I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.	We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?	But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?	That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
Do you still keep your key under the mat?	Can you be there by two-thirty?
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.	Hello.
Back?	One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
Don't you know who that man is?	Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.	Yeah!	And he's a perfect stranger to me.	So take five minutes!  Get acquainted!  He's an important man - he's lonely - don't be dumb!
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?	What kind of an act is this?
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?	I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...	What sort of thing?	This sort of thing!	Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
A girl needs a little romancing before she -	Next time I'll call in a guy to paint silver stars on the ceiling!	What would you think of me if -	Nothing I didn't think of you before.	- that's what I mean!
That's the third time he's called today.	He wants me to break a leg?	No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...	It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.	But...	But what?	That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.	May I rent you out as an adding machine.
Who else phoned?	The renting agent and the tailor.	Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.	It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.	Help me with two minutes of silence!
Go home, Sally.  It's late...	I hate to see you like this --
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --	Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...	You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???	Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?	Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
You ought to be used to me by now.	I'm used to you...	No.  You think I'm a hero.  I'm no hero.  I'm nice to people where it pays me to be.  I gotta do it too much on the outside, so don't expect me to kow-tow in my own office.  I'm in a bind right now with Hunsecker so --  Every dog has his day!  Lock up and leave the key.
If that's for me, tear it up!	Take a top coat.	And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?
What's the matter?	Nothing...
Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?	Yes.
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...	I know you do, Sidney.	Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved...
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...	That's no way to talk...	Or what you see in me, for that matter...	Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.	If you want me to -
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -	Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop.  For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?	Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?	Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
Why me...?	Why not you?	"That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, ""Why not you?"""	Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.	Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?	It is a favor, isn't it?	According to you, yeah.  Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty!  I don't like you, comma, but neither do I go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds.  Also, since we're talking repulsive, J.J. won't like this for two cents!  Don't give me that look, Dallas - J.J. believes in fair play.  And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend!
You're talking very fast.	Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!	Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!	Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!	Temple, I caught your act the other night and -	Did you now?  On which bounce?	- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.	Cheers.  What time is it, Al?
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.	Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
If there's a funnier man in the world than Herbie Temple at the Palace...uh...pardon us for not catching the name, we were too busy laughing.  No, make that 'screaming'.  It's sweet of you, J.J., thanks. Probably see you at Twenty One tonight.  No, for supper, late. Right. 'Bye...	Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.	See me in my office.
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?	You tell him, I stutter!
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...	I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present.  Wanna bite to eat?
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?	Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.	We stick in each others craw.	Yes, but why?	Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?	Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?	Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.	Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.	Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...	But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.	I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -	Come on now, chickie, why don't you go to bed...?
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.	What ship?
Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!	Like you?	Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!	I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -	I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?	I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...	I didn't do anything!	...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months -	Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
J.J., if you think -	Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I am just going -	Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.
I tried to reach you twice -	What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?	Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -	Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -	That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
No more you don't!  What is this - You're showing off for her?  They're supposed to hear you in Korea?	He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!	If you're funny, James, I'm a pretzel!  Drop dead!
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -	Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
You haven't told him yet...	I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -	But he isn't going to like this, Susie.  And he makes you nervous, not me.  No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too.  But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.	Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -	But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?	Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
I have a message for you; I love you.  May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -	If the stores are open -	And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -	And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?	I made you write a beautiful song...	No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around...	Steve, stop it please...
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.	Why did you call me?	Would you buy me a cup of coffee? In there...
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?	Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...	No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.	But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.	I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.	Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
Steve, I...	But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!	But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...	I told your brother I couldn't be his accomplice.  I can't be yours either, Susie, and encourage him to go on pulverizing you.  I know what type - he's my old man all over again!
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?	Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?	You are saying goodbye, aren't you...?
You going to work all day?	I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...	You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.	I can't	Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.	Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --	I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.	I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close.
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.	Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?	That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
Please... let... the kids... go...	Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
Do you know about the chip?	What chip?	They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.	Those lying motherfuckers!	I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
We should abort.	NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
Do you have bandages?	In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
My God.	Now listen to me very carefully.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?	No one must follow your work.	Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care.
No good.	Let me try mine.
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?	Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.	No way!
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?	I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.	This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?	My mission is to protect you.	Yeah?  Who sent you?	You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?	Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.	What does that mean?	Liquid metal.	Radical.	You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
Where we going?	We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.	Can I stop by my house?	Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.	You sure?	I would.
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?	Max.
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?	Anything it samples by physical contact.
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?	No.  Only an object of equal size.
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?	It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  But everything she said was true.  We gotta get her out of there.	Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.	Oh, great.  And what happens to her?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.	TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!	Negative.  She is not a mission priority.	Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
Oww!  Why'd you do that?	You told me to.
You have to do what I say?!	That is one of my mission parameters.	Prove it... stand on one foot.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!	Of course.  I'm a terminator.
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!	Why?	Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!	Why?	You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?	Right.
Swear.	What?	"Just say ""I swear I won't kill anyone."""
Everything.	Cool.
Does it hurt?	I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
How long do you live?  I mean, last?	A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
Affirmative.	"No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like ""Affirmative"" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo."
"It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say ""eat me""... if you wanna shine them on, it's ""Hasta la vista, baby""."	"""Hasta la vista, baby""?"	"Yeah, or ""later, dickwad.""  Or if someone gets upset you say ""chill out.""  Like that.  Or you can do combinations."	Chill out, dickwad.	That's great!  See, you're getting it.	No problemo.
And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while.	Smile?	Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile, right? Watch.
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.	It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Excellent.	Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
Not even of dying?	No.	You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?	No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
Torque wrench please.	Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.	You will.	Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
Why do you cry?	You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.	Pain causes it?	Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?	No.
Alriight!!  My man!	No problemo.
"""No fate.""  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes ""The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."""	She intends to change the future somehow.	I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!	Dyson.	Yeah, gotta be!  Miles Dyson!  She's gonna blow him away!
This is tactically dangerous.	Drive faster.	The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.	I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.	Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.	I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
I'll deal with the police.	Remember what I said, you can't...	Trust me.
Drive for a minute.	Where you going?!
We don't have much time.	What?
Is it dead?	Terminated.
Will it melt in there?	Yes.  Throw it in.
No!	I'm sorry, John.	No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!	I have to go away, John.	Don't do it.  Please... don't go --
It must end here... or I am the future.	I order you not to!
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?	Gimme that Phillips right there.
Easy money!	Where'd you learn all this stuff?
So she's pretty cool, huh?	Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.	No shit?	Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
Out of the way, John!	No!  Don't kill him!	It, John.  Not him.  It.	Alright, it!  We need it!
We're better off by ourselves.	But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.	I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.	Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will.
Yeah.  Drag, huh?	I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
Mom?  You okay?	I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?	Uh huh.
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.	I love you, John.  I always have.	I know, Mom.  I know.
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.	Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
I got it.  Piece of cake.	Go!  I'll finish here.
Ready to rock?	Ready.
John, get out of the way!!	SHOOT!!!!
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.	Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
I love you.  I always will.	Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
They took him from me.	It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.	I know!	Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.	I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.	Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
Kyle, don't go!	There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.	And what it that?
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.	I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.	If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory.	I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?	You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
You broke my arm!	There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!	Open the goddamn door!
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?	Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
Can it be destroyed?	Unknown.
You look like handmade shit.	So do you.
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?	Correct.
"My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to ""read-only"" when we are sent out alone."	Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?	No.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.	Why him?	In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.	Then what?
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.	Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?	Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.	And Skynet fights back.
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.	Why attack Russia?	Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.	Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?	I have detailed files.	I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
The CPU from the first terminator.	Son of a bitch, I knew it!
I must be destroyed.	Can you get us in there, past security?
Is it safe for them here?	Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.
It's finally over.	No.  There is another chip.
Are you afraid?	Yes.
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --	Please continue...
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!	I'm sure it feels very real to you --	On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?	Relax now, Sarah --	You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
Where do you stand on all this?	On all what?	On Furtwängler.	I don't know.
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.	Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.	Our duty is to help Furtwängler with his defence,  That's why I want you to look at this...  These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg. We can't get them translated fast enough. But I guess you understand German, right?
That's because you had a proper upbringing.	That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!	Oh! And don't wave your hands about!	Respect your elders and your betters!	And no elbows on the table!	Eating is eating... and...	And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.	Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
What does he mean, too correct?	I don't know.
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.	But I promised your mother.
Yesterday I read that Furtwängler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.	When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.	When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?	I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'	And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.	For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.	I'm very sorry.	I'm Steve. What's your name?	David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.	Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?	I guess so, sir.	You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
Where you from, David?	was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
I guess you admire musicians.	Some.	Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same.
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?	I guess it's possible.	So, what does the Russki want?	Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.	'Dim-shits'?
What the hell are they doing?	They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?	Yes.	So what is it?	The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.	What's that mean?	I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.	Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?	Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.	That's big of him.
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.	Five minutes.	It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi.
You have a question for Helmuth, David?	Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
Yes, David?	Why not show Dr. Furtwängler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?	Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...	David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now?  Did you hear the question?
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?	Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!	You bet.	and totally irrelevant.	Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.	But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
What?	Your manner.	My manner? Why don't you go downstairs, get a cup of coffee and calm down? What's the matter, Emmi? What's going on with you? What's wrong?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?	Yeah.	When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?	With more what? More what?	Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.	David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?	Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.	A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.	Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.	What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.	Colonel. Pleasure.	So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?	Not yet.	I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.	Furtwängler's in a different category.	We're dealing with degenerates here.
A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.	That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.	Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?	But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?	Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!	Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.	In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.	This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.	There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.	What museum?	I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me.  Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwängler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.	No can do.	Let Furtwängler go. Please.	I have a duty.	Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.	Then you're going to kill me.
You live here, in Berlin?	Yes.	You do shorthand and typing?	Yes.
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?	Three months.	Says here because of your father. What's that mean?	My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.	Your mother, too.	Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.	And your father was executed.
Steve.	There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
Think you can get me any of that?	Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.	Mine's the Eleventh.	But... he only wrote nine, Major.	I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?	No. Ours was damaged.	What's in those files?	The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?	You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.
I'm sorry.	Come in, Emmi, this is your office, too. Emmi, this is Lieutenant David Wills.
Major, Major... he's here ...	Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.	Do you know where the Adagio begins?	Of course.	Put it on ready to play, and I'll tell you when to play it.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.	What is this, Emmi?	I can't do this. It's not right.	What's not right?	I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.	Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.	But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.	If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?	I would like to go now, please.
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?	I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.	What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.	That is correct.
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?	I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.	What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.	I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.	Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?	Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?	I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.	That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?	That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.	How come?	Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
I made no deal!	I don't buy that.	It's the truth.
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?	I don't remember in detail, there were so many.	Did you call someone you knew?	I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.	Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.	May I ask a question?	Sure.	When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?	Your guess is as good as mine.	I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...	Tough, tough!	Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?	I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?	It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.	Why were they going to arrest you?	I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.	You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?	During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.	You sure knew a lot of people in high places.	It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.	You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?	If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...	They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?	See, David? He can't answer the question. I'll ask it again, Wilhelm, and don't give me any more airy-fairy, intellectual bullshit!
Steve Arnold...	I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwängler, do you know Hans Hinkel?	Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.	Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?	Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone	Who?	I wasn't told. I just knew it.	How?	I was warned.	Who warned you?	Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.	What did Goering say?	He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.	Oh boy, you're gonna love this. Take your time with this now. Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful.
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.	Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
If it's too hot, open your tie.	I wish to say something.	Go ahead, be my guest.
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.	And what was that?	Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.	Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?	I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.	And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?	What telegram?	'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'	I have no idea what you're talking about.	The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.	I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.	Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.	I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.	Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.	Then you are wrong.	Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?	We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.	You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?	have no idea what ordinary people thought.	No!	No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.	Tell me about von der Null.	Von der Null?	Yes, von der Null.	Von der Null?	How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.	Yes, I know who he is.	Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?	That's an outrageous lie!	You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?	Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.	And what did he say?	He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'	And what happened to Von der Nul?	I have no idea.	You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.	I'm sorry.	Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.	I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?	Yes, that's what happened.
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.	This is absolute nonsense!	Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?	Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
I have illegitimate children.	What?	I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.	You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
Stop this, please, stop this now!	No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.	I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.	But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.	I don't understand what you mean.	No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?	Those attitudes do not exist in me.	I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.	Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Do you know what that is?	Of course I know what that is.	Okay, so what is it?	Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.	Who's conducting?
How can I know such a thing?	I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!	I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?	Look around you. See the country you served. Look at people who had real courage, who took risks, who risked their lives. Like Emmi's father.
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?	It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.	Me? Never.  Never.
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwängler today?	I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.	Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience?
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.	Do you know Hans Hinkel?	Do I know Hans Hinkel?	That's what I asked.	Do I know Hans Hinkel?	You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?	Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.	Do you know what's in this archive?	How could I know what's in the archive?
Major.	Helmuth.	Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?	Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
It's Dr. Furtwängler's baton, which I stole.	The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.	Yes, you remember.	How could I forget?
Show me.	Show you?	Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.	Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...	Do it, Helmuth.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.	Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.	Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.	So. You wanted to see me.
You usually don't work on Sunday, Major?	All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?	What?	One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
Was a member of...?  Speak up?	I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.	Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?	You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that -
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.	Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...	Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here?  This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning?  I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts.
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.	Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
I've remembered something else...	Yeah?	Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.	He did?	One of your people told me.	One of my people?
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.	Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?	No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.	Never heard of him, who is he?	Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.	Who's he?	Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwängler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.	The Miracle Kid.	Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
And ask him about his private life.	His private life?
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwängler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwängler.	But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.	He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.
Oh! The evening before, I see...	Yes, Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.	Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret?
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.	Yes.	Was looking at Furtwängler like that?	I don't know what you mean, Major.	When you got to the crescendo.
So, you never heard of him.	Nope.	Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?	Sure.	He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.	Jeez, and I never heard of him.
You were in insurance before the war.	Right. Claims assessor.	Conscientious, determined, dogged.	They said I was dogged?	Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.	Like this bandleader.	Well, he's more than just a bandleader, Steve. He's a great conductor, a gifted artist. But we believe that he sold himself to the devil. Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party. Don't be impressed by him. I want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. Find Wilhelm Furtwängler guilty. He represents everything that was rotten in Germany.
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?	First oboe.	I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.	Absolutely not.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -	Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
Dr. Furtwängler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.	Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?	It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.	He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?	Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...	Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.	It was Beethoven's Ninth.	Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
Yes, Chuck?	Come to the office, please.
Mission control to Chuck, come in...	You're late.
Aren't I worth waiting for?	Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?	I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.	The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.	Thanks, Chuck.  I need the money.  Can I still work the hours around my classes?
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.	Alright!	Can you handle it?	It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.	I won't let the fat kid down.
Anything else?	A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...	Just what you see, pal.
The Uzi 9 millimeter.	You know your weapons, buddy.
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?	All.
You can't to that...	Wrong.
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.	That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.	I'll do the same for you sometime.
What do you think?	Great.
Great.	You're a big help.	Alright, the beige one.	I hate the beige one.	Don't wear the beige one.
Not lately.  Did you check messages?	I thought you did.
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.	
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.	We will, kiddo.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.	What's it to ya?	You must have a girlfriend.	That's none of your business.	Aha!  Is she young?
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?	What's it to ya?
Do you understand?	Yes.  Don't hurt me.	I'm here to help you.  Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.	No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.	Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...	Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.	Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.	No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years.
So, it's from the future, is that right?	One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.	And you're from the future too?	Right.
Just let me go.	Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
There's so much...	Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.	I don't understand...	Defense network computer. New. Powerful.  Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all.  They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence.  Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.  Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.	The what?	Hunter Killers.  Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.
You cold?	Freezing.	Come here.
Reese...you got a first name?	Kyle.	Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?	White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
I caught one, back there.	Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
We gotta get you to a doctor.	It's okay.  Forget it.	Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.	What?	Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?
What's he like?	You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.	Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.	John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...	Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?	I volunteered.	You volunteered?	It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
I'm sure.	Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.	And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?	You'll learn.	Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.	"John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah""...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all."
Good field-dressing.	You like it?  It's my first.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.	Okay.  Talk some more.	About what?	About where you're from.
Bag some Z's?	Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
Thanks a lot.	What's that?
That's where we're going.	Why?
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?	What about it?	Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...	Molecular-memory.	Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?	That's the way it was told to me.
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.	Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.	Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.	That's not my mission.	Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.
Let's go.  Time to move out.	Fuck you!  Let go of me!
Kyle?	I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
Is this enough?	Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.	Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
What's that?	Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.	You must have had a fun child-
That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.	I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...	Hot dogs?	I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.	My whole life has been combat.	I want it to be over for you.	Not possible.	I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
He'll find us, won't he?	Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...	Don't say that.	If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.	It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.	No.  I'm not.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?	Good fighters.	That's not what I meant. Was there someone special?	Someone?	A girl.  You know.	No.  Never.
So much pain.	Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.	And so you feel nothing.	It's better that way.	Oh, Kyle.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...	Kyle...
I bet you're ticklish.	Ticklish?
What are you doing?	You'll beg for mercy in a second.
I don't think I like this.	You're not supposed to.
Sarah.	We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
What are you doing?	Cover...our footsteps...
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?	With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--	The year 2027?
And who was the enemy?	SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.	I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?	Yes.
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.	Then how are you supposed to get back?	Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.	Why?	I didn't build the fucking thing.	Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...	Surrounded by living tissue.	Of course.
Why were the other two women killed?	Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
You've heard enough.  Decide. Are you going to release me?	I'm afraid that's not up to me.	Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
I can help you...	Who is in authority here?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...	I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?	Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.	Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
Here, drink some of this...	Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.	They've already been identi- fied.  There's no doubt.
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?	I guess so.  You're a doctor?
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.	I can't sleep.	Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.	Okay.
Give me the short version.	Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--	That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
Here's her driver's license.	You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.	I hate the weird ones.
That stuff's two hours cold.	I know.	I put a cigarette out in it.
Did you reach the next girl yet?	No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.	Send a unit.	I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.	Call her.	I just called.	Call her again.
Same shit.	I can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'Phone Book Killer'.	I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?	To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?	Like shit, boss.
Go!  Go!  He's got her.	Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--	Shut up.
You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.	Projections were far too optimistic.	Admittedly...	Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.	But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.	Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?	My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.	The stock will turn.	It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?	Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...	You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.	You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...	What?	Your father was a friend.  Goddamn it... I watched you grow up.  How do you end up treating me like this?
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?	Now, look...	"I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not ""stepping down.""  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares."	There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.	"Remember Daniel Grant?  Do they say, ""without Daniel Grant, there is no Baer/Grant Publishing?""  He's gone sailing, Alan.  He's out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are."
I could fight you on this.	You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
Are you finished?	No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.	We met, this morning.  I signed the termination contract for Baer/Grace. I accepted your settlement, Nicholas. you were right.  I'm going sailing.
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.	Did you?  Kudos.
Did you play recently?	Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.	I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.	You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.	I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...	"""Whereas once I was blind, now I can see.""  Night, Nick.  Best of luck."
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...	Then, you kiss his ass.
You don't talk to me like that.	I apologized, I offered to help.	Clean out your locker.	Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.	I'll be right with you.
I'm so sorry.	Please, don't do that...
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...	A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.	It was an accident.	Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.	I said I was sorry...
Pardon me... Miss... ?	Oh, no... you.
I'm not sure how this works.  Do you have something for me... ?  I got this note...	What are you babbling about, psycho?	I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?	What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
Excuse me, I need to explain...	Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
What's with him?	I don't know... he fell.
Do you know what to do?	I don't think he's breathing.
Oh, God... !	Don't just stand there, get help!	This can't be real...	He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!	Alright... okay...	He's turning blue!
This is nuts.	What <u>is</u> your problem?	Ten minutes ago, I'm looking forward to a quiet dinner.  I get a note...
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...	Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
You've got to be kidding.	What... is... happening... ?
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.	A game?	It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.	What are you talking about?	The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...	You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?	I'm sorry, about this...	You should be.
There's got to be a flashlight.	I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
See you around.	Where are you going?	Home.	How do you know that's the way?
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?	It was a gift... from my brother.	How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.	Never mind.
Don't even think about it.	Why not?	"Read what it says: ""Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... """	If there was one.	"""... wait for help.""  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to."	Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
I'll give you a boost.	You first.	This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?	You pull me up.	It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...	No.	Please...	I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.	Oh.  FIne.
There's a ladder here.	My hero.  Let's go.
I'll wait.	It's not like anyone could actually open it.
This is C.R.S.	What's C.R.S.?	Consumer Recreation Services.  It's their building.  They...
Don't panic.  When security gets here, we simply explain what happened...	They'll love that.	Yes... well...
You deserted me.	You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.	You're the one who started running.	Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
There goes a thousand dollars.	Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?	That one did.	... two hundred dollars a toe.
Never did catch your name.	Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.	Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you, a czar?
That's classic.	Why... ?
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.	I think not.
Where are we going?	That tall, bright building.  Near there.
What exactly do you do?	Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
Nice.	Hm?  Oh, yes.
A fresh shirt...	If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.	I don't spend much time looking out the window.  I'll call you a taxi.
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.	Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
Goodnight.	I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.	The maitre d' called you Christine.	Right.  Call me Christy.	Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.	Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.	Keep it.
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.	Seriously?  What did they say?	They said five hundred.  I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit.  I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
What are you doing here?	Can we talk?	It's okay, dad.
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.	Come here...
What is it?	Is this you?	Where'd you get this?	It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?	I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?	Well... the red bra.	Okay.	I thought...
Do you mind if I sit?	Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...	I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.	Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay?  Be right back.
Want anything to drink?	You?	Yeah.  First Communion.  Aren't I a little angel?
Take the picture out.	What's wrong?	Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.	I don't...
They're watching.	Wha... ?	Not here!  They can see.
No!  I'm sick of this...	Nicholas...
What is this!?	God, wake up, it's a con!
What are you doing... ?	Get out.	I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...	Get out of my car!	You don't have a choice.  No one else is going to tell you what's going on.
You can talk while I drive us to the police.	No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
"Who are ""they?"""	I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.	Then, what good are you?	I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.	That's a lie...	Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.	How?  How could they have gotten anything?	They did the same to him as they did to you.	What are you talking about... ?
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?	Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.	They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
What did you say?	I didn't say anything.
My name's not Christine.  It's not my real...	Who the fuck cares?
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.	It might be best if we didn't talk.	All I mean is... someone like you...	How many times have you done this? I'm interested.	What?	Scams, con games.  How many?	I don't know.  A lot.	Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
Who is it?	What do we do?
Who is it?	What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.	What... what do you mean?	It's out of your hands.
What are you <u>doing</u> here?	I'm back from the dead.	Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
Get us out of here...	Nicholas...	Get us out!
What do you think you're doing?	You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?	How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...	Who's responsible?!	It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...	You call them...
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.	Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
They won't...	They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
Where'd you get that... ?	... what... ?	That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
What the fuck are you... ?	Where'd you get that gun?	It's mine...	We searched the house.	Guess you missed it.	Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...	What are you doing?	Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...	Fuck you.
Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game.	Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...	No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?	I saw them kill him!	What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!	Stop talking to them!	Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...	Stop talking...	Nicholas...	Shut up!	Let me show you...
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...	You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...	That's not true...	It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...	No...	Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...	Stop it!	Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
Don't move, you bitch... !	I have to show you...	No!
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.	That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.	I didn't know what else to call you.	Claire.	Claire.  Pleased to meet you.
I have to get to the airport...	Where are you going in such a hurry?	There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.	What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?	Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.	I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.	Like what... my favorite color... ?	Like... where are you from?	Originally, Connecticut.	Big family... small?	One brother, one sister.	Studied acting, I assume?	Julliard, yeah.	Single?	Yes.	Boyfriend?	No.	Underwear?	Always.
Hey there, Nickie.	Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.	Happy Birthday, man.	"""Seymour Butts.""  I never get tired of that one."	That's why it's a classic.  Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
They gave me a free jacket at the door.	They'll be wanting it back.	Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.	Which grad-school?
You look good.	So do you.  And to think I was worried...	About me?	How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?	Never better.	Elizabeth?	Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.	Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?	I redecorated.  What about you?	Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?	Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?	Yeah.	You need anything?	No.	Really?	I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
For you.	You shouldn't have.
Call that number.	"""Consumer Recrreation Services."" What, do they make golf clubs?"	Trust me.  Call that number.	Why?	They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.	Fun?	You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.	This isn't an escort service?	It's a profound life experience.	Like a stroke?	Call them.  Trust me.
Tell me you'll call.	Okay.	Will you?	I said I would...	But, will you?	Are you still on mediction?	Why would you say that?
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T...	I'll call them, okay?	It doesn't matter...	I'm going to call.	Do it for YOU.	Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.	I know...
Tell me where we're going.	Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!	What's this all about, Connie?	Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
What are you doing?	They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.	Who?	C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.	Yeah, almost...	You dodged a bullet.	How do you mean, exactly?	They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.	Slow down, take a breath...	It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...	What have they been doing to you?	Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...	Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?	You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
It's them.  They did this.	It's a flat tire.  That's all.	How do you know?	We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.	Okay... okay.
The phone's dead.	Really?	Do you know how to change a tire?	No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
How did those... ?	You're part of it...	What?  Connie...
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!	No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...	You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!	Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?	Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...	Stop this.  It's not true...	I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?	Stop it!
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...	Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
What?	This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
Really?	Yeah.	Split it?	Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.	Where's Christine?  The waitress.	Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.	Did she?
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?	Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...	It always is.
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...	Robbed?	Yes.	Have you gone to the police?	I don't speak Spanish.  All I need is to get back... just enough for that.
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?	Yes.	And, they didn't take that watch?
How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.	Yes, very lucky.
I need your car, Elizabeth.	What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...	I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.	Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.	There's nothing to forgive.	It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.	Of course, Nick...
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.	Yes.
I'll explain someday.	I hope.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.	You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.	Happy Birthday, Nicholas.	I'll call.  I really will.	I know.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.	I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...	Oh, here we go...
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...	What is?
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...	No, thank you.	You need to fill out those forms. Application, psych-tests: M.M.P.I. and T.A.T.  For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like.  We'll run a T.R.W....
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.	What's all this for?	We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...	No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?	Oh... it's a game.	A game?	Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.	What kind of vacation?	It's different every time.	Humor me with specifics.	We provide whatever's lacking.	And if nothing's lacking?	May I make two suggestions... ?	Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?	First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.  Second, you don't have to decide today.  Take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  One day, the game begins.  You either love it or hate it.  Decide then.  We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  That was my sales pitch.
How long will these take?	An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.	Physical?	Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
Sorry to keep you waiting.	"Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your ""crack team""."	It's all down to this...
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.	You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?	It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.	You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.	That's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.
Get rid of them.	Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.	I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.	Nobody knows, pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
Goddamnit, why do they do that?	How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.	They own the whole building.  They just move from floor to floor.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.	No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...	Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.	What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
Drive in.	What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.	I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard.
You don't need me...	Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
Where?	I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.	Where'd you pick up your checks?	It was a different floor then...	Guess!	Like, this way... sort of...
I need the police.	Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
You know, these fit... perfectly.	They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
I've been so lonely.	I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.	Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.	Don't take another step.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.	First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...	Have we met?
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.	The key?	Hm?	Is there a room key?	Didn't I give you two?	No, you didn't...
Thank you.	Have a nice day.
Dinner's in the oven.	Thank you.  Goodnight.
You did?  How is he?	Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.	Well... send my love, if you see him again.
Is everything alright?	Fine.	I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?	No, thank you.  Goodnight.	Goodnight then.
Mr. Van Orton... ?	Ilsa... you're alright?	Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?	Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?	I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?	There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
What makes you ask?	I'm not sure.
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.	He came to my mind recently, that's all.
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.	Was he morose, or...?  I mean...	No.  What happened... no one expected it.	Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.	Not much, I think.	I'm just like him.	You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.	Did you worry about him?	Nobody worried about your father.
Goodnight.  See you home.	Goodnight.  Where was she?
What's the trouble?	You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.	Your brother.  Will you come with me?	What's this about?	It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...	Where's my brother?
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.	His behavior... ?	He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...	Look, where is he?!	There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone...
Invitations: the Museum Gala.	No.	The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.	No.	The Hinchberger wedding.	Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...	I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?	Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
Your ex-wife.	I know who she is.  Take a message.
I don't like her.	I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...	What?	A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...	What gentleman, Maria?	A Mister... Seymour Butts.
"""Under the Bleachers""... by Seymour Butts."	Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...	Cancel lunch.  Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts.
What the fuck... ?!	Why are you following me?	I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm just driving...
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...	"Is Alan Baer ""the Game?""  Is that what this is?"	Friend... why don't you back off.
Hey... !	Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Anything wrong... ?	Nothing.  Nothing at all.
I wasn't expecting you.	Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
Attractive...	Don't ask.	I checked it personally.
What's happened...	Follow me.
Nicholas...	That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
How concerned should I be?	It was a misunderstanding.
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?	You know you can.	Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.	Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?	Just what I told you.	Nothing else?
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?	You're joking.	It's what they do.  It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  Depraved children.
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.	Sam...  Thank you.
He hasn't called back.	What about the house?
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...	Attempted murder.
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.	You warm my heart.
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.	Greetings fellow insomniac.	Greetings fellow sheep counter.
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?	It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?	What?	<u>Every</u> year is a good year.
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...	Uh... Nell Vance...	And what kind of sleeper?	Well, I... uh...	Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.  And you?  I'd guess...
I only saw Theo drive up.	Who's Watts?
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.	Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?	I did okay.
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?	It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  You brought us here to scare us.  Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  You're disgusting.	Is this true?  I've been hypnotized?
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.	Greetings.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?	I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
That could have been worse.	Yeah.
Luke, can I talk to you?	Sure.	Because... well, I know I can trust you.	Why?	I've read your tests.
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.	Go ahead.
And those are Luke's and mine.	There's a carriage house around back.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.	Do we still get paid for the week?	You get your money.
Is that the question of compassion or science?	It's a question.	She got the child labor stuff from me.
It's not going to hold your weight.	Just stay there, Nell!
You're not telling us something.	Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.	Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.	And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
Hey!  I heard screaming...	Luke.
Well, this lot is full!	He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
I didn't do it.	You could have.	So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?	No.
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?	The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.	You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?	That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.	All night?	Yeah.	You want company?	Maybe someday.
You used the wrong test.	Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
Nell --	-- how much is this car worth?
Was sure she'd be in here.	Where in the hell can she be.
Nell!	We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
It's still an electric shock!	Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.	And that will be a good place to end this study.	No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...	Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!	But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results.  The deception is minor.
Are you working with her?	Mary, I'll meet you outside.
Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.	And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.	You don't believe in the paranormal.	No, but she does, and that's all that matters.	Does she know that's why you're using her?	No.	I, I just can't...	She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.	I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.	This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
Eleanor, how was the drive?	You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow.	Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.	I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.	Well... we're glad to have you.
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.	Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
All the carvings.	But there's a sad catch to the story.
The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?	Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?	How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing?  Water hammer, something like that?
Sorry.	For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
Nell!  What's wrong?	That smell... oh, God.
What did it smell like?	It was very specific.	All right...	In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.	So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.	I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.	What happened after you smelled it?	I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.	Like she smelled it too?	Yes.	And then what happened?	I got more scared.
Hmm.	I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.	No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something.
Are you coming to confess?	I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?	I don't know.	It was a stupid thing to do.	It was.	Welcome Home.	You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?	Sure.
Someone is playing with you.	Why?	I don't know.	It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
What is that tune?	I don't know.  A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on.  Hugh Crain, would you care to dance?
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...	And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.	It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
Why would we want to do that, Nell?	Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.	Nell.  You will come here now.
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!	Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.	Then who called me?
No.	My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
Come on.	No --
What'll happen to us, Nell?	Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
You know what he's really upset about?	What?	You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.	Test it.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.	How'd I know it was for you?	Because it's my phone.  Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you.
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.	Good.
What's this?  What's this... this picture?	That?  That's Hill House.	This is where we're going?	Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
What happened?	There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
Have either of you seen David Watts?	No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
When do we take the tests?	Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
Well this is a cozy breakfast.	Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
Maybe they're Mary's.	Mary came with me.
Get a blanket!	It's okay... we're all here...
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.	How could you do this to people?
Is she asleep?	Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
She needs help.	I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.	No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
Oh God, we can't get out!	Nell, what do we do?
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?	I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.	But the experiment was a failure.
What do you want?	Oh!  You scared me.	Me?  No.  What are you doing here?	Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?	Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?	I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
Why do you need a chain like that?	That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
Is there something about the house?	Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
That's where she hanged herself.	Who?	Rene Crain.  Up there.  Rope. Ship's hawser.  Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it.
Why?	Why'd she kill herself?	Yes.	She was unhappy.	Why?	Can't say.  Haven't been here that long.  Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.
It's make the soup or answer the door.  Can't do both.	Mrs. Dudley.	So far.
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?	I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.	Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here.
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.	Why would we --	-- no one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.  No one will come any nearer than that.  In the night.  In the dark.
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.	No one will come any nearer than that.
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.	This?  It's from a thrift shop.	What did it cost?	Fifteen dollars.	That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!	It's all I could afford.	Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?	I don't know what you mean.
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.	That's why we're here.	What do you do?	I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?	That depends.
Not really.	Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.	Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.	My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?	No.	A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?	I don't have anyone.  But I do have a little apartment of my own.  It has a little flower garden.  You can just see the ocean.  At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
Jeez.	I know.
I love this house.  I really love this house.	You're okay.
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.	The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?	Yes.  I've missed it.	No.  The world has missed you.
Good night, Theo.	You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.	You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?	I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
How could he have left without his keys?	Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
Watts?	What's his first name?	David.	David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
David?	Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
Is it over?	No, it's getting worse.
Theo... Did you?	Maybe you did it yourself.	Why?	I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
That's so sad.	There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.	Before he painted your name over Mister Crain.
Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.	I don't know what to think anymore.	Just think about one thing right now: What color?
I've never had a pedicure before.	Well?	Red.  What else?
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.	Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?	I have a loft.
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?	I don't know, you know...
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?	I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
Are you sure?	I think so.	Okay.
Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --	-- What do you think?
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.	Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
Nell, what happened?	Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!	Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.	-- but the painting!
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.	I don't think I want any.	I do.
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!	Come on!  Why are we waiting?
What'd you come back for, babe?	Just had to be sure.
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.	Then let's go get you one.
Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.	I used to hate it.  Now I like it.	Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?	I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.	Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.	Then what good is he?	Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?	Is that a problem?	Not for you, clearly.	I'm loyal to things that make me happy.	Am I a thing?	Well, you're certainly not a person.	I'm not.	No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.	I'm so glad we're having this chat.	It's not a knock.	It's not a compliment.	It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?	As soon as you get dressed.	What kind of food?	Anything but Japanese.	Why?	I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.	Like you.	I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.	You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.	It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.	For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.	That's what Gordon's always saying.	Oh, god.
Italian?	I'm sorry.	Italian.	Who?	Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.	Sure.
I like the colors.	We all did.	It must've been a time.  A golden moment.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.	I'm a gracious host.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.	All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
What's the matter?	Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.	The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.	Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.	I sure hope so.
We think someone is here.	We think?	We can't find ...  ... two of our guys.
No.	Why not?	Because --
Hey.	Come over here.
How they goin', kid?	Not bad.	How'd you like to kill someone for me?	Okay.
Same as last time -- the rest after.	Where do we go?	When you find the guy, you'll know.	What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.	I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.	This is un-fucking professional.	See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.	Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.	That's why I'm letting you take care of this.  I'm the one with appearances to maintain.  But who gives a shit about you?  Not even God.
What.	There's been some trouble downtown.	What kind?	"What the papers used to call a ""gangland slaying."""	Our black friends?	No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.	I thought he was in prison, in England.	Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.
You should have let me do the talking.	Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.	What did you tell them.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.	Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.	As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.	And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.	I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split.  Maybe he was Gordon's <u>pusher</u>.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.	We'll find him.	No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.	You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.	You think I'm staying?	There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.	Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me.
You broke last time.	Let him break - he likes to break.	Fuck you.	I wouldn't talk.	Huh?	I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
Oh really?  Where you from?	England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.	You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?	Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.	You're in gun country now, my friend.	Been to the Boat Show.	Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece.
I can take care of the paperwork.	Yeah?	No problem.  If <u>you</u> don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen.
Man knows what he likes.	Lookin' good.	That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.	What'd you call that -- the Protector?	Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market.
CQ what?	Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
Edward Rama?	Eduardo.  Rama.	You're home, then.
I didn't expect anyone.	No reason.	I mean, what has it been -- six months?	Round about, yeah.
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.	It was better than a telegram.
Who done it, then?	Huh?	Snuffed her.
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.	No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.	Terry Valentine.	Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?	I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
What more is there.	I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that.	No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.	I dunno ... Maybe they do.
Boomerang.	Y'what?	I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.	This ain't your lot?	You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth.
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.	I only asked.
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?	That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.	Where abouts?
Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.	Did Jenny know?	Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing <u>them</u>.  Checking <u>them</u> out.  I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?	Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.	Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ...  Those curves don't kid around.
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.	She didn't write to me, did she.	She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.	Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?	Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.	I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.	I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.	Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.	But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man.
You're kiddin' me, right?	What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?	These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.	Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?	Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.	Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.	Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.	Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?	Not me, man.	I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one?
You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.	Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.	It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?	Five years, I think.  Long time.	Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
"Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a ""private"" service.  Private for who. Him?"	Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.	He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.	And that's where you met Jenny.	No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.	How'd the two of you hook up, then?	Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.	Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.	Who'd you butcher at the house?	Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.	Huh?	He's brought in the heavy mob.	What?	Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.	Has he?	They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
That was one of them?	See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
What's so fucking funny?	Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?	<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.	I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.	Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.	No one else is even here yet.	First in, first out, that's me.
What are we standing on?	Faith.
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?	You goin' back inside?	One thing I need.
Steady on.	You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.	That would be too easy.	Too easy?	He's gotta know why.	You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will?  What more do you want, man?
I've been wondering something.	Again?	Do you have any friends, man?	Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.	What post office?	The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
What d'you say, Elaine?	Not much -- you?	Same.	Uh-huh.	Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?	Probably.	I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.	Really.	Didn't get it.	Well, those are the breaks.	Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.	You just cooking then?	Hell, no.  I started writing.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?	No, but I know what he means.
... Reminds me of Jennifer.	Hard to miss.
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.	I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
Had a feeling it was you.	You look alike.	Perhaps it was the smoke.	Not her brand.	She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
Why did you come here?	Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?	No, why did you come here?
Sort a few things out.	Been busy, have you.	How d'you mean?	It's been a while.	I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.	That's not what I heard.	What was that, then?	"I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- ""at Her Majesty's pleasure."""	It was the bars, then.
In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.	Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.	And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?	Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.	Well, that kind of security can't be bought.  Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.	Try calling me again.
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.	Sounds like Beverly Hills.	Here, are you always this sarky?	Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.	Weren't you on a television series?	If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?	Said it went on for donkey's years.	Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.	Oh, it just ended, then.	Now who's being sarcastic?	When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.	I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars.
I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.	Not embarrassed.	Ashamed.	Not ashamed.
Disappointed.	She never told Eddie, though.	She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.	How'd you manage that, then.	When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.	Yeah, well, she started all that in London.	Modelling.	Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.	In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.	She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.	Footloose and fancy free.	She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't.
When did you get in?	Yesterday.  Afternoon.	You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.	No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...	I might've been away for the weekend.	Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.	And you've seen Eddie Rama.	Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.	He give me your address.	I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.	Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.	Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?	Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?	Nah, accommodation address.	What's that, like a P.O. box.	Something like that, yeah.	Where you get your bank statements.
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.	That's what was estimated.	Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?	Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.	Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --	-- Your employer?	-- Mr. Lindgren.	Who's Mr. Lindgren?	My employer.	What line is he in.	Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.	I see.	Based in London, but with international concerns.	I bet.	Various enterprises, style of thing.	I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.	Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.	Right.	Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.	In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?	This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.	-- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.	Why not.	Are you serious.	Have you ever known me not to be.
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.	What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].	You don't believe it was a car accident.	What do you think.	Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.	Depends, don' it.	On what.  What makes you so certain.	I'll bloody well ask him.	There's the phone.  You want his number.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.	She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.	She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming <u>straight</u> to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.	You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.	And how did you get it?
"This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as ""the early 70's.""  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me."	Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.	These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
You don't seem bothered.	You don't know how I've compromised my standards.	Tell us about it.	It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.	Oh, I was gonna say ...	Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.	I can see the attraction.
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.	A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.	You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.	We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.	It didn't discourage you, though.	Hey?	From pursuing your chosen profession.	I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.	I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.	Did you.  What was that in aid of?	Who remembers.	Get seven years, did you?	Overnight.  What about just now?	Just now?  Overnight?	You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?	It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.	I don't believe it.	Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.	Pushing the legal limit even then.
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.	You ever been to London?	Only in the movies.	I've 'ardly ever left it.	Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.	I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.	Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
Not that I recall.	What about your grandmother?	Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.	He alive to see this?	Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.	What'd your father do?	Black market during the war.
I guess you're just habitual.	You sound like my fucking probation officer.	Won't he be looking for you about now?	Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.	Minor officials bother you, don't they?	Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.	A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.	I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.	She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.	Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.	Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
"She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  ""If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya.""  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  ""I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now"" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke."	She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.	I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it <u>wasn't</u> a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.
Where's Big Sur?	Up the coast.	How far?	I don't know -- few hours, I guess.	Fancy it?	I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.	Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.	What's in Big Sur?	That's where Valentine's scarpered.	How do you know?	Bloke told me.
Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.	You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...	Poor baby.
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.	Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.	Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.	Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.	I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.	But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.	Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.	Yeah, I guess you are.	Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.	That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.	Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.	So what's your beef, pal?	Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.	It was you.  Downtown.	Eh?	Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.	No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.	He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.	All of what?	Of the deal, man.	Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.	But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.	As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.	In which case I'll just do what I usually do.	And that is?	What am I doing?
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.	My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.	A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.	Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.	Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?	My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.	So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.	He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.	Where is he now?	He had urgent business in the north.
Don't you work with Ian?	Ian?	I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.	Sorry.  Wasn't me.	You sure?	Unless I'm not who I think I am.	That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.	Yeah?	Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.	No kidding.	What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?	Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.	Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.	Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
Yeah, that's right.	I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
I would have preferred staying home, me.	You're a reluctant traveller, then.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.	Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.	No rest for the wicked.
Been away a lot.	Where else?
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.	Nine years?  Is that legal?	Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.	But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.	I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.	Sounds like you need a rest.	Could do, yeah.
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.	The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.	Yeah.
How much.	Five thousand.	Hey.	I got half.	Makin' trouble for someone?	Yeah.	Which kind?	The forever kind.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.	Good luck.	Jesus, are you gay enough or what.	Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.	... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.	Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.	Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.	Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?	Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?	I don't know.	The L.A.P.D.
Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.	Avery said she was tight with his daughter.	That don't mean nothin'.
She's nice lookin'.	So what.	I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.	And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?	What d'you mean, any happier?	Any happier than any other asshole in life.
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.	Lemme break.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.	There's more than a measly few grand in this.	There is?	Something's on.	What?	I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.	You do?	You bet.	Like what.	"Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs ""plausible denial."""	Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.	"""He ain't wrong.""  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job."	I don't get it.	I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.	What's in it?	Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.	How we gonna get that lucky?	While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
How'd you get in here.	Walked.	You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.	Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
He's expecting you?	I doubt it.
So why would he want to see you.	I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.	Jennifer Wilson.
You know her?	Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
Is Valentine here?	What do you think?
Where is he, then?	Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
Hello there.	What are you doing here?	Exercising my visitation rights.	Since when?	I miss my kids.	They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
You've made it ... brighter.	I don't want you here, Terry.	Sure you do.
What kind of trouble are you in?	No trouble.
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.	Susan.
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --	-- You know his name is Frank.	Is he here?	You know I don't live with him.	Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --	Are you finished?	In a couple of days this whole thing --	Who's looking for you?	Go now.
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.	That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
Pleasure.	Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --	EMI in London.  I work with Ian.	Ah.	You must know Ian.	I don't.	Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.	I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.	Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking they can get away with things.  Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention.
Thanks.  You, too.	Be seein' you.
What.	Tell me.	Tell you ...	About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.	<u>Why</u> then.  Why did you do it!
Hello, Ed.	Ann. Will you come in?
...I'm so sorry about your loss.	Yes. Thank you.	Of course, you know, Doris had nothing to do with it. Nothing at all.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...	Yes, Ann?	And you should tell Doris...
Yes?	We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.
...Yes?	At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.	Ann--	A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.	Ann--	The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--	Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?	Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
...You don't like the music out there?	It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
Hello, Rachel.	I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.	Yeah. Thanks.
He was deaf when he wrote this.	Who?	Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.
Hi, Mr Crane.	Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.	Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.	Hello, Tony.
Hello, Mr Crane.	Hello, Birdy.	We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry.
Yeah.	We've certainly missed you.	Birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking. There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. Life has dealt me some bum cards...
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--	Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.	That's what he keeps telling me.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.	Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.	That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.	Boy.	You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--	Oh, Mr Crane--	I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.	Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.	I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.	Geez, Mr Crane.	Just see him, as a favor to me.
...I stank, didn't I?	He didn't say that.	But more or less.	Look, I'm no expert, but--	It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.	I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.	But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.	...Uh-huh.	I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.	Ah... it's nothing.	I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?	Huh.	You're an enthusiast.	Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
...I guess I've been all wet.	But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
...I wanted to make you happy.	Birdy--	It's OK...
...No, please.	Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
...You are ze fahzer?	No. Uh... family friend.
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?	Uh-huh.	Ah yes, a music lover.	Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.	Ah.
...Mm.	Well? How'd she do?
Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.	I don't understand.	Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.	Did she make mistakes?
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.	I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--	Ah, but that is just what I cannot teach. I cannot teach her to have a soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *Done* with the fingers, yes. But the music, she is inside. Inside, monsieur...
...she can go up there.	Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--	Then you listen to me, for I am expert. That girl, she give me a headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, I think, maybe, she make a very good typist.
A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?	Uh--	Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!	That right.	It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.	Huh.	That's right! Dry cleaning--remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on...
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?	Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.	I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.	Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop?	No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
You got the dough?!	I can get it, yeah.	Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?	No. I--tell me--	Sure.	What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?	Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.	And how do we share--	Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?	I'll have it in a week.	Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well...
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...	Ed.
...Was that a pass?	Maybe.	You're out of line, mister.
No problem!	Way out of line.	Right! Strictly business.	Yeah.
...You bring a check?	Cash.	Cash?!
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?	Sure.	I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?	Yeah.	Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--	It's OK.	Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point?
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--	That'll be fine.	Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.	Uh-huh.
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--	Look, uh... Creighton...
...You're not gonna screw me on this?	*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--	All right.	And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--	OK.
How ya doin', Ed?	OK. Take your coat, Ann?
...Were you in the service, Ed?	No, Dave, I wasn't.
...That's quite a wife you got there.	Mm.	She's a rare one.	How's business, Dave?	Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?	All right, I guess.	...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day.
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?	Specialty store down in Sacramento.	Uh-huh.
...Ed, I...	What is it, Dave?
Uh-huh.	Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.	Uh-huh.	Well, you know what that would do to me.	I guess it would be pretty awkward.	Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.	Uh-huh.	I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.	How much to they want, Dave?	$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.	...You know... who *who* is?	The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.	Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.	Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.	Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--	He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
...Oh, Jesus.	...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?	That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.	Mm.	Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn wife!
Please, Ed.	But it's...	Please, Ed.
Your place?	I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.	OK.
...Dave?	Come on in.
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.	So you paid the guy?
...What kind of man *are* you?	...Huh?	What kind of man *are* you?	Big Dave--	I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.	I, uh...	I'm not proud of what I did. But *you*.
Rye.	Just coffee.	You sure you don't want something stiffer?
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.	Told what?	I, uh... thanks.
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.	My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?	Honey?	Mm.
Where you going?	Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.	Yeah, right.
Come on, get ready. It's important.	Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.	Oh, don't be a grump.
...What a knucklehead.	Who?	Dave.	How's that?	Ahh...
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.	So?	*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*	Mm.
...What's so damn strange about that?	I didn't say a word.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.	Congratulations, Gina.	Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.	Honey...	It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, I'm sure.
Honey.	How are you?
I don't know what's going on. I--	What happened to you?
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.	You don't have to--	I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.	You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.	Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
Should I... should I tell you why?	You don't have to tell me anything.
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.	Honey...	I knew we'd pay for it.
...Doris--	Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?	No. Of course not. She didn't do it.	Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?	...OK.	Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No?
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.	Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--	It was Big Dave's.	--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.	*I* was with her.
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?	He and Doris... were having an affair.
OK, how did you know?	I... just knew. A husband knows.
Will anyone else say they knew?	I don't know. I don't think so.	How did you get into the store?	I took Doris's keys.	Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?	...I don't think so.	Will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all?
...I don't get it.	Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.	Yeah.	And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!	So... who... who actually--	Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try.
Not guilty, your honor...	I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...	...a puny player on the great world's stage...	...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...	...who among us is in a position to say...	...He told them to look at me--look at me close. That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that I was the barber, for Christ's sake...
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...	...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.	Oh, hell. Drink?	No thanks.	Sure you don't need one?	I'm fine.	OK. Boy. Jesus!	Yeah. What do I, uh...	Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.	He a good man?	Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...	So--	Taking it seriously.	So, who should I--
Coffee, Ed?	I'm fine. Thanks.	No thanks, honey.
...So, uh, who should I--	Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
...Probity.	Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...	Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.	Uh-huh. He's the, uh...	Yeah, the best.
Ed, how're you holding up?	I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.	Yeah.	Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.	Sure, Walter. Thanks.
...Huh?	Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?	I don't work here. My wife does.	Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?	Yeah.	Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.	Uh-huh.
...Did you make that up?	Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
That was quite something.	He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.	That was something. I'm Ed Crane.	I know who you are, Mr Crane.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.	Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.	Uh-huh.	How d'ya like them apples?
...Ed?	Huh?	Russians exploded an A-bomb.	Yeah.	Jesus...	Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?	Uh-huh.	The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.	Uh-huh.	Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?	Yeah.	Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...
...You sure, Eddie?	Yeah, yeah--go home.
Frank.	Huh?	This hair.	Yeah.	...You ever wonder about it?	Whuddya mean?	I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.	Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?	No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.	Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.	What the--	I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.	What the hell are you talking about?
...How you today, Ed?	OK.	You don't got a headache?	...Nah.	Damn, I got a headache to beat the band.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!	Yeah.	Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!	Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--	I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!	That's very generous.	The hell with it, Eddie!
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.	Uh-huh.	Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.	Uh-huh.	They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, how long has *this* place been here?
...We goin'?	Huh? No.
Huh?	They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.	My *wife*?
I don't understand.	He's the dead guy.
Birdy... I didn't mean to--	What'd he say?	Birdy...
'Lo, Ed.	Hello, Walter.
Mr...?	Crane. Ed Crane.	You also have an interest in the securing property?
...You're Ed Crane?	Yeah--	Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.	No thanks, I--
...I'm Crane.	My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.	Yeah?
Hello!	Hello.
Doesn't bother me.	Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?	We're just closing, friend.	Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!	Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
Yes, sir.	Could you come with me please?	Sure. Can Ed come too?
He's a barber.	Ah.	Second chair.	Not an owner.	No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.	Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.	They sent us to tell ya.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...	Homicide.	Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.	Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.	Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.
Are you awake?... Is he awake?	Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?	His eyes are open.	Uh... you're under arrest.	As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?	You'll go to the prison hospital.	Under arrest for murder.
What'd he say? Does he understand?	He said OK. Is that what he said?
Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.	It better be good.	There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?	No.
Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm getting nothing, Lieutenant.	Great.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.	I'm in.
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.	I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?	Someone broke into this room.	Anything missin'?	Doesn't look like it.  We're damned lucky.  This statue is priceless.
Looks like the curse is still at work.	The claws are sharp... I must have cut myself.  Better move these crates to the secure storage area where they'll be safe.
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.	Why not?	No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out.  That lock was torn off from the <u>inside</u>.
We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.	I appreciate that.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.	It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.	I'll go down and speak to him.	You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.	Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --	He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
Sweet Jesus!	Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.	My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!	I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.	If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.	I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.	We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.	Do they have to wear uniforms?	Yes.	I don't want to scare people.	I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems.  Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.	Where's the walk-in safe?	Behind you.	What's the combination?	I'll do it.  Just let me find my portable phone.
Forget it!	Calm down.  I found it!
Battery's dead.  Shit.	Let's go!
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.	Hurry up!	Just a minute.  I'm shaking!  Take the gun.
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!	To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...	Oh Jesus...
Fifteen... what's next?	Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.	The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.	It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.	That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?	In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.	That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?	You don't know much about computers, Lieutenant.  There are safeguards built in.  We have back-up systems with redundancies.  There's no way these computers can fail.
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!	What doors?	I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --	You said the system couldn't fail!
Ippolito!  Get back here!	Like hell!
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.	Where the hell are you?	I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.	It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
Who are you?  The undertaker?	Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.	Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?	Not at all.  I think we may be working on the same case.  If so, I could use your help.
The body?	What's left of it.	Mind if I have a look?
We need light in here, stat.	Where's the head?
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.	Whose footprints?	Night watchman who found the body. Sweet old man.  Been tossing his cookies for over an hour.  Not a likely suspect.
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.	Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.	In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.	I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?	Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.	Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
Lieutenant --	Call me Vince.	Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.	Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?	Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.	So the method of death is the only connection?	No.  There's more.  There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.
If you don't mind, this could be important.	You're kidding.	Unfortunately, no.
"I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than ""the dog ate my homework""."	How do you explain the part about Beauregard?	They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.	I believed them.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?	No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.	Oh.
What happened to them?	If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?	Correct.
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --	This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.	You've been holding out on me Pendergast.  You have a suspect capable of this?
How big is the sub-basement?	Apparently it's huge.	I think I should come with you.	We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!	This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.	The sub-basement?	I've been down there.  It links up to the old sewer system.  I can guide you out.
I smell it.  It's here.	Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!	Everybody.  Get behind me.
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.	The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
This place is a maze.	I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.	May I see that?
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!	Pardon my French, but bull shit.	This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?	The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
Lieutenant!  It's me.	What is it?	Dr. Green has to see you!	Got my hands full here.	It's important.  Please.  You have to come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found out something.
What happened?!	There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
It's still back there!	I know.
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?	You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.	Oh shit.
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.	Not so loud.
What's that?	All right everybody, hold up!
What does it say?	Dr. John Whittlesley.	What's that doing here?	I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?	I'd say we're in its home.
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.	Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.	I hope you liked it.	Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
What are we talking about here?	Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.	Right.  The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please?
Curious.  There's something missing.	The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?	Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --	I don't believe it.	Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.	We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.	That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news.  Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants?  Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.	Let me help.  I can take care of everything.	No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.	How can you say that?  You know it's not true.	Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --	My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.	With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.	Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.	Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.	I'm not giving up.	You must.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.	You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.	Everyone needs a change of scenery. I've been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years.  That's quite enough.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.	Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.	A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.	Let me see the plant press.
What is it?	I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.	Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.	You're right.
Margo, these aren't seed pods.	What are they?	They're eggs.
Like the claw.	Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.	Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.	Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.	That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.	"But a virus normally codes for other viruses.  This one's making human and animal proteins.  Listen to this.  ""Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4- monoxytocin supressin hormone."""
"All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  ""Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters."" That means it's highly intelligent. ""Quadrupedal."""	"Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  ""He Who Walks on All Fours."""
"""Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm""... poor eyesight.  ""External mucoid nasal glands,""... very keen scent... ""Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."""	So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.	With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.	Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.	And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...	It's like ringing the dinner bell.
What's going on?	Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?	I think so.
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?	Don't stop now.
What's that?	It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.	We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.	That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.
I'm coming with you.	No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
Come back and get me.	We will.	Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It hunts with its sense of smell.  So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
Dr. Frock?	Look who's here, Margo.
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.	Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.	How many storage areas are there?	They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?	Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
Something tried to get into this room!	And failed.  These doors are solid steel.	This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!	I wouldn't be so sure.
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.	Read it out loud.	"""Dear Louis, Tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we'll be in the greatest danger, so I'm sending Carlos back with the crates.  You always believed in me, Louis, even in the darkest days.  So it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded.  We've made an incredible find.  I enclose a representation of Mbwun.  Note the exaggerated claws, the reptilian attributes, the hints of bipedalia. It's beyond belief, but this statue is accurate.  I know because I've seen the beast."""
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.	Yes.	Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?	Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
Where is that?	I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.	You said you had plans of the museum.  Could we see them, please?
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.	I don't believe it.
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.	He's right.
What's that?	Footsteps!
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?	They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
You work here?	Yes, I do.	What do you do?	I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?	Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?	Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.	Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.	Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
This room sucks.	She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.	Let's ditch and find them ourselves.
We're not supposed to go back there.	Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
I don't want to go this way.	Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
Quiet!	What is it?	I don't know.  But I think it's bad.
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.	Big as a house.	Not that big.	Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.	Like this.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.	They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.	They were yellow!	You're color blind.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.	The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.	Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
They've got something.	Keep the light up.  I can't see.
Shut them up!	Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
Stop!	Holy mother, what is that?
Argo!  Hobbes!	Get back!  Now!
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?	He's right.  Follow me.
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.	Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.	It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?	Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
Oh... my... God!	Quiet.
Jesus, what is this?	Another storage room.
Oh no.  I smell it.	Keep the animal quiet.
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.	But at what a price.
I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.	Margo, you haven't heard?	What?	Frock's been fired.
That's impossible.	I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?	Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
Mbwun.	What's that?
What do you make of it, Margo?	It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.	Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.	There's another possibility.  A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
What kind of egg is it?	It's reptilian.
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!	What kind of hormones?
"4-monoxytocin is... ""A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."""	Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!	So what?	Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!	Eats them?	Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant.  When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
Is Dr. Frock safe!	Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.	How about lunch?	Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.	Okay.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?	An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.	How does it work?	With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.	No.  I came to talk about Dr. John Whittlesley.
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?	Maybe not.	If he were alive he'd have contacted me.	You have time to talk?
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.	And John?	Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.	I don't understand.	The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --	You loved him.	Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.	You were going to be married.	How did you know that?	I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.	That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.	You were afraid of him, weren't you?	He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.	Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?	A legendary monster called Mbwun.	A monster?	"Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a ""monster species"".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years."	What happened?	No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.	What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?	I don't understand.	Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.	My God.  Then it was an animal.	I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?	I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.	Would you mind showing it to me?
Where would we find it?	I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.	All right.  I'm as macho as you are. Perhaps.
What happened?	I don't know.	I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.	You were behind me?  Running after me?
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.	Where did you see it?	Behind me.  Over there.
That's not what I saw.	All right.  If you're positive.
Dr. Green...	I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?	They're all heavily armed.	All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.	What was it?	I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
Genetic damage?	When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.	We need someone to take us to the secure storage area.
Pendergast?  Are you all right?	No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
You're not.  Where is it?	Gone.	Wounded?	No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.	That would fit.  It's nocturnal. Quick.  Come inside.
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.	It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.	But this isn't the jungle!  This is New York.  How did it get here?  A thing like that crossed two continents.  It makes no sense!
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --	We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.	Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
That was D'Agosta.	The planetarium!	Vince!
Is there another way around?	No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
Hide quickly!	What are you going to do?
What is it doing?	It's scared of me.
What happened?	Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.	It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?	I think... it means it's full.	Then it won't go after the others?	No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.	For what?	I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
We have to try and draw it off!	How?	The answer's right in front of us.
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!	It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
Help someone!	Oh God!  Help!
You smell that?	It's coming.  Run.
We're not going to make the storage room!	Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!	What?	That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!
I don't believe it.	You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!	Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
Just like John.  He won't listen.	I have to shoot.	Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the eye.
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.	I can't!	You have to.  Do it now!
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?	I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?	I want to book a flight to Fiji.	Where exactly?	<i>Fiji.</i>	<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?	I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.	Viti Levu.  For how many?	One.	When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?	Today.	I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.	<i>A month.</i>	It's the busy season.	"You are a travel agent, aren't you?  ""Doris""?  Your job is to help people travel."	I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.	Why wouldn't I?	I thought you were in a hurry.	That's right.	You want to book the flight?	It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
Close up?	No, hold back...
Why is he in the basement?	He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.	Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?	What's to see?	What's on the ClockCam?
What happened down there?	He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.	He gave it back to his father.
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.	All prop cars accounted for?	He has to be on foot.  He has the world's most recognizable face.  He can't disappear.
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.	What have we missed?	It's just a matter of time.
We're not watching the sea.	Why would we--	Sweep the harbor.
Cue music...	What music?	<i>Storm</i> music...Wagner...
He doesn't care.	Do it!
Welcome.	Thank you.	The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.	We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--	--a dead one at that.	--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.	Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.	I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?	That and a fat, new contract.	How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?	Amnesia.	Of course.
"Let's talk ratings.  ""Truman"" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?"	As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.	But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?	It has to be the reality.
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.	A window onto the human condition?	I prefer to think of it as a mirror.
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.	But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?	We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?	Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
Are we talking Emmies?	Certainly a nomination.	Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.	As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.	Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with master videographer, Christof.
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.	Let me demonstrate some examples.
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.	Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.	In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.	"Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - ""Bringing Up Baby"" - would turn into a ""cradle to grave"" concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation."	That's correct.	And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.	People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.	No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.	Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--	All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.	There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.	"And it's all available in the ""Truman"" Show"" catalogue.  Operators are standing by."
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?	We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?	I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.	"The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them.  Hollywood, California, you're on ""Tru Talk."""
We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.	"Let's take another call.  London, England, you're on ""Tru Talk."""
Who are you?	I'm the creator.
The creator of what?	A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.	<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?	You're the star.
Nothing was real.	<i>You</i> were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.
I have a map.	Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--	--You never had a camera in my head.
What's he doing?	They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.	The memory of who?	Shhh!
But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?	Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.	I can't believe he married Meryl on the rebound.
How can they have a child?	It's not gonna be his, you idiot.	Why not?	You think she'd go through with it?	Sure she would.	Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
You take Japanese.	Oh, yes.	Lauren, right?	That's right.  Lauren.	I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--	--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.	I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.	You have a boyfriend?  Of course you do.
No...I, er.	No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?	No.	Saturday?
Actually, I'm free Sunday.	Now.	Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.	If we don't go now, it won't happen.
Well, what do you want to do?	I think I've studied enough.
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?	I...I can't.
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.	Yeah?  Outta what?	Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i>
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.	So when are you leaving?	It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...	Nursery?	<i>Spare room</i> - I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird.  I'm going, don't you worry about that.
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.	Yeah, what happened?	"I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the ""Burbank"" name."	You think so?	Trust me.
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?	Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?	I can't tonight.
Marlon--	--Truman, what are you doing here?
I've got to talk to you.	Sorry, I'm way behind.	I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.	Are you okay?  You look like shit.	I think I'm mixed up in something.	<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?	There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?	No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...	I think it's got something to do with my dad.	Your Dad?!	I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.	Who?	It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.	How about them?	Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?	I told you I can't.	I've got to show you something.
What're we doing here, Truman?	This is where it started.	What exactly?	Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?	No.	When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?	I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.	Yeah...	"That's the ""Big Guy"".  Quite a paintbrush he's got."	Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.	Really?
Stay where you are!	Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.	"It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on ""Seahaven Tonight""?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?"	This is different.  Everybody seems to be in on it.
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>	So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?	Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.	What's that?	The thing that started all of this.
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?	Truman, you're gonna be late!
What's that?	It's a surprise.
Well, what do you think?	They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
"Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a ""Chef's-Mate.""  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe."	Gee, that's great.
How did it go today?	A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
I was hoping we could have a special evening.	I won't be late.	Did something happen today?
Where have you been?	I've been thinking--	Oh, God.	--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.	Every time you and Marlon--	--We could bum around the world for a year on that.	And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.	Maybe I feel like a teenager.	We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments.  Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
It'd be an adventure.	I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?	That can wait.  I want to get away.  See some of the world.  Explore.
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.	I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
What're you doing down here?	Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.	I know.	How do you know?	Your mother called.  You shouldn't upset her like that.
What did you want?	I made macaroni.	I'm not hungry.
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?	I still want to look over a couple of things.
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?	Good night, Mother.	See you in a minute, sweetheart.
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.	I'm sorry, I'm late.	What's the hurry?	Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.
Arrah!	Oh, my God!	What do I do?	I don't know--	--you're a nurse, aren't you?	Put some butter on it--or ice?
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me--	I won't be here Sunday.	--we need more charcoal.	Are you listening to a word I'm saying?	You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?
Let's go now.	What?!
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?	You hate gambling.	That's right.  I do, don't I?	So why do you want to go?	Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?	Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?	You blaming me for the traffic?	Should I?
Truman, that was our house!	I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.	Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!	I think I'd like a little company.
It's hard to go places, isn't it?	There's been an accident, Truman.	Uhuh.  There's no accident.  It's just more stalling.
"Truman, I took the ""hypocrite"" oath!"	I bet you did.
Truman, what about that sign?	I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?	I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.	So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea?  I'd better call your mother when we get there.  She'll be worried sick - I don't know how she's going to take this.
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.	Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.	That's not true.
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--	--What the hell are you talking about?!	I've tasted other cocoas.  This is the best.
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!	You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.	You're part of this, aren't you?!
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.	Do something...
Who were you talking to?!	You're the one talking to the walls!	"No.  You said, ""Do something.""  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!"	Truman, stop it!
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?	--Truman, you're gonna be late!
How are you, Mother?	Well, I made it through another night.	How's your hip?	Oh, just so.
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.	I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?	I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?	I feel certain my condition runs in the family.  Can't this wait, dear?
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.	It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.	About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.	They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--	--Darling--	I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?	You know he was an only child, like you.  I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm.  But I don't blame you, Truman.  I never have.
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.	Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.	It looks so small.	Things always do--when you look back.
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.	I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.	Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?	I'll try.	Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.	When you get to Fiji?	You got it.	Fine.  I'll tell her.
Now what?	Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.	Is there any way around?	The whole area's being evacuated.	Well, thank you for your help.	You're welcome, Truman.
They're coming.  Any minute.	Who?	They're going to stop me talking to you.	There's no one here.	Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--	--How do you know about that?	"--And your teacher said, ""You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."""	Were you there--how do you know?	--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.	I don't understand.	You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman.
How's it going, Truman?	Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.	Good.  Good.	Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?	I'd ask for identification.
See you tomorrow, Truman.	You can count on it.
Do you live around here?	Yeah.
Not supposed to talk about it.	You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
I think you better tell us.	We don't even know you.	Well, we're FBI agents.	You're not FBI agents.
Poopy day?	Yup.	A woman?  Work.
What do you do?	"What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. ""Spooky,"" they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time."
I think that about does it, Spooky.	Does what?	Why don't you go home to the old lady --	Sorry. Don't have one.
What am I doing here?	You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.	Penetration but not perforation.
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.	When was that?
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --	You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.	They took her --
I need your clothes, Byers.	Me?
Special Agent Scully --	I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --	Evidence of what?
You've been back to Dallas?	Yes.	Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --	That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --	-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --	Yes. I know.
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --	Nothing completely conclusive --
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --	Working with?	Agent Mulder.
What is it you find incredible?	Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.	No, they don't.	Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
You've got something to show me.	Yes.
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.	Brought on by what?	Heat, I think. The coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six.
This man's still alive.	Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
How can this be?	The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?	No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.	And if it's unsuccessful?	Incinerate it. Like the others.	This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.	Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.	Of what?	They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
Yes.	We have a situation. The members are assembling.	Is it an emergency?
Who called this meeting?	Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.	Into what?
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.	There are complications.
Do they know?	Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.	Who?	Kurtzweil, we think.
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?	You got some kind of business with him?	I'm looking for him.	Looking for him for what?
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?	What's that?	Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
You looking for him for some other reason?	Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?	No. Don't bother.
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.	We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.	Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?	Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.	Have you examined them?	No. Just fossils, far as I know.
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.	Show you right on a map.
How's that?	Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
Do I know you?	No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
You follow me out here for a reason?	Yeah, I did.
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.	I know the name. Why?	Old friend of your father's.
How'd you find me?	Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.	You a reporter?	I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.	Who sent you?	I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.	Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab...
And what's that?	S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.	He just let it explode.	What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?	The Federal Building was too well guarded.	No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
Those people were already dead.	Before the bomb went off?	That's what I'm saying.
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --	Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.	You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?	And one little boy.
I think you're full of shit.	Do you?
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.	Not according to the men in blue.	What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.	They want to discredit you -- for what?	For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.	You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.	You know my work?	Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --	I don't either, but it sure sells books.
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?	How?	I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.	You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?	According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?	It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.	And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?	Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
What was it?	When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.	What killed those men?	What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.	I'll know soon enough.	What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.	A plague?	The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.	Negotiating with whom?	I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.	And they tell me I'm paranoid.	Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
How can I reach you?	You can't.
You found something?	Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.	What?	I'm not sure. A virus --	-- You saw this experiment?	What did it look like?
What do you think?	A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.	That would be my guess.	Your guess?
You told me you had answers.	Yeah, well I don't have them all.	You've been using me --	I've been using you?!	You didn't know my father --	I told you -- he and I were old friends --	You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you?
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.	Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.	And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
Mulder -- it's me --	Where are you, Scully?	I'm on the roof.	Did you find something?	No. I haven't.	What's wrong, Scully?	I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.	You're looking for a bomb.	I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.	I think they have that covered.	Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --
Mulder...?	What happened to playing a hunch?
Jesus, Mulder...	The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.	How's that?	You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.	What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
Now what?	It's locked?
Had you.	No you didn't.	Oh yeah. Had you big time.
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.	Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?	I just did. You're buying.
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?	Something sweet.
Scully...	Scully, I found the bomb.	Where are you, Mulder?	I'm in the vending room.
Scully, get somebody to open this door.	Nice try, Mulder.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.	Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
...thirteen fifty six...	Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there.
Scully?	Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
Something's not right...	-- Mulder! Get in the car!
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.	All I told them was the truth.	They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.	They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.	What? What are you talking about?	I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...	Why?	I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.	They were the ones that put us together.	Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.	This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.	They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.	You're... quitting?	There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
I wake you?	No.	Why not? It's three AM.
Are you drunk, Mulder?	I was until about an hour ago.	Is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
What are you implying, Scully?	I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.	Is that what you'd like me to do?
Go home, Mulder. It's late.	Get dressed, Scully.	Mulder -- what are you doing?	Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?	According to this tag.	And you're looking for?
It's like jelly.	There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous.
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.	You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.	I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.	I'd been told as much.	You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?	I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.	Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.	We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
Why are you whispering?	I can't really talk right now.	What did you find?	Evidence of a massive infection.	What kind of infection?	I don't know.	Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.	Mulder --	I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.	I've got a hearing tomorrow --	-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.	Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
You said you weren't coming?	I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.	What did you find?	Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.	How was it contracted?	That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
He didn't mention a park.	This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.	I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?	The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.	And you've never seen anything like that?	No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
This looks like new grass to you?	It looks pretty green for this climate.
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.	All the equipment is brand new.	No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?	I don't know, Mulder.	And where are they going with it?	That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
What are my choices?	About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.	Where would they be going?	We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
You think they went left?	I don't know why I think they went right.
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?	This is great. This is fitting.
What?	I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.	We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --	-- of what exactly?!	That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.	They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.	Yeah, well they may this one.	What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?	This virus -- it...	Mulder --	It may be extraterrestrial.	I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.	Been where?	Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
What do you think it is?	I have no idea.
This is weird, Mulder.	Very weird.	Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?	Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.	For the purpose of what?
You hear that?	I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.	Maybe. Maybe not.
Scully....?	Yeah...?	Run.
What are you doing?	Come on!
Where'd they go?	I don't know.
What? What's wrong?	Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.	You can't quit, Scully.	I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --	We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --	You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --	After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --	I have. I did. It's done.	Just like that --	I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --	I need you on this, Scully --	You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back.  I've got to go.
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.	You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
What? What happened?	I think... something stung me.
Scully...	Something's wrong...  I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm...
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.	I think you're in anaphylactic shock --	No -- it's --
Scully --	I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
Cold...	Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
We've got to keep moving.	Where are we?	You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
I can't go any farther.	Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
We're going to the morgue.	That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.	On whose orders?	General McAddie's.
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.	I don't know anything about that.	Well, call General McAddie.	I don't have his number.	They can patch you in through the switchboard.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.	Thank you.
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.	About what?	-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.	She was with me.
You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.	And they want to blame us?	Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --	But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.	-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --	-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.	She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.	I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.	Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back.
Agent Mulder --	Where's Scully?!
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.	Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --	I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.	How deep does this go?	I don't know.
Are we being watched?	I'm not taking any chances.
What are you doing?	I've got to find Scully.
Mr. Mulder.	What happened to Kurtzweil?	He's come and gone.
Where's Scully?	I have answers for you.	Is she alive?	Yes.
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.	About the conspiracy?	I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.	I want to know where Scully is.
What is it?	A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.	You're lying.	No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.	A virus?	A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.	This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?	No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.	What do you mean, walked?	Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.	That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --	Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.  Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children,  The only future any of us have.
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.	The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
Why are you telling me this?	I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.	What happened to Kurtzweil?	As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.	Where is he?	Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
Let me out. Stop the car.	Driver.
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.	How?	The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.	What alien environment?	Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.	What about you?	My life is over.  Go.
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.	I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
More concerns than that?	We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
My god...	The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.	This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie!
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.	In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!	Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.	And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.	Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
Our vaccine may have no effect!	Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?	No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.	And Mulder?
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.	You need not kill a man to destroy him.	No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
Sing a song of sixpence...	A pocketful of rye...	Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
Did we go sailing?	Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.	"""Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."""	Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
He hates me.	Lucien Baines?
She adores you.	She thinks I can bring Edward back.	Someday you can.  We all believe that...
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.	Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?	I don't want to find out.
Miriam...	Shush.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.	I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.	It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.	If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.	I do it all the time!	Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...	I'd be there for him.	And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.	Okay, okay...
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?	No.	Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.	Yes mother.	I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
Don't bring it home in this.	Okay.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?	I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.	That's my girl.
Sing a song of sixpence.	A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?	Nothing.	Why did we stop?
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?	Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.	Like a New Year's Day hangover.	He needs to be turned over.
This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so.	I'll be fine.	She said convincingly.
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...	No.  No.
Is it cold in here?	What happened?
...a pocketful of rye.	Four and twenty blackbirds...	Baked in a pie.
Damn him.	What's wrong?	Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...	I don't need them anymore...	I know.
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.	Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...	...give a kiss to Edward.	Give a kiss to Edward.
"What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was ""normal?""  Conscious.  How far would you go?"	As far as I needed.
There's always a chance they'll confess.	Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?	Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...	Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
"I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some ""troubled kid"" you're dealing with."	I realize that...	How hard could it be...?
This man is deeply disturbed, he...	You don't know the procedure.	I know him.
Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.	Do you think that's funny?	"No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I""m here, isn't that right?"
I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...	It doesn't have much to do with science.	What then?	The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.	Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
Agent Novak?	Peter, okay?	Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.	Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.	That's what therapists are for, right?
With Stargher I saw things...	What did you see?	A kingdom.  His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear.  A horrible primitive ugly thing.  I don't want to talk in here.
Why'd you bring him here?	You're the shrink, you tell me.	As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me.
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.	I did, yeah.	You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
What about Julia?	This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.	You think you can do this, don't you?	He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.	This is Stargher we're talking about?	Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.	Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?	Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.	"It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like ""remorse."""	Then what is he?	Evil.	If you believe that.	Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.	What happened to Charles Gish?
What happened?	What difference does it make...?	Tell me.
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.	You're sure of that?	Yes.  I am.
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.	Okay, okay...
Wait...	"Like hell ""wait."""
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...	Little boy?!  That's him!	He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him.
Where the hell are we?	Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
COME ON!	I can't leave him!
That went well.	Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
You sure about this?	Absolutely.  Abigail...
I heard Julia and John got married.	Yep.  Eloped.	Good for them.
Well look at that.	I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...	So you say.
He's mine?	All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.	It doesn't matter...	I don't know.  I think it does.  You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it.  What happened to Stargher.  That last time.
They're hungry.	I got it.
Thank you.	No problem.	No.  Thank you.
You liked him?	He's beautiful...
What now?	's broken.
Who says?	Mocky-Lock.	Oh no... No you don't.	"""Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."""	I bet we can fix it.
She the one from Santa Cruz?	Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
Agent Cole.	I need you to find something in the basement...	Already there.	That hoist, with the winch...
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.	Delano?	Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?	You're kidding me.	I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?	They took care of that, thank you, Henry.
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.	"Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as ""receivers.""  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared."
Intravenous administration complete.	Initiating connection.
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.	Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.	I think that's the whole point.
She changed the codes.	What's wrong?	It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't.
Instead of going into his mind...	She's bringing Stargher into hers.
When did he lapse into the coma?	Sometime yesterday morning.
What about the legalities of this...?	Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights.
Catherine!	I'll get her...
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.	"That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's ""lost.""  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy."
Into Stargher.  Inside...	Yes.
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.	No.
Nervous?	Absolutely.
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?	Prevacid.  For my stomach.	Any psychiatric medication?	No.	What about narcotics?	No.	I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.	I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.	I doubt that.
Is she alright?	Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Agent Novak.	Dr. Kent.	You're looking well.	Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.	That's a secret.	Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all...
How's the patient.	Awaiting his arrival.	What about the cat?	Completely unaware.
Someone looking after her little girl?	Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
So?	Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
I need it.	Now?	Now.
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.	Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.	It's his dog.
How is she?	Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
Here he is.	Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.	Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?	"She remembers because it was her ""dream truck.""  Wanted one just like it."
We proceed assuming she is.	Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.	No.  Can you get a man close?
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.	They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
You sure you want to go through with this?	What else do we do?!	I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?	I don't have to.	Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.	"Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say ""It was all his idea."""	That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die.
Right here.	Next time, tell me, okay?	But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.	Considering where I've been...
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?	I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.	You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.
Ich weiss nicht.	Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande...
Den leuten.	Ja, ja, ja.	Sayen sie ed our den Leuten damit sie es auch wissen.
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...	Give her some cigarettes.	Das worren nooh zeiten.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.	They think you did it.
Thank you.	Sit down.	Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
You were awfully good.	Do you understand German?	No, no...oh...excuse me.
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.	No, he never told me about his friends. Would you like some tea?
Well, I saw you at the funeral.	I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.	You were in love with him, weren't you?	I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.	I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
No.	He has a little dog.	Oh, yes, yes.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.	That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.	Dr. Winkel told me that.	Dr. Winkel? Who is he?	The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.	His own doctor?	Yes.	Were you at the inquest?
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.	He was Harry's driver?	Mmmm.
...at all.	I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
I don't know. They didn't answer.	I was told there were only two men there.
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.	Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?	Why don't you leave this town - go home?
What's she talking about?	The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
Anything really wrong with your papers?	They're forged.	Why?	The Russians would claim me. I come from Czechoslovakia.
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?	Dr. Winkel.
Drink?	Whiskey.
Harry?	Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Who are you looking for now?	Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.	Silly looking bunch.
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.	Need we go through it all again?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?	Just another part I've got to learn.
Can I hear you?	In German?	I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?	Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
Do I...	Well you read this.
Gestern bein heurigen...	What's that?	"""Ein hurigan"" - I guess."
H-E-Z-T...	Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
Tell me about him.	Tell you what?
When...what did you do?	Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
...to steal my girl.	Where is she?
Oh, that was many years ago.	Tell me more.	Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
...and buried him.	Anna.
Seemed like a good idea.	It's just what he used to say.	Well, I didn't learn that from him.	If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.	What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?	I thought you wanted...	A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.	We're both in it, Harry.	Holly.	I'm so sorry.	It's all right.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?	Yes.
Let's go away.	What's the matter?	Let's not get into any more trouble.	Wait here.
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.	What are you going to do?	I wish I knew.	Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Wer ist da?	Me.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?	I don't know.
I'm going back home.	Why?
What happened to your hand?	A parrot...Let it go.	Have you seen Calloway?	Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?	Have you?
...you know.	He told you, didn't he?
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.	I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.	He liked to laugh.	Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.	I'll put these flowers in water.
...and my lover. He was Harry.	Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
...again.	There isn't enough for two laughs.
Are you going, too?	Oh...
...is there?	How did you know I would be here?
...Headquarters.	Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
Harry.	I'm sorry.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?	Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
Here, it will be cold on that train.	I shall be all right.	You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?	He's safe in the Russian zone.	How do you know?	I saw him today.
Did he say anything about me - tell me?	Oh, the usual things...	There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
Of course I didn't tell Calloway.	Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
That's his headache.	His.	Oh, well.	Why are you lying?	We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
...quarrel?	If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
...anyway?	From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?	Of course.	I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins...
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?	Thank you.	Keep the packet.
Nichts danke. Kein.	Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
...parents.	Yes.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.	They're Harry's.	That's the reason.	You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.	They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.	There's nothing in them.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.	And my passport?
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?	We loved each other, do you mean that?
Do you know this man?	I have never seen him.
Joseph Harbin...	No.	He works in a military hospital.	No.	It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt. I'm in a position to help you.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.	It wasn't important.
You can help us.	What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?	Two weeks ago.
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.	It's true then?
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.	What did you say? I'm sorry...
I said another man was buried in his place.	Where's Harry?	That's what we want to find out.	I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.	Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.	I don't know.	If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.	Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
Must you take those?	They'll be returned, miss.	They are - private - letters.	That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.	I don't want it.	Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.	I don't...
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.	Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.	Good-bye.
Yes.	I was a friend of Harry Lime.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.	Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?	Where?	Just around the corner.	How will I know you?	I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
What is it?	This is forgery. It is very clever.
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?	No, not yet.
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?	Yes, of course.	Thank you.
...Austrian Police Headquarters.	Can I have that woman's passport?
Can you tell me whose...	Fellow called Lime.
My name is Calloway.	Martins.	You a friend of Lime's?	Yes.	Been here long?	No.
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.	Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.	Schmolka!
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.	When did you see him last?	September '39.
See much of him before that?	Once in a while.
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?	Holly Martins.	No, sorry.
"Did you ever hear of ""The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"""	I can't say that I have.	"""Death at the Double X Ranch"" - Ra- a-nch."	No.
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.	What?	Him dying like that.	Best thing that ever happened...
...to him.	What are you trying to say?	He was...
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.	Ever seen one?	Pin it on a...
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.	It wasn't petrol.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?	Well, you could say that murder was part...
Listen, Callaghan.	Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
...expense.	Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
What the devil?	Getting around, Martins.	Oh, pinning things on girls now.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.	I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?	Calloway.
Miss Schmidt.	You're not locking her up?
Get the next plane.	As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.	Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.	Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?	A bruised lip.
A parrot bit me.	Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.	I'm only a little fool - I'm an amateur at it - you're a professional. You've been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
Well?	In Vienna...
Do you see what that means?	Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.	Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
Next, Paine.	I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
So would I.	Bring him in.	I can't. He disappeared...
...a week ago.	It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
...be responsible for you in the streets.	I'm not asking you to.
...in the morning.	Thank you. Excuse me.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...	Well?...	This is where he vanished.	I see.	I suppose you don't believe me.	No.	Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?	Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?	Fifty yards right down there.	Which side of the road?	I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.	How about the doorway?	I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.	Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
It wouldn't work.	We'll never get him in the Russian zone.	Calloway, you expect too much. I know he deserves to hang, you proved your stuff. But twenty years is a long time - don't ask me to tie the rope.
Calloway!	Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
A girl of spirit.	She's right. It's none of my business.
Didn't I?	You all did.
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...	Of course.	Why don't you come in, too - you're a writer... Might interest you.
"Paine lent me one of your books; ""Oklahoma Kid,"" I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?"	All right, Calloway. You win.	I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...	I said you win.	Win what?	I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
What time is it?	Two thirty.
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?	I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
Wait a minute - let me out.	Well, there's not much time.	One can't just leave - please.
Be sensible, Martins.	I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?	Take him to Sacher's.
It's a military hotel.	I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books.
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.	This way, miss.
Very good, sir.	You know, Paine's one of your devoted readers. He's promised...
"...of Santa Fe."""	I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
Shall I go over there, sir?	No, no. Leave them for a while.
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.	Oh, Mr. Martins...
...excuse me.	Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.	Do you know his number?	No, I don't know...
...his number.	I'll look it up for you.	Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
You do!	"Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did ""Hamlet"" and the week before we had something..."
Welcome?	I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
They wouldn't know me.	Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
How long can one stay here on this stage money?	Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
Come upstairs a moment.	I know a very good dentist.	I don't need a dentist. Somebody hit me, that's all.
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.	No, a major, were you really?	Heard of Harry Lime?	I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.	Goodness, that's awkward.	"Is that what you say to people after death? ""Goodness that's awkward..."""
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?	Certainly.
Seems exciting.	It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.	Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.	What about?	On the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the Crisis of Faith.
What's that?	Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.	Of course, of course, of course.
Zane Grey.	Oh, that is Mr. Martins' little joke, of course...
Mr. Crabbin.	What is it, Sergeant?	Mr. Holly Martins, sir.	Who?	The author. Thought you might be interested.	Never heard of him.	Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.	Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
Striptease, sir.	Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
Very popular, sir.	Very popular. Are you staying long?
...leaving tomorrow, sir.	Excuse me, have you got tooth...
Hello, Harry.	Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.	Listen...	Yes.	I want to talk to you.	Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...	It's good to see you, Holly.
Hmm.	She's been arrested.	Tough...tough...Don't worry, old man, they won't hurt her.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?	You can help her.	Holly...
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?	I told the police.
Unwise, Holly...	And - Anna...	Did the police believe you?	You don't care anything at all about Anna, do you?
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.	You wouldn't do anything.
What do you want me to do?	You can get somebody else...	Do you expect me to give myself up?	Why not?	It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...	You've got plenty of contacts.	Outside of your stories...I've got to be careful.
I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...	As long as they can use you?	I wish I could get rid of this thing.
You told them, didn't you?	Don't try to be a policeman, old man.	What did you expect me to be - part of your...
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.	I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...	Sure...
Have you ever seen any of your victims?	Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
...this way.	What do you want?
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?	Coffee.	Zwei zwartze.
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.	Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
You really liked it?	At the end of every chapter --
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.	Here?
...were of you.	What did he say?
...you know and all that.	But he said he died instantaneously.
Well, there was only you, and this friend of his. Who is he?	A Roumanian.
...you.	Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.	What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?	Will you give me...
...your address?	I live in the Russian sector, but you'll find me at the Casanova Club every night. One has to work...
...the best way one can, you know.	What's the name of this girl?
Not yet.	But you will.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.	The Roumanian?	Yes. The man who helped carry him.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.	How do you do.
Are you mad?	All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Dr. Winkel?	Vinkel.	Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.	Yes.
Martins.	Coming to the point, please.	Thank you.	I have guests waiting.
Find out?	Hear the details.	I can tell you very little. He was run over by a car. He was dead when I arrived.
Could he have been at all conscious?	I understand...
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.	In great pain?	Not necessarily.
Speak English?	English?
Already gone.	Who?
Coffin?	Mr. Lime's.  Accident...
Baron Kurtz.	Must be some mistake.
Excuse me!	Yes, sir.
Did you know Mr. Lime well?	Mr. Lime - yes.	You remember me? Upstairs...	Yes, yes, I remember you.
...Popescu...	und ich kann nicht alle kennen.	What does he say?
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.	What's he saying?
Happened...Yes happened right down there.	You saw it?	Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.	Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Could he have been conscious?	Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?	Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?	Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.	I was told that he did not die at once.	Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
...give evidence.	Who else?
Kurtz.	Yes.	The Roumanian?	Yes.	And?
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.	You don't mean that doctor?	No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue.
You gotta tell your story to the police.	Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.	You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.	Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.	Suppose I take...
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.	Now, hold on.	Das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern...
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.	Well make it your business.
Yes, it is.	I am not a bad man.
Oh, you did.	Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
Harry...	Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.	Funny?	Something wrong.	Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
That's all you meant?	What else?
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?	He didn't want to get involved.	Will we never teach these Austrians to be good citizens. It was his duty to give the evidence.
What else did he tell you?	That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.	Not necessarily.
No.	Joseph Harbin.	Joseph Harbin? No...no.
Third Man.	A novel, Mr. Martins?
Mr. Martins...	Not when I get interested.
...this time.	Yes.
Should I make it all fact?	Why no, Mr. Martins.
...Mr. Martins?	Never.
Passport, please.	Oh.
What's the purpose of your visit here?	A friend of mine offered me a job here.	Where are you staying?	With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.	His name?
Lime.  Harry Lime.	Okay.	I thought he'd be here to meet me.
Excuse me.	Yes?	I'm Daffy.	Richard. Hi.	Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.	Help you out?	Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.	I'm sorry, I don't think so.	I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.	I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.	Just five dollars, please.
I'll share something with you.	I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -	Here.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.	Just take it, OK.
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.	Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.	Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?	Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -	Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.	Thanks.
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?	Traveler.	You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.	I don't think so.	Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.	I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
Bonjour.	Good morning.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.	She means your neighbor. The Scotsman	Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.	We moved rooms because of him.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.	Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.	Nice work.	There is one problem.
He will not take us to the island. It's in the National Park and it is forbidden to go there. But we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.	That's the wrong one.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?	One or two kilometers.	Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?	Why?	"We're going to swim ""one or two kilometers"" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?"
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.	Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
I don't know - I'm American.	So?	We think in miles, not kilometers.	So how many miles do you think it is?	I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
Everyone ok?	We're ok.	I think we're about half way.
Richard - I saw a fin!	What!	A fin!
A shark fin?	I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.	Big?	Yes.	Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.	Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.	Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.	I'm sorry.	A bit fucking late.
She is gone!	What happened?
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.	Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
What about Moliere?	Fuck off.
He tried to borrow money from us.	What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.	He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.	It's on an island that no one get to.	But he has been there, off course.	It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.	You can swim?
One kilometer	Two.	Richard?
Bonsoir.	Eh - bonsoir.
Did you sleep well?	Not too bad.	I hope our noise did not keep you awake.
Hi.	Hi there. Here, take a look.
So from there to there?	We swim.	Swim?
Have you told someone?	No.	I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
Francoise -	Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.
I think so too.	One night I will get the perfect photograph.
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.	Incredible.	There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.	So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.	Exactly.	Richard, you know something -
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.	Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.	It's just the sky, Richard.
Too far?	If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we dont try then we'll never know.
We lost our key.	Where did you lose it?
"Do you know the Kentucky friend mouse story?"""	Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.	Exactly. Always happened to someone else.	So?	So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.	Uh-huh.
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?	We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
You think?! Based on what?	There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.	No one follows that midrash.	I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
Watch your language....	I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.	Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
They only kill them when they love them?	What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
What's a fascist?	I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.	Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.	The Zionists aren't Nazis.	They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....	They don't have extermination camps.	They had Sabra and Shattila.
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.	They sound like you.	The Nazis did everything the führer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....	Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?	She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....
Fucking Danny, man...	He's an asshole.
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?	What??	That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.	That's a movie, you moron.	Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters.
What do you think you're doing?	Who the fuck are you?	Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint.  Give it to me.
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.	Then I won't bring you....
What, do you like it here?	Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
You coming?	We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
Do we have to listen to this shit?	Yes.	Why'd we have to leave so fast?
Oh, please...	Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?	Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --	Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz.
What do you care?	I don't, but...	Let's look at the fucking thing.
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.	Fire...	The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings.
How come you know all this shit?	How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --	Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.	No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
Yeah, but not on the letters.	Why the fuck not?	Just don't.
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.	I have a job.	This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.	You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.	Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.	Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --	Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong.
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.	People still need values, beliefs....	No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.	I don't care about money.	You will.	You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.	Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?	Nobody reads that stuff anymore.	Too difficult?	Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?	The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.	Disease? What disease?	Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
Which is what?	At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
You're not in school? What do you do?	I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.	Where'd you read all that stuff?	I just read it....
Why no silencer?	You want it to be an event.
"""...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."""	"""And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."""	How come so many of the books are in Spanish?	They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.	Are they still together?	He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.	Is he a Nazi?	I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.	What's he care about?	Killing himself.
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?	That's stupid. Why would they?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.	Yes, I am. Basically I am.
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.	You weren't complaining about my play last time.
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.	Oh, really?	Bigger and better.	Then how come you're talking to me?
Who's Linda?	Why won't you talk to me?	I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
When can I see you?	You can't.
Your father??	He's at a home out here.
I'm coming to your room tonight.	No.
Where'd you get this?	I stole it. From a synagogue.
How come there's no punctuation?	That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.	Do you know it like that? By heart.	No.	But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?	What do you care?	'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way.	Oh, yeah...	Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...	What's it mean?	And God said to Avram, take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your father's house into the land -- a different land -- and I will show you....
I want to learn to read it.	Why?	Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?	Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.	I'm good at languages.
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.	Why not?	They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....	That's stupid.	Yeah, it's stupid.  Put it on, or I won't teach you.
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.	What assholes.	You can't curse in front of it either.
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?	Good question. Both.  Aleph...	It looks a little like a swastika.	It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.	Where are they?	They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...	The sex is better.	Even though his dick is so big?	With you there's a tragic dimension.	Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...	V'asitem...	V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?	No difference.	Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.	Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.	What's it about?	About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....	And belief follows?	No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.	Fuck that.	Don't curse in front of it.	Why should I submit?	You shouldn't.	You think I should just because there's no reason?
No, I think you shouldn't.	Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.	I told you, I'm good at this.	Plus you have nothing else to do all day.	Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?	It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
Nazis talk about it all the time.	Do they?
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...	Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?	Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?	'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.	You want a punch in the mouth?	Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.	Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.	I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?	Lina, come here!
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.	Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?	I don't know. I just want to try it.	Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?	No. What are you looking for?	Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.	He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.	And be crushed.	Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.	You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...	You gotta get out of here.	You don't own this place.
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]	Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?	I didn't realize you cared.	I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.	Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?	Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.	I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?	I doubt it. How did you find out?	He called me up. He wanted to talk to me about my ideas.
That's a much easier game.	Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
I thought there were people here....	I'll go look....
Who's Eichmann?	Who's Eichmann?!!?
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.	What'd you say?	Nothing. Let's go....
Why are you taking that?	I'm stealing it.
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...	Did you see how they reacted to him?	Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.	It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.	Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely lasted a decade.... Do you really want to go down that road again? In America of all places, where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues...
An investment banking house.	He's Jewish? Manzetti?
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.	We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
More cultural than political.	Obviously.	Decentralized, nonviolent, increasingly mainstream. We'll see antiabortion, anti-immigration groups form alliances with the gun lobby, Christian identity types, tax resisters and even some libertarians....
That would be a catastrophic mistake.	People hate Jews. Do you agree?	They used to. Today it's not an issue.	"No, but deep down, beneath the ""tolerance"" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl.  It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it."
You wouldn't announce it?	I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.	But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.	Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.	How would you kill him?	I'd have to research it, study his routines, his security.... But ideally on a New York street at midday, using a small-caliber automatic without a silencer.
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?	They're liars and cowards.	I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?	It's the truth....
Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.	What about Mrs. Moebius and...?	They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?	A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.	What's that?  Okay. Surprise us...
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....	I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....	That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?	I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to --
Is it okay if I record this?	No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?	I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.	What about Curtis Zampf?	Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.	I agree.	The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?	In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?	It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?	What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?	My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.	German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...	Danny, what about the Jews?
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....	A poison...?	Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.	Sexuality??? What do you mean?	You ever fuck a Jewish girl?	What??!?	Did you ever fuck one, Guy?	What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?	And? WHat did you notice?	Notice? Like what...?	Jewish girls like to give head, right?	I don't know. Is that right?	And Jewish men like to get it.	Everybody likes to, don't they?	Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?	Why?	Because the Jew is essentially female.	Female...	Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.	Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?	You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.	Danny, what makes you think you know all this?	Let's just say I've done due diligence.	So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.	The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society.
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.	He has Israel.	Those aren't Jews.	Of course they're Jews.	"Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he ""universalizes"" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end..."	Are all Jews the same?	Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews.
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?	Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?	Who? How would I know him?	He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.	You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?	So you're saying it's not true.	Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?	Do you know who you're fucking with here?	That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?	Listen to me....	Why would Nadelman lie?	To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?	Give me a reason not to.	It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.	Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
"But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this ""destruction"" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?"	Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?	No.
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.	What were you, following me?	How do you reconcile the two?	I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.	Explain it so I can.	You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.	I don't think you know what you are.	Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?	Who killed Manzetti?	If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?	It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?	Get the fuck away from me.
I always won.	The arguments, anyway.
Why did you come tonight? To see me?	To hear them read Torah.	I thought you hated Torah.	That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.	Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.	I can't help what I think.	This is me.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.	How did you...?	I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.	You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?	Which <i>Times</i> guy?	With the shoes... There was more than one?
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?	A forty-five.	It was a nine millimeter.	You're lying.	So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?	I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....	But I wasn't.	And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.	I can't say that.	Think about your father. Your sister.	The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?	Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.	Fucking kike.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?	There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
How did you get the fucking number?	I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....	I don't do that.	You do it on the inside....	Don't tell me what I --	...I want you to do it on the outside, too.	No!	Yes!
Lina Moebius. And you are...?	Daniel Balint.	Balint?	It's German.	What part of Germany are you people from?	From the Rhineland originally.	Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?	I was going to ask you the same thing.
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.	Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.	We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?	So what Jew would you kill first?	Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.
Do you feel you're making progress here?	You mean Ilio Manzetti?	Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish.  Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.
How have things been going?	Fine.	We want to talk to you about something....  We're about to launch an aboveground, intellectually serious fascist movement.
Hello...?	Lina... It's happening. Tonight.	What is happening?	Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.	Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?	Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
What about chicken?	That's meat.	The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk.	Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.	But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.	No, I don't admit it's stupid.	You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?	I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --	But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?	Steve...	Steve's going to explain it.
What are you doing here?	I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.	Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.	Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...	They're not my people....	Tell it to Hitler.	Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...	Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?	What kids?...	The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?	Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.	Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --	I've got to get back to the --	You can heat them up and eat with him.
Hello...?	Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.	<i>New York Times</i>...?
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....	Who told you that?	Isn't it true?	No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
Who knows what that is?	A Jewish prayer.	Can anybody imagine why I would say a Jewish prayer?
Which was his room?	Number ten.
Where's Mrs. Moebius?	Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes.
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.	You could do it.	Get out of here....	You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
Which one were you aiming at?	The mother.
What is it?	Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
Shut up. Fuck you....	What...?
Open it up.	Here...
This will be a different kind of device.	That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?	I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.	I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.	It will.
What about Drake, did he ever show up?	No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went.
That's all we've got left.	It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
Didn't you get anything?	I'm not hungry.... Come on, let's drive around.... We don't want to be spotted here.
Oh, what is this shit?	Keep driving. Don't slow down.	Christ...
Not too fast.	You said they didn't have night guards.	They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.	Who even knew?	Mrs. Moebius.	Why? Why would she?	The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.	So what do we do with the device?
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.	Where?	I have an idea....
If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to...	No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.	It's not going to be fine. It's --	Just do it.
When do you want it to go off?	Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.	So that's what? Nineteen thirty minutes...what time is it now...
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.	Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?	I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...	JTS...?	What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.	I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.	Are you an artist?	No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
You remember Miriam....	Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.	Wow, that's uh...great...
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --	Shut up...
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.	Get out of my way.
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.	Why me?	You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
Who'd you kill?	Four. But no one this important.
How did you know they were Jews?	I can tell....	How?	I was a Jew in a previous life.
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.	I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --	Just get him in the cross-hairs. With those shells, anywhere you hit him, it'll bounce around, rip his insides all up.
You missed on purpose.	I didn't. I told you, I can't --	What's that?
And what did you do?	What are you trying to say?	What did you do while the sergeant was killing your son?
You can't say that....	The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...	Okay, that's it. You're going back to --	What do you think you should have done?
Where do you think you're going?	...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
It's Friday....	Do I give a shit?
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?	"""Do chickens give milk?"""	Exactly.
Who's this?	Dennis Leary.	Leary?	No.
Howard Stern.	Obviously.
Adam Sandler.	Funny?	Not like Mr. Dorfmann.	He was funny.
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.	And that's when the Mets started to stink.	'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...	Valentine...
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.	Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.	Just a little... What's the difference?
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.	Fund-raising??	We think you'd be good at it.
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...	Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?	Beth Shalom? It's Reform.	So what?	They're not that Jewish.	I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
We tested the new bomb.	What?	We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.	Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
Are you out of your mind?!	I was just trying to make a point. If --
Do you think I...	Danny, please, we don't want to know.
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....	Eat shit....	...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....	EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....	And let us say...
Oh, fuck you...	As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....	None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.	What do you mean?	I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?	Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?	The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?	Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.	And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
You're going to live here permanently?	... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
He's shy, not like Enzo.	Yes.  Not like Enzo.	I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.	... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
Are you going to keep it?	Yes.	Does he know?	No.	Maybe you should talk to him about it.	I can't... I just don't know how to...
"I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan ""You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee""?"	But your man isn't quite a God!	Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.	Well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?	Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
You're leaving?	Yes...  Could you please give this to Enzo.	Of course.
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.	I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
Did you tell him?	Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.	... You take care of yourself, Johana.
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.	What kind?	Johana, am I boring you?	Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?	I said that the file is incomplete.
Did the driver really freeze?	Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.	My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.	... So am I.
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!	What d'you mean?	The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!
What's happened??	The documents are forged.	No!	Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!	It can't be true!	We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.	I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...	I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.	I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?	Italian is practically the same thing.
Good afternoon.	I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.	Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.	Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?	You're right.  You're fired.	Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.	The Italian, I presume?	No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.	He seems to have won it.	Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
I tell you she's mine!	Hello!	You know each other?	Yes.	Enzo Molinari.
This is a great pleasure.	Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?	It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.	I think I'll have a coffee.
Where did you two meet?	In a lake.	I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.	Congratulations.	Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world.  One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti?	No.	I'll take you there.  We'll live in the sun.  You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees.
You forgot the Hula!	Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!	You'll be lovely, but no thanks.  Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.	Have you known him long?	Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.	What was he like, when he was little?	Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.	I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.	Exactly!  What is it Johana?  You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?!
And just where are you from?	Italy!
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?	No.	"He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  ""I'm going to beat you""."	... That's what he's here for, isn't he?	"Listen to her!  ""That's what he's here for""!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?"
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?	Okay.
... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?	Congratulations, Enzo.	Don't you agree, Jacques?
And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.	Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
Well, good night, then...	You going to sleep here, all by yourself?	Yes...
... It's a comfortable place.	Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.	The Mamma's there too.	Yes, the Mamma is is there.	Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
Is it a poem?	"No, it's the recipe for spaghetti ""Frutti del mare"".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!"
Jacques!  Johana!	Enzo!
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.	What are you doing here?	Checking out the competition.	Enzo, why do you guys do this?	What else is there?	You know what I'm talking about.
You risk your life when you cross the street.	Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!	Because you'd laugh.	I won't, I swear.	I dive in search of God.  If I go deep enough I'm going to find him.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?	No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.	He can learn.  He is learning.	You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?	How do you know that?	You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
... Not yet.	Don't.	Why?	Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?	Five minutes and fifty seconds.	That idiot!
Is he alright?  What happened?	The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
How did it happen?	The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?	How many are, down there?
Ten thousand.	Lira?	Dollars.	You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.	What does that mean?
Roberto?  How long?	Six seconds.
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?	Have the car painted.	Santini will do that for 25 dollars!	Then tell him to wax it too.	Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?	A rosary for Mama, a dress for
Yes?	Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
What about the shoes?	Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
Enzo, wake up!	Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
The medics are looking all over for you.	I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
Where did you get that?	"""That""!  This is not a ""that""..."
Is he here?	He's training.
Plenty of women everywhere right?	Smoking is absolutely forbidden.	It isn't lit yet.	You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!	"Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying ""it"" on board?!"	The rules are the rules.	... What's your name again?	Noireuter.	And where did you say you were from?	I didn't say...  Brussels!
What's with the voice?	It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.	And... does the voice come back?	For others, yes... For you, who knows?	Try speaking to me?
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.	Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?	Fine!
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?	No...	If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?
Jacques, my friend, how are you?	Enzo...
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?	Yes, I know.	I dove 315 feet!	Great!	They say I'm like Lazarus.  You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
Why?	Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.	I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?	No.  All you need is to want to be the best.	You're the best, Enzo!	"That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  ""D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete."" So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there..."
I remember.  Hi Roberto!	What room have you got?	I don't have one.	You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!	It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.	Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!	Enzo drop it, I'll find something.
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?	Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
Well, what are they?	I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
That's good.	How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?	It's okay.	... You married?
No.	Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?	Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!	Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.	People say that?	Forget it.  I was joking.
No, no!	Not at all!	You're staying at the hotel?
Enzo?	What?	Your mother?	Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
Madame...	... And his friend, Johana...
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.	I'm a little tired, I don't know if...	Get in the car!
No.	Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
Why?	... For the mermaids.
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.	Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.	Why?  Are they what's most important?	No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?	... Everything.	Everything about what?	Well... about everything.
Why?	If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
Two years younger than you.	As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.	The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!	Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath?
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?	"Because pasta should be eaten ""Al Dente"".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit."
No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.	... I'm listening.
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?	Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
Good night.	You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?	What?	The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
Here...  Here...	What is it?	Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it!  Look here!
You still collect them?	Yes.	You don't have that one, do you?	No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.	"Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told Roberto ""He's very good that little Frenchman, very good"".  I lost my title but I won a watch!"
Can I come in?	No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
He doesn't like us.	So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!	I don't want to erase anything.	You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?	... Yes.	I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.	Thank you.
Anybody can have a bad day!	I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.	It's never the sea!  It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit!  Jacques, what do you know?
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!	Thank you, thank you very much!
That's good.	Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
... How long was I asleep?	Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
I'm concentrating.	We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.	You say that because you have the title!	No!  I would never cheat you.	Well that's very nice of you.
You were right.	... I was right about what?	... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
... Push me back in the water...	I can't.	Jacques, take me back down... Please.
Don't you have a heater?	Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?	Does anybody live to make a second?
A drink to warm up?	Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.	Tea... or whiskey?	... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?	Who?	The guy in the Halloween suit!
I recognize you.	We saw each other a little while ago.	In the lake?	No... in the hut.
Please, have a seat.	Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
But what brought you to Sicily?	I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.	... Okay.  I'll try.
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!	I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?	I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?	I don't know... why?	Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?	I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?	Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
I thought you'd be at the dinner.	It's too loud for me.
You look adorable.	Thank you...	... Especially the sneakers.
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.	Lucky I was there to save you.	You jumped in?	Only to help the medics, I assure you.	My wallet.
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?	Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...	Give it to me.
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...	I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.	I'd better get back now.	You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
... No?	No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
How can you tell it's a female?	... The way she moves.
She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.	How do you know that?	I don't know, I just feel it.
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?	Uh... Yes, of course!
Jacques, you set a world record.	I did?	Aren't you happy?  Don't you feel proud...?  I feel proud and all I did was watch.
I'm going back home.	Why?	Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.	I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.	Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.	But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
Hello?	It's me... Johana.
How are you?	I got fired.	... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too.
So have I.  ... Hello?	I'm still here.	Well, then, talk to me some more.	... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.	Then, tell me a story.	Uh... Ah!  A story?
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?	No... tell me.	You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
Hello?	It's me again.
I'm being a pain, huh?	... Not at all.	You sure?	Absolutely positive.	Okay.  In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.	You'll understand.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis.	Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?	I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
And you?	I didn't dive.	You'll try again tomorrow?	I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
What?	... Nothing.
What are you doing?	I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
Jacques...?	You go back, I'll walk.
What's wrong?	It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.	You want to lie down for a while?	No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?	... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.	Why?	Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
You've got to tell me what happened?	I saw how it has to be.
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.	That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.	You are the father.
Promise me one thing.	Anything.	Promise you won't forget me.
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.	... Are you sure?	Positive, Sir.
This is the hotel San Domenico?	Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.	Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?	No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.	Ah?!
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.	Then you shouldn't eat everyday, Jacques.
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?	No.
Why don't you ask me?	What?	Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
Assassin!	Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.	Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?	I brought Johana to meet you.	Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.	No, no.  Johana is visiting me.
Where are you from, Henrietta?	Johana... New York.	What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?	He doesn't hear too well.
Uncle Louis!	No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand?
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?	Well... here.	In my apartment?	It's my apartment.	Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.	Uncle Louis, we have a guest!	I'm going to put a lock on the telephone.  Did you bring the cassettes?
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?	The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?	Louis, we were French!	That's different!  What's the matter with you?
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!	... Sally?
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.	Again?	They got the new T.V.
... And the new stereo.	I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?	Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?	You called the police?	They're going to send detectives.
Well?	What?	How was your trip?	Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.	Okay... Who'd you meet?
It's his heartbeat.	Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?	Haven't you been listening?
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.	Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?	Way past it.	Does that have a hidden meaning?	No.  I'm just depressed.	You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...	I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.	What is it honey... the frenchy?	Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.	Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
What are they for?	They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.	If there was a problem, they could do something right?	Of course, that's what they're for.
... And those?	Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.	What's that little air bottle on the machine?	That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.	But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?	Yes... It's magic.
Who... Who is that?	Mayol... Jacques Mayol.	That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.	I'll have to talk to the driver.	In the spring when he melts!
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.	But... how is he going to breathe?	He isn't going to breathe.
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.	How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?	It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.	Why is he doing this?	For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?	Coffee might be nice.
Will he understand Spanish?	His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?	Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?	You've made me a happy insurance person.	Then, goodbye.
Wait!  Professor...?	... Yes?
I'll go see how he's doing.	Let him sleep.
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.	I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.	A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?	Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.	What's your first move?	I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.	You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?	That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.	Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.	Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.	One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.	What's up?	About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.	Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.	No way, it's too dangerous. Besides, my days of hooking are over.
So why the long face?	It's Esther. Santa's got her.	My Esther! Oh Mordechai.
Please. Will you help me?	I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
There won't be any need for that sir.	Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.	I know sir. I won't let you down.
So. Do you have a name?	It's Esther.	From the story of Purim.  Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath.
You like my Mordechai, yes?	He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.	What do you want me to do?	He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there.
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.	Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?	Please, call me Mordechai.	From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...	Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
Client notes. Sorry.  What can I do for you?	My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.	How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?	Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.	Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.	I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days...
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.	I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
Any sign of Santa?	He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.	C'mon follow me.
That got annoying fairly quickly.	Yeah, no kidding.
So, now what?	Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
Want to get a drink?	Sure. Why not.
What was that!?	I said, do you come here often!?
What!?	I said, yeah, about once a week!	Oh!
Sorry. I'm better with men.	Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.	You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it.
Mordechai?	Yes Esther.	I want you to talk dirty to me.	Oh. Okay.
I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.	Keep going.	Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism.
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.	Kiss me you Semitic stud!
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.	Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?	Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.	No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
We do!	I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
What are you doing here?	Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.	I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.	I forgive you.
Esther!	Mordechai!
Esther!	Mordechai!
You two know each other?	We go to the same temple.
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.	I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?	Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.	When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?	So don't show a picture.	You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.	No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.	Do what you must.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.	Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.	Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...	...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...	Mazel Tov!
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...	...I'm not finished yet, mom.
Mom! We're eating!	What a good poop you made in your diaper Mazel Tov! That's right! Mommy loves you! Such a good boy you are!
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.	Happy Hanukkah Morty.
Okay, what's the information?	She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
Anything else?	Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.
But we're not open on Sundays.	I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.	I'll be in my office.
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?	I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?	Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?	Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.	Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...	Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.	It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother.
What's wrong with him?	He's still working out some identity issues.
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.	I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
Cool. What's it do?	Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!	But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?	Oh yeah. Take a look.
What are you doing?	Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.	A stereo type alarm system?	Take a look.
How do we bypass it?	The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player.	Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
What are you doing?	Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
Hammer, you alright?	Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.	If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.	Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.	The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
What's your shpiel, Santa?	Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering?  Girls.
What are you doing?	I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?	In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
Where's my girlfriend Santa?	I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?	Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?	While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
What should I charge?	Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?	Worse.
Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'	That's some cold shit.
So, how was I?	It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
I wasn't too over the top?	No, it was the perfect level.	Thanks. Oh, did I tell you. I picked up that new KC and the Sunshine Band record that you recommended. You were right, it is good.
You okay?	No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?	I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
Get off of me you cripple!	What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
What's going on? Why'd he stop?	Maybe he ran out of ammo.	Take a look.
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.	Resting?
What day is it?	It's Friday.
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?	No dipshit, I want you to kill him.
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?	Why not?
My soninlaw. What do you think of him?	That depends. How much money has he?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.	I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?	Why not -- if you like it - if that's what you really want.
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and -	Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.	Good looking?	Mmmyes.	Nice fellow?
Is he in love with you?	I don't know -
Why do you ask so many questions? What difference does it make how Carlos and I feel? Feeling does not buy clothes and houses!	Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
"This is for ""mama and the kids."""	What about me?	You get your money from your husband.
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.	It don't look like a leopard to me.
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?	You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.	If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?	I drink.	And when you drink, you get drunk.
Then what do you do?	I sleep it off.	But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?	I don't know.	That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -	Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.	And my leopard - - maybe he hurt the first girl -- but no more.
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.	Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.	No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.	You really think so, Charlie?	That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.	They all say the cat killed this second girl.	They don't say it to me.	I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?	Sure.	Let's get in your truck.
Where's that man?	Up at the museum.
Sure, I like my leopards	But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
Sure!	No. I'm serious about this.
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.	Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
I'm sick.	Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.	No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!
I don't know. I want to see Robles.	What do you want to see him for?	I want him to lock me up.	Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.	I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met	You found the leopard!
What's left of him.	Where? Where did you find it?
North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head - maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone 	What arroyo - how did you get to it 
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --	That's the place: I remember - My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
It's a blackcard and bad card, but not the card of the cat - not the card of fourfooted things.	I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --	) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.	They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.	All men are fools. They like to make a big show - shout and hunt --
What did they say before the bad card came up?	You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.	You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.	Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?	Who?	The elderly man I told you about.
Cut.	What are you doing that for?
Something black - something on its way to you 	Go on -
Don't look at it!	Let me see it 
The death card - -	Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
See you tomorrow -	Tomorrow -
He will be waiting...	You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...	At four. He will be there at four.
Pedro is waiting for me, too.	Rosita  I have wondered -	What, senorita?	When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
Love is different for different people.	I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too  when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret  a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click  click  click.	She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.	Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.	You think be's pretty nice, don't you?	Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches 	You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.	Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.	I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.	"I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it ""fits just perfect."""
Oh, dear -- I don't know what I'm going to do without you - honestly, I don't 	Hey  I'm over here.	I'll miss you too, honey --
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.	Good evening.	You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.	It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths  that's what this procession is supposed to be.	Oh, that's so interesting!	Well, now that you've had your history lesson, I think I'll get on to the museum.
Show business?	"Yes. It's always fascinated me.  You know, once, when I was a youngster, I went to see Mrs. Leslie Carter in ""Zaza."" After the play I stood in the alley just to watch her come out."
Well, I'd best be off.	I want to ask you something.
It's about the leopard.	You're worrying about its killing someone else?	Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.	Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.	You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?	No. I'm quite sure.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?	That's right, of course.	Don't feel so concerned, Jerry.
Doc -- something you said the other day --	Yes?	It doesn't jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it wouldn't stay in the city 	Sure -- certainly - but what's that got to do with this?	That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.	Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.	Why?	It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.	But it doesn't eat what it kills.	Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.	I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
You know Charlie How-Come?	We're old friends.
Come to look around?	More or less.	I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.	About Charlie's leopard?	Yes.
Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.	Charlie likes his leopard.
It could be a man.	It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.	I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?	Some crazy guy.	But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.	A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!	Yes, but what sort of a man?	I don't know.	You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage - eh?
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.	Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?	Some other time.
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.	Just barely possible - - yes.
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?	But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.	All right -- the dead, then.  In history there must have been men like that -- men with kinks in their brains --
Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.	If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.	To the eye? Like other men.	I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?	He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.	Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?	No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.	You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard   Don't you?
It was you, Galbraith!	No.	It was you.	Not! I tell you. No!	You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --	I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.	Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?	It's better you don't know.	Tell me.	Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
Tormented -- ? Why?	I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.	Then you found the leopard --	I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?	To know where that leopard went -  I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back East. I gave that up.
What do you do now?	There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
Why did you give up teaching?	Various reasons.  But I can't see why you'd be interested in the rather dusty career of William Galbraith  teacher, naturalist, curator -- when you lead such a gay and exciting life yourself.
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.	Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.	That was unfortunate.	That was a calamity!
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.	I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.	Thanks.
"I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -"	Miss Walker -- I didn't expect anyone 
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.	I thought they came right past here 	They do, but -- there are no lights out there - they'll just be shadows -
Wait 	No - really, I can see them -- they're coming now - turn off the lights 
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.	Thanks, Sheriff.
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,	Go on foot.	It's not for me.  I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.	Something's wrong with this whole setup --	Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --	I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
What are you getting at?	Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.	Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?	No. He was kidding Charlie.
State hunters?	Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
Yes. The lipstick.	Why?	Ask Kiki. Ask any woman. Girls don't put on lipstick in the middle of the night on a dark, lonely street unless they're with a man or expecting a man.
Chief, don't you understand what this means?	You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.	I'm sure of it!
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so 	I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
That's a fact, isn't it?	Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
You won't go to Galbraith with me?	Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money  not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
Get it out of here!	Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.	Makes no difference. Get him out!	Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...	That's easy. Me.	I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!	On his back, I suppose.	No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.	You're too good to me.	Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?	No - not yet.	And I never will- you know what's between us  we're a thing But this is serious competition.	Get it out of here!	Kiki - he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.	Makes no difference.  Get him out.	Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this time.	That's easy. Me.	I thought - is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.	On his back, I suppose.	No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.	You're too good to me.	Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?	This is l939. Can't you subtract?	Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?	No  not yet.	And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.	Clo-Clo?	I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
You look swell in that threealarm number --	The red dress?  No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
Are you all right?	Now look what you've done.
Suppose I slip them a few bucks  for the funeral expenses.	Don't be soft.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.	And I suppose you don't feel bad!
Who was the other man?	I don't know  a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.	What did he have to do - look at the body?	We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors!	Yeah.	And did you find the leopard?
It must be the altitude  you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys --	The whole town's in a state, Kiki doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night 	Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience	Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
Who is he?	You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
"	As long as my feet held out."	And not a sign of the leopard?
I can use them.	Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.	He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.	I know. Funerals.	Yes.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me 	You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.	Yes. Do you mind?
And she waited here for him?	Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.	Maybe I want to feel badly.	That doesn't make sense.
What else do you care about, Kicks?	You. Us.
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --	Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --	If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.	You're positive of that, aren't you?	Absolutely sure.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --	I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --	Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?	I got into a little crap game.	That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.	What! You can't be --	I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --	Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.	All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways 	Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.	How do you know?
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.	We will 
Kiki?	It's all right. I'm not hurt.
We stood here once before.	I know -- Teresa -	I hated you that day - you and your flip talk - with that little girl lying dead.	"I know. What do you think I felt when you said, ""don't be soft?"""	Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside - where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.	We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
It's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.	Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Whys that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess theres space enough for war games... Must be good for business.	Must it?	All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?	Aint nobody out there, Mister.	Nobody? Huh!... How come?	Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...	Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?	You a tourist?
Thats right.	Will you please come with me?	That might depend on where youre going.	I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes majordomo. They are expecting you.	De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.	That would be Mrs De Moraes mother, Sir. Mr and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter.
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.	Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?	Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.	When will they be back?	Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistresss brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?	I work here, sir. Im here most of the time.	You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?	You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?	No. Thank you. Ill be fine...
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brothers death.	Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
Now you know why youre here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.	Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.	That depends what youre looking at.
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasnt here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over £1,000 to get rid of him.	And that is the last time any...	Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art!  Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought.
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?	I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.	Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?	Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.	Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The £1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
I wont comment on the time but youll understand if I dont tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard.	Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.	For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.	I dont know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.	Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Dont. You might get confused speaking of things you dont understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until youve done what we are paying you for.	Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.	Can it be that easy?	Can it be that you want your brother found?	Anything is possible.
I found this at your brothers.	Disney! How inter...	Its a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. Im told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you dont require a definition.	You... You found that at Leons?	Theres more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for £15,000.
You seem surprised. Could it be you dont think that badly of him after all?  You neednt worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.	What... What are you talking about?	Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You dont mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is hes either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But Ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why Im here at such a late hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.	Excuse me?	I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.	Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?	I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.	Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.	Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brothers not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than hed bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news...
How dare you...  You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?	The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.	No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.	Excuse me?	Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.	Perhaps I should come back when youre...	No. Youre fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
Laurence!	I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.	Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?	Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?	Couldnt Nazi hunters do the job?
I still dont buy your story but I figured it cant do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.	You drive a hard bargain.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?	Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
You lost my money?	You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.	Who is Friedman?	The man who sold the boy to your brother.	Im impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.	Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight Im convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
Are we understood?	You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. Theyre in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.	Huh! Really? Hotels?	The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.	W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.	You do want me to keep the job, dont you, Mrs De Moraes?
Mr Lombard?	Have you got a pen?	Just a moment...  Go ahead.	The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...	...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?
Are you all right?	Yes... You woke me up... Its the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?	Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?	Paul Lamont...?	Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...	Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
Mr Lombard...	How are you, Mrs De Moraes?	When did you get back?	Why dont you ask when I left the Mondrian?
Im really sorry you were not called...	Youre repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.	I... Well, were burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but its late and with the funeral...	Arent you curious to know about Friedman?	I... If you dont mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. Theres no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you?
Black suits you.	Sorry?	Whats in the bag? Underwear? To seduce your husband? Or is it for your own recreation?  Tell me, how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it with little children?
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him?	You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...	You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing dont learn to pick locks between shopping trips.  Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesnt suit you! Who knew Id found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, whod want to make sure it didnt fall into the wrong hands?	Youre mad...	Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?	Why... I dont know what youre talking about.	You know hed have had him killed, dont you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?	Have you finished?	When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it womans intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?	I guess the news youd sent me after Friedman didnt go down too well, eh?
Whatever the reason, Im sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.	You knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance, didnt you?	Huh! Dont you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.	I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...	How... When did you...	It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. Whats harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?	No!
What do you mean, No, Mrs De Moraes?	My brother hung himself.	Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.	Leon hung himself.	Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...	Leon hung himself...	Leons not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leons found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned Id exceeded his expectations.	Leon hung himself...	Leon didnt hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.	...You-you spoke to him?	Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
Your brother stumbled upon Adoniss little secret, didnt he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kids life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldnt be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? Leon does his own prints. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps its the way you say them...	If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why dont you accuse me of killing my brother?	Kids are not your thing, Deborah. Youd have been ready for me when I turned up with Sleeping Beauty. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. Not Leon, you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didnt say My God!, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. Not Leon. Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman Id stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didnt you?	Leon could still have hung himself.	Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. Hed never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed too.
Youre wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought hed wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I dont know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didnt know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.	You dont say.	That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?	I didnt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? Ive known for five years. Hes known Ive known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnt speak about...	One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?	Think what you like. But dont presume to understand.	I dont.	Good.	Is there anything to understand?	Why do I feel I neednt answer that?	Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.	You bastard...	Five years of it. Surely, youd have divorced him if he disgusted you?	You splendid bastard...	Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?	...Were turning in circles.	And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.	Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.	A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?	I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!	What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?	Something like that.	Something like that?	Something like that.	What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?	Here we go again.	Where is that?	Simplify and damn.	Dont you believe in simplicity?	Should I?	We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But its never that complicated really.	You seem to know what youre talking about.	Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.	My husband didnt need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...	To get me killed...?	I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...	Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.	Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. Thats when he hit me, and told me hed killed my brother... You dont know what youve done, he said.  Were in deep trouble, he said. We, he said. We.  Wed both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
You know something? Ive just seen so much ugliness I dont think Id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  Id hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if thats the way you want it.	What are you doing? You cant. I...	Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brothers not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...	He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. Theyll tell you. Call them!
Do you think wed let him get away with the murder of my brother?	We? You and your parents killed your husband?	No. Not us...
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.	Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.	The staff dont know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldnt take any more...	Get to the point, will you...	My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged...
So you did talk about it, huh?	On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?	What do you suggest?	I dont know. Everyones dead...	Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
Why the hell couldnt you divorce the man?	You wouldnt understand.
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...	The dead can wait.
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?	Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.	01766 770 471. Let me check it for you, sir.
Theres nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.	A call box? Thats odd. Where exactly?	Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.	Can you tell me how you spell...
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?	A coffee and a couple of croissants.	Crow what?	Croissants.	Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?	Croissants. Like that...
The word for those things is croissants.	Not in America, sir. You must be from Europe.  So, black coffee and a couple of crescents.
May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?	Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England.	Youre a long way from home...
You wouldnt have a cigarette, would you?	I dont smoke. If you could get to the point...
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?	Im fine standing, thank you.
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?	A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
I cant believe this...  Whats coming now, eh? If I dont pay all Hells gonna break loose, is that it?	Well, Id sooner mug an old lady...	You...  Jesus Christ!
Okay. The woman just cant walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why cant you go to your Embassy?	French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didnt have any. I used a British passport. My names not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why cant you go back there?	The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.	By your Austrian?	Yeah.
You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?	No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...	Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile Id sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...	There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?	I thought youd never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... Theres a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?	I know where to look.	I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it wont be for a couple of hours.
Thereve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, its just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?	I wouldnt mind. Thank you.
A recent acquisition. Weve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flats been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.	Hah... What about Nathalie?	No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?	Im sure Ill find a way.	Like youll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what were doing here?	How come youre alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?	Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
Its give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didnt really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?	A criminal?	Did you not enter this country illegally?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...	Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didnt I hear you right?
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my sons. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... Theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry.	Thank you. But I think Ill go to bed. Its been a long day.	Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.	Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.	Dont fall asleep with your hair wet.
What am I to do with the packages if...	Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
Get a pen and dont ask any questions.	Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.	Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. Theres a dirt track with a Closed to the public sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?	Have you found your man? Is that where he is?	I think so. And if it comes to it, tell the cops anything you think will make them move. Whatever you came up with couldnt come close to how bad it is. Bye now.
Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?	Whos the guy? Whos the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate Id have had to kill him.
What...?	What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. Theres a lot of people back there. Theyre holding a seminar. Traffickings the past, breeding the future...
Friedmans dead... They killed him...	So who... Whos the man? Where is he?	Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.	Italian? The Mafia...?	Who knows. Who cares...  You wanted slime. You got slime.
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...	Were both thinking the same thing, right?	Do you know a friendly cop?
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?	That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...	Im finished here and Im tired, Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse.	A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late.	Then find another way.	Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For gods sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this!	Its up to you whether they walk or not.
...Im Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this thats who I am. Do you get what Im fucking saying, Mr Lombard?	What about your friendly cop?	My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks Im obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son.  But hes a good guy. Hell listen to you. He wont turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay?
Theyd never let me go. And youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.	You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.	I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.	Huh! And they say charitys only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitneys trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...	And losing you, wed lose him. And that would be a shame, dont you agree?
Hi...	If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...	Most of our information comes out of the mouths of babes, Mr Lombard - confused and frightened victims. Its all too easily discredited, you understand. Now, you might be just what weve been waiting for. Your information could be enough to make em sit up and listen.
Weve still got the Italian...	Thats right. Wheres the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!	Emily...	No. Youre looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there.  Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit...  Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?
Shit! Fuck! Whats fucking wrong with people!  Im going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to!	Shell be alright. Shes tough...
Im calling about the puppies.	Have we done business before?	I saw the ad at Georges.  Im passing through town and Im in a hurry.	May I have your phone number?	Why?	This is a bad line.
What sort of puppy are you looking for?	What sort have you got?	Pups. Bitches. From three to twelve months.  Trained and untrained ones. White and brown ones. You understand?	Yeah.	We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?	Yes... Good, good...	So, what are you looking for?	What about an untrained pup, white...	How much of a hurry are you in?	Tomorrow?	Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...	I see. How much?	Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.	... Fine. Ill go for the safe place.	Have the money ready by 11am. Well call you.
On the bed!	What...?
Where is the Austrian?	You... Fuck you!
Youre not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?	Jee... Fuck... Youre fucking mad!
Who are you?	Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?	Yes. Friedmans the fuckin Austrian!	Where is he?	I dont know. Hes gone!  Hes gone. I dont fucking know where, I swear... Hes gone. On holiday...	...On holiday?	Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees...
Whos the money man?	Who?  Martin... Hes Martin...
Ever seen him before?	No... No...  I swear...	Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?	Yeah... The Diplomat.	Where?	What?	Where are we?	Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.	Where are the kids?	What kids?	There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?	I dont know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I dont know where the kids are... I work for Martin, thats all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...	And who does Friedman work for?	The company. We all work for the company.	What company?	I dont know. I dont know, man. I dont even know Friedman that well... I...  Man, youve got to get me out of here...	How many of you scumbags are here?	Just me...  Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...	Whats the Ambassador?	Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. Hes got a safe...  I need a doctor...	What about the staff?  Theyre in on whats going on, arent they?  How many of them?	F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, Ive got to get to...
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?	B-Black...	Where is it?	Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
Im sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?	Ill call again.
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?	Can I have the reception desk, please.
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?	Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.	Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?	Got it. Puppies.
You sure you passed on my message?	I certainly did, sir...
Hello again, neighbour. I didnt intrude, did I?	How are you, Jane?	Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?	No.	Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.	Good.	Yes. But my boss reckons youd still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? Itd cost you about £100 but he said itd be worth it.  Of course, youd need a partner to register. But thats a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?	La what?	La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?	Should I?	I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?	That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many.	So you havent seen the film, then?	Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?	Oh... We split up.	Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...	Oh no. Im all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
Ive got work tonight, Jane.	Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, thats what they do to their employees, isnt it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives. Thanks for the lift!
Shes pretty... See you, huh?	Bye bye, Jane. And dont be naughty.
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...	Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelquun récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie...	Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...	Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?	No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe its there with...	Its not.	Well, Im sorry. I...  This is my nephew... And my brother, Tim. Ive got the week off and hes come to stay.
Piss off!	Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. Its important.
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?	Your secretary, huh!	Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry.	What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
Hello, Jane. Its me.	Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...	Carlos De Moraes?	Yes. How did...	Thank you, Jane.
Good afternoon, Mrs...?	Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his.
May I...?	May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?	I hope its not too significant.	What if it is?	Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldnt like to think Id kept you waiting for nothing.
Whatever, you come recommended. We...	Recommended?	Must I speak to you in French?	Didnt you say I came recommended?  Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?	You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.	Okay. Recommended...	Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?	Look Mrs Spitz... I dont know to whom Im indebted for the recommendation but... Im not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.	What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
I take it your son is called Leon?	Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?	You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.	How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?	Do what, Mr Lombard?	Check with your sons bank. Banks dont usually give out information about their customers.	I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.	I didnt mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.	Then you should not have sought an explanation.	I presume you checked your sons apartment...	Yesterday. It all looked normal.	Did you look for his passport, driving licence?	Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.	So he could have decided to go on a trip...	He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.	Then why arent you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?	No. And before you ask, no, hes not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...	Any friends?	The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonards address, keys and other things you might need.	Im sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?	When... Im told he came here...
The £1,000 is on account.	My rates...	We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.	Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?	Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.	Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?	Plus a trust fund to provide for the boys education.
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.	Jah...
What happens now?	We conclude our transaction.
The rooms yours for 24 hours. Its sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.	Anything at all?	Anything at all. I presume you wont want to take the boy with you when youre finished?  Theres a £500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand?
Vous êtes Français?	Does it matter?
Problems?	Is my money in there?	Uh-huh. You couldve waited for me inside.
Lets go.	I dont know what your problem is, but...	Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate.
Am I supposed to know him?	Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.	Clients come and go.	This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.	Huh, I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
Where is Friedman?	Look, I dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?	No. In Hampstead... Why?	Dont jump any red lights.
This car needs petrol.	Shut up and drive!
Youre out of your mind. Whats the idea?	Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, lets go...
Is it real?  You people are sick.	Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and were out of business.	Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?	Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.	Maybe I dont.	Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.	Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.	Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where theyre not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.	Huh... Im sure thered be lots of takers.	Could someone have hurt you that bad?
Is this Friedman?	Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?	Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?	Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...	You seem very sure about that.	I told you... The rabble, its me...  Huh... Its sad.	What is?	Dying without ever reaching the top...
Trying to say something, Martin?	Hyatt... Friedmans... at the Hyatt...	The Hyatt...? Whats that?	Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
Its about the puppy. You got the money?	Yeah.	At what time will you be available?	Three oclock.	Le Mercury. Newman street. Ask for Peter.
What is it?	This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. Im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.	What are you talking about?	We need a double-room and as I understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room...
Five to three. Youre early.	Should I come back in five minutes?
I gather weve done business with a friend of yours?	Have you?	The person who put us in touch seems to think so.	I dont recollect mentioning a friend.
Your lady friend did.	The ladys not a friend. Shes a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?	An Austrian.	An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?	Questions can amount to revelations. Now, Id hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...	Ill be alone.	You must agree to be blindfolded...  Just for the journey. It might appear unseemly - youre the paying customer - but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement.
Evening. Table for one?	No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?	Leon? No. Im afraid he left.	Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...	No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.	Oh. This is... Wed arranged to meet tonight and Im due to return to Paris tomorrow...	Im sorry...	Yes. You wouldnt know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.	How are you, Rhian?
Its wet. Will this do?	Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?	Is this some kind of mugging? Because...	Shut up! Wheres your wallet?	In my jacket. Left inside pocket.	Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My fingers on the trigger, you hear!
A private investigator... Youre not Austrian?	Should I be?	Whats a French private investigator doing here?	Can I get up now?	No! What do you want here? How do you know me?	As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.	...Leons not here. How did you get here? Phil doesnt know where I live.	Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leons not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.	You thought wrong. I havent seen Leon for months.	Havent you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? Id have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.	You-youre wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time Im in London. Thats all.
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you hes terrified of men, so...	Shut up!
We didnt quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...	Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?	He just said he had good reasons.	Good reasons?	Thats what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldnt take on another child, that hed get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasnt listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think hes back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some peoples minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leons. He did beat the drug, though. He did.	His mother would be pleased to hear that.	Yeah... But he didnt beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.	Im afraid I dont understand.	Theyre German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. Its not guilt, more of a curse...  And then theres something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think thats just one of Leons dark delusions...	Do you know Leons parents names?	Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
Who else knows about the boy?	My sister... She lives in the next valley.	Is she on the phone?	Yes...You-youre not going to take Shiva away?
I cant think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. Whats your sisters number?	Oh, I... She just moved. Ive got her new... Its in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leons Austrian was looking for you I reckon hed have found you before I did.	Im sorry. Its just you dont look local...	No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it?	Hed come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... Sleeping Beauty. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldnt watch...
Whats the date?	The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?	Ive been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?	Er... Yes...	Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?	He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didnt... It hurt him. They used to be close...  Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another, Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?	Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...	Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?	... No.	You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?	... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...	Hows the boy doing?	Fine...	Good. You neednt worry about the Austrian anymore. Hes dead. Ill be in touch.
And you aint neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?	No...	I didnt think so. The rags on their sorry backs are the only wordly possessions those wretched creatures are ever found with...  I dont wanna know who you are or how come you ended up roasting in Owl Canyon. But you might as well know Id have let you fry to a buzzard meal if not for this...
Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?	I... How long have I been here?	Three days and thats three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up.
Huh... I guess you aint quite ready for civilisation yet... Ill give you one more day, a meal, and then youre on your way.	Los Angeles?	Los Angeles is 100 miles away.	Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.	Im sure you would. But if I had one, I wouldnt let you near it. Now you tuck back in and rest until youre told otherwise.  And for what its worth, I wouldnt try anything that might be construed as unappreciative of my hospitality. Id sooner shoot you than have you upset me...
Barstows 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever youre heading, I reckon somebodyll pick you up.	Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...	Is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists?  You go to your world, Ill stay in mine. So long, Mister.
Welcome to the club.	Excuse me?	I hear youre looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leons gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?	Uh-huh.	No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.	I take it you dont know where he is, then?	Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon, do you?	I know his work better than I know him.	Let me put it this way then; the photographs and the man? One and the same, man, one and the same. At best fucking weird, at worst fucked-up fucking weird. Maybe you should think yourself lucky. Some folks just aint worth getting involved with. And Leon sure is one of em.	What about his girlfriend?	What about which girlfriend?	Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.	Oh. Thatd be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...	Would you know where I might reach her?	Yeah! Somewhere in Wales. I dont really know her. Used to turn up in a Transit van on weekends, sell old furniture at Camden. Thats how come he only laid her at weekends, ha ha...	Could that be Camden Market?	Yeah. Why? Youre going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?	Fucked-up fucking weird.
Quest-ce que tu veux?	Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.
Whats an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!	Cinq cents.	Viens.
Jai bien peur quil te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matinée.	Tu sais où me trouver.
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...	Où est passé ton salon?	Mon bureau coûtait trop cher.	Eh bien... Tes sûr que tas besoin de moi?  La petite ma lair assez bien foutue, non?
Alors?	Alors quoi?	Le montage, lemballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?	A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc.  I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.	But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.	Then why dont you reach him?	I dont have your credentials, Nathalie.
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.	If you can, send me a receipt.
Okay, shitbag. Im only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?	Who?  I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.	Gluck.	Figlio di puttana. Youre the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...	Five seconds. Then you die.	Fuck...	Three...	Glucks dead, you sonofabitch!
Youre the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see whats left of him...	The acid bath?	Huh! Youve been around, eh?
Why did you kill Friedman?	Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. Its wrong. Fucking wrong.	Why did you kill him?	Huh! You turned him into a liability, didnt you know?	Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.	Thats just it. The sonofabitch didnt ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasnt gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
Are you telling me Friedman didnt tell you I was here looking for him?	If he had, youd be dead.	So why didnt he?	What do you think, huh?	I think youd rather not know what I think.	Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldnt go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.	So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?	Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, French-fuck?
Try again, and this time be polite.	I can only tell you what he told us...	Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.	Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman whod called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.	What sums?	Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didnt need your confession...	Youre sure he said his caller was a man?	Thats what he said...
When they realise Im missing...	Shut up and walk...
What you gonna do? Kill me?	Dont tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.	Huh. Im a businessman. What are you, eh?
Moreau? Cest moi. Alors...	Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasnt easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, whats your business with these Spitzes?	They lost their son. Why?	It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.	Are they still operative?	Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, Id watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The ladys also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.	Mossad?	Its a good guess...
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...	Cost what?	Costliest!	Whats that? A word?	What do you think?	I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?	Very funny. Can I go on now?	Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.	That's a good idea, sire.	What do you mean?	Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...	... if she can find me? -- That's a brilliant idea!  If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man!  Bring her up!
Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon?  The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?	My lord, I'm not sure that...
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!	Majesty, I can't...	Why, are you not ready to die for your king?	Of course I am, it's just that...	Good.  Until then, feel free to live like a king!
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.	So... pretend it's not a game.
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.	Yes, my lord.
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...	Very generous of you all.  How much?	10,000 gold crowns.
My dear Aulon...  That's fine...	Jeanne's been badly injured!  She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
It's a miracle she's not dead!	We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...	Jean, it's... it's not so easy...	But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...	Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?	No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?	Tremoille... don't.  Please...
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...	Do you think I could have some water?
I would like some fresh straw.	Louis... water and fresh straw!
And I would like to see a priest.	Now?	Yes.  I didn't confess today.	Right.  Raymond... a priest.
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.	Now?	Better today than tomorrow.	Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
I also need someone who can read and write.	This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.	I thought you were an archer?	Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?	The King of England.  I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
Who do they think I am?!	Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.	There's nothing to hear -- I haven't done anything.  And why haven't I done anything?  Because none of you will listen to me!!
Jeanne, stop it!	How dare you stop me doing God's will!
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!	How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!	Alright, whatever -- but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!
What did they say?	Uh... they said... they will think about it.	Good.	But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
What's going on?!	They've started the battle without me!
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...	Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...	No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.	I promise...
The king said you're his finest archer...?	Well...	Come with me...
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?	Yes...	It's over, Jeanne.  We won, just as you said!
I'll go.	Jeanne, no...
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?	Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?	Because there's an arrow in your leg.
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.	So... what am I supposed to do now?
They've abandoned me... like everyone.	What... what do you mean?	It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...	Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?	It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.	But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.	But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?	All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.	But how do you know what you hear is the truth?	I don't know it.  I feel it.	You make it sound so simple...	The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.	Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!	So... even you don't believe in me anymore...	Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.	Tell me...	Tell the king to give me more men.
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?	You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
What did the king say?	He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...	It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!	Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...	No, but...	Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?	Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?	To marry you.
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.	Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.	I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.	But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?	But it is what I want.	To be killed in battle?	If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
Will you at least let me stay with you?	It would not be the same without you.
We must sound the retreat!	Not yet!
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!	But... why... what's the point?	Do as I say!	I want to stay with you...	That's an order!
I am ready now...	Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...	I'm already free...	Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.	I -- I don't understand...	One day you will.	You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!	I'm staying, Jean.	No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!	I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...	Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
Jeanne's alive!	Good.	We have to press home the attack!	Sound the retreat...	But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!	I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!	But that was her order!	I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...	You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!	No...	Did God forbid you to tell the truth?	No.  But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
Go onto the next question.	Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?	I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?	I tried to.	It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?	I don't remember.  Maybe.	Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?	I don't know...	And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?	"No... I said ""Surrender in the name of the King of France""..."	That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
I can't read.	Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?	I leave the answer to God.
Do you have a sword?	Quite a few.	Didn't you also carry a banner?	Yes...	Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?	I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.	And why was that?  Did it have some particular value or power?	No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.	And?	And so I... I prefer my banner.	Why?	To avoid killing anyone.	Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...	Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?	No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?	We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...	Yes, probably... maybe...	So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?	Yes, but...	Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?	No, I... I held it up to...	You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?	Yes, maybe... I don't remember...	... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?	No, I... I never killed anyone!
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?	Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...	And when was that?	Well... at the coronation of King Charles VI...	Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...	No no, you don't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral...
W-w-what are you doing?!	Performing a miracle.
Arrest them!	What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!	Rouen is in English territory.  I have the right to do anything I like.  Take them away.
Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?	She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...	To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?	But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...	We want her burned as a witch!	But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...	Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!	How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!	Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...	So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.	... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...	But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...	Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...	Scared of a girl?	Scared to make a mistake.  Supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by God??
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?	I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.	Well find some other way!  Be creative.  Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that?  Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...	Am I... am I dead?	Dead you're worthless, darling.	Where... where am I?	Guess.
My king will pay any ransom you ask.	Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.	God defeated the English, not me.	And God who allowed you to be caught?
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?	No no, I'm fine, really...	I was so worried -- we've all been looking for you!  The English are everywhere!  O thank you, lord!
Really?	I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
Quick -- hide in here...	What about you?	Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!	But where are you going to be?	I'll be right here... I promise.
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?	I will hear you... but not now, not here.	Who are you?	Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.	Trial?  What trial??	Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.	But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?	It seems that the English care more about you than the French.	The English??	Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.	I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.	I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.	I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?	My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?	In a village called Domremy.	How old are you?	Nineteen... or thereabouts...	Were you baptized?	Yes.  In the church at Domremy.	Recite the Lord's Prayer.	Not unless you hear my confession.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?	Not unless you hear my confession.
Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...	And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
Jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.	These questions have nothing to do with your trial.	I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?	Not long ago...	When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?	Last night.
What were you doing when the voice came?	Praying.	The voice was in your cell?	Yes.	What did it tell you?	Many things...	Did it give you advice?  Good advice?
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?	Yes...	Is it here?  Now?  In this room?
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.	So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.	I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??	No... I want to be confessed.
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.	And may I go to Mass?	As often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of God -- sign!!
Please... may I have it back...	You have nothing to regret...
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!	Silence her!  Take her away...!
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?	And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...	I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!	It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...	I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?	He's feeling wonderful.	Thanks be to God.	And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?	Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...	Buying her?	This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...	I understand.  How much?
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.	Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...	You think?	Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.	W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?	Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?	You really think she's been sent... by God?	You're a fine judge of character, Charles.  It'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake.  But if she's not -- then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head.
You will??	For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...	I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...	I... I can't stop her.
Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.	But... her army's so small now...	Then her faith will have to be bigger.
There's no need to be afraid, sire.	I'm... I'm not the king...	I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.	You did well...	I didn't wait long.  One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
... and what... what did he say?	He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...	Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference.  Take some rest.
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...	... You look wonderful...	... and my crown doesn't fit and...  Really??
Get them out of here!	Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!	Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?	Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...	So how would you put it?	"Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, ""to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace""..."	Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!	Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
She pretends she's been sent by God! These charlatans -- it's a pity there isn't enough wood to burn them all!	She says she'll be here tomorrow...!	You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.	What difference does it make where she comes from?	"If she comes from Burgundy it makes a difference.  It might be a trap...  Look... Signed ""X"".  What sort of name is ""X""?  Or must we conclude that a messenger of God can't even write her own name?"
Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.	I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?	The other half.
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!	My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?	Supposing she's an assassin?	Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
Your majesty, I really think you...	My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...	... as always, majesty...	... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
My captains have sworn their support.	No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...	There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...	Let them come!  Let them see who's the true king of France!
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?	Noooo!
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?	If there was, I didn't see it...	Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?	Go and ask him yourself.
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?	His face.	Does he have hair?	Yes.	Is it long and hanging down?	I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.	But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?	Go on to the next question.	That's enough!  You will answer the question... or face the consequences!
5,000 gold crowns.	That's not a lot.	It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.	I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.	May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?	20,000 gold crowns.
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.	I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?	Yes... they were.	Good.  Where are the English?	Everywhere.  Where is the food?	It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...	I know...	Good.  Can you bring me to him?	He's on the other side of the river.
Wait, wait...	For what?	Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?	Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!	Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.	You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!	Fine -- go now if you want, but not with me!  You may have a duty to God but I have a duty to my people, and my people are starving!  So right now I'm going to take the food back to the city, and if you can please calm down, and let me accompany you to Orleans, it will be my honor to welcome you.
So... what is the message?	We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?	God.
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.	Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...	What complicated about it?  All you have to do is do what you're told -- what could be simpler than that? I'm the drum on which God is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it's bursting my ears -- but you're all so full of your own voices, you're deaf to His!
"""Be patient, be patient""... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!"	Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.	Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.	Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?	Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude.
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!	Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?	Sooner is better than later!
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...	The wind will be against us...	The wind will be with us!  Do as I say.
What's going on?	We're taking back the Tourelles!
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...	I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
Stand by with the battering-rams...	We need another ten minutes...	The bridge won't wait!
Well...?  Shall we go?	Not yet.	The English won't wait.
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!	Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?	The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!	Yes, it's a miracle.	And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...	Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?	As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?	That'll put fire in my soldiers!
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.	Damn right!	Oh, but I forgot!  It was a Sunday... that explains it.  God's day off.
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!	Me too...
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!	Yes.  We can pray.	Good idea...
This is no good!	No good?  This is a disaster!
And... what does Jeanne think?	I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.	But the bridge has been pulled down!	The English are rebuilding it.
Clear?	Perfectly.
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?	No... not like this...	For weeks you've been asking for this... well now you have it!
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?	I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?	Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!	I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!	Jeanne... we're not enough...	So... bring up the reinforcements!	Reinforcements?  Where??
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!	Jeanne, look behind you.	Never look behind -- only ahead!
Do you know how to count?	Of course I do?  Bring them up!	Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.	But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?	He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...	But my voices... they promised me...	To hell with your voices -- it's time to face facts!  We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you.  You should go home, Jeanne.
Who told you to wear men's clothes?	The clothes are not important...	You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...	It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...	So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?	I... submit to Our Lord.	But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?	It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?	I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.	Did your voice tell you to jump?	No...	So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?	No...!	"How can you deny it when you just said ""I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English""...?"	That's now what I meant...	Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!	I know, but that's not the way things happened...	You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?	Yes, but...	And you didn't jump of your free will?	No!	Oh?  Perhaps someone pushed you then?
Stop it!  What are you doing?	Nothing... just taking his teeth.	But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!	Why not?  He has good teeth...	Because... because you just can't!
Besides, what about these...?	That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
Yeah...	Here -- take this instead.
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??	Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!	La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!	Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.	Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!	They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?	God knows, but it was a bad idea!	Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...	Don't swear...
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!	I'd sooner die than use magic!
Prepare these as battering-rams!	What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!	Not for long...
We... won?!	Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...	... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!	It's not possible...
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!	Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...	If you kill him, you kill me!
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...	A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...	I said, kneel!
You don't believe me anymore?	We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If it were up to me, I'd chase every goddamn Englishman into the ocean. But it's not up to us anymore -- it's up to the king...
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?	Yes... a half-steed... white.	Who gave you that horse?	My king.	How many did he give you?	Five steeds and a few hackneys...	As much as for a Lord?  What an honor!  Did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?	No.	What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?	Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...	Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?	And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
Jeanne... what are you doing?	Playing...
What have you done to me?	I -- I -- I...
Who... who are you...?	I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one...
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?	No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
I don't know... I thought...	YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?	I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...	WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?	I... don't know... what do you want from me?	Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
What are you doing out here?	I might ask you the same question.	I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...	And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?	Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!	You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...	I... I never lied!	If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...	I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...	"How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  ""What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"""
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?	No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!	I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!	Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?	I don't understand.  What do you want from me?	I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
Why were you yelling like that?!	What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...	Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?	Yes!	Who?
My... visions...	They're going to come and visit you in here?	Yes... that's what I pray for...!	I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.	No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!	Why not?	Because... I have to be alone!
They won't come anyway.	What do you mean, they won't come?	Why would they?	Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...	God asked you to do something?	Yes... lots of things!	"You mean God said, ""I need you, Jeanne?"""	No, but... he sent me so many signs!	What signs?	Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!	No.  That was a sword in a field.	But... it didn't just get there by itself.	True -- every event has an infinite number of causes -- but why pick one rather than another?  There are many ways a sword might find itself in a field...
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!	Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory...
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!	Oh no?  How about this one?
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...	So your memory's coming back?	"Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's ""the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..."" he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?"	Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?	No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?	In His name??	Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!	Really?
"""Let all who love me follow me""... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name."	I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?	No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?	No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.	I agree...
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?	Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?	Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?	I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?	Really?
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...	What are you doing on the wall?	I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...	What for?	Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.	Do you think this cross will protect you?	No, I...
"""Love your enemies""..."	"Good.  But ""love your enemies""... body and soul."
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?	I don't think so.	Are you going to leave me too?	Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.	Are you sent by God?
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...	Do you think you are ready?
Yes I am.	Are you willing to follow all His commandments?	Yes...	... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...	No...
You think you are ready now?	Yes, my lord.	Let's see.
You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...	I need to confess.	But you already confessed this morning...	I need to confess again.	So... alright.  What terrible sin have you committed since then that can't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven?
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.	There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.	They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.	Whose were they?	My father's.	I'm sure he'll forgive you.	He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.	Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.	Is that bad?	Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?	Oh yes... very.	And your mother -- everything's fine with her?	Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?	Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?	Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
So... everything sounds... wonderful?	Yes, it is.	Then... why are you here so often?	I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.	Him?	Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.	"Who is this ""he""?"	He never says his name.	What... does he... look like?
Beautiful.	And what does he say to you?
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?	Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...	Why did she have to die?	Only God knows the answer to that.	I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!	I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.	Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!	Jeanne... calm down...!  Calm down, Jeanne!
I don't want to wait for his call.	Jeanne, be patient.	I want to be with him always...	Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.	I want to be at one with Him now.
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.	Who wants me to stop?
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?	It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Someone you know?	Yes.
A beauty. Who is she?	A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.	Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they hang them for helping Jews.
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.	Oh, yes. I remember.
I'm going to get a doctor.	You can't, it's too dangerous.	I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.	Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.	He's still a doctor.
Hello.	I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.	Who are you?	My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.	It's nothing.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.	You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.	Really?	Yes!  It was...it was unforgettable.
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.	Wladek, please.	No one plays Chopin like you.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.	Wladek, please.
Dorota!	I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.	How are you doing?	Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.	Don't worry, it won't last long.	That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!	I'll see you...soon.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.	Dorota.	Come in! come in!
Sit.	I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.	Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.
I need help.	He'll be back before curfew.	I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.	He'll be here soon.
How long have you been married?	Just over a year.
And how's Yurek?	Dead.
When's your baby due?	Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
What did I tell you?	What are you doing?
Will I still be able to play?	Let's find out.
Let me see this.	Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.	How will we sleep?
For what? For my tie?	American Jews, and there's lots of them, what have they done for us? What do they think they're doing? People here are dying, haven't got a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany!
It's not going to be very comfortable.	I'll be fine.	You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
Must feel better this side of the wall.	Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.	Here.
Get your things together, you have to leave!	What's happened?
I'm on the run!	What's happened?	The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.	Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?	That's your decision.  But when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - don't let them get you alive. I have poison on me, they won't get me alive either!
Have you seen this?	What, I'm working, what?
What's happened?	Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!	Calm down, what, what is it?	They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
Halina?	What?	Funny time to say this.	What?	wish I knew you better.	Thanks.
Henryk's in there.	I haven't seen him.	Believe me, they've picked him up.	Tough luck.	Can you help?	Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!	Can you help us?	It costs.	I've no money.	Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..	Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.	Who told you?	People I know. They said you're an important man.
We're recruiting.	Who's recruiting?	Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...	Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!	Someone's got to do it, Henryk.	But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...	Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?	Yes, please.	I'm doing you people a favour. And what about you, Wladek? You're a great pianist. And we've got an excellent police jazz band. They'd welcome you with open arms. Join us. You've got no work...
And suppose they take the table away?	What d'you mean, take the table away?	The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.	Do they?
What's this about?	Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.	Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
Henryk, I said nothing bad.	What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
Boys, boys...	Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
They bombed us, we're off the air.	Warsaw's not the only radio station.
Mama, that was a great dinner.	It certainly was.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --	That makes a change.	You know what we do? We use psychology.	We use what?	We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.	Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.	A good place for what?  He's insane!	Just shut up.
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!	No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
You sell anything?	Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.	That's better than yesterday.	Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.	I know.	You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
It's not funny.	Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.	What are you talking about, my tie? What's my tie got to do with anything? I need the tie for my work.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?	You're out, aren't you?
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?	I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.	What did you pay him?	Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!	I can look after myself!	They were taking you away.	It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?	You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.	That's also my business.
What's the matter? Are you sick?	Hungry.
What's that mean, no employment certificate?	You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...	Otherwise what?	You'll be deported.
What are you reading?	'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
Very appropriate.	Yes, that's why I brought it.
No one thought they'd hold out so long.	should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.	Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.	Yes, so did the Germans.	They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?	Yes, but what good did it do?	What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with  dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else?  Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.	You're amazing, Jehuda.	No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.	So, what's the news?	The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.	I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.	Bad news, you crazy? You have no world view, Wladek, that's your trouble. The news couldn't be better. The moment Hitler invaded Russia, I knew we'd be all right. Remember Napoleon. Same business. The Germans will freeze to death, please God.
Jehuda, give me something to do.	You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.	But I want to help, I want to.	You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.	There are always notices going up.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.	Toilets?
I thought you'd be off on tour, playing London, Paris, New York?	Not this week.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?	You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?	Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.	I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...	Why didn't you come to me?	I didn't know you were in the certificate business.	I'm not, but Majorek is.	Can you help? I've no money...	Please, don't insult us.  Can you do something for him?
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.	Wladek! How are you?	Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?	Fine, we're fine in the circumstances. But I can guess what you've called about. There's nothing we can do; they won't reopen the station--	Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...	...not even music, nothing, no radios for the Poles. But I'm sure you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist like you.	Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't be offended, I didn't call to discuss my future career.
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?	What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.	You know what? You treat me like dirt!	I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.	Pig!	Cow!	Pig!	Bitch!	Dirty pig!	You're a dirty pig!	Takes one to know one! Pig!
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?	I was listening, Kitten.	Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
How long have you been here?	Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.	If you need help...
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.	It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.	I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.	You made contact?	Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.	It's a little cut, nothing.	I've been worried sick.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.	Where are we going?	Out of Warsaw.	Out of Warsaw. Where?
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?	Pack, Wladek, there's no time.	I'm not going anywhere.
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.	God forbid!
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.	Stop it, Wladek.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?	No, I don't think so?	Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.	Sorry, I don't remember.	Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.	Why didn't you come sooner? It's been over two weeks.
What the hell are you doing?	I was... I was trying to open this tin.	Where do you live?
What's your work?	I am... I was a pianist.	A pianist.
Where are you hiding?	In the attic.	Show me.
What's all that gunfire?	The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
What's happening?	We're getting out.
Are the Russians here?	Not yet.
I don't know how to thank you.	Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
What about you?	I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?	I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.	Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.	Szpilman.	Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
Watch your feet!	Watch your feet!
Careful! Watch his hand.	Watch his hand
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea!	It will be very dramatic.
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.	To be deaf?	"Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE! AWFUL!""'"
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.	Yes, like a cave.	Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.	... without a shred of manners.
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?	Like it were a piano?	It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.	No sound at all?	No, it was a table.	Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.	There is something to be said for silence	Oh indeed. Cotton'.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.	Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.	That is good, yes.
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.	Baines is packing up?	Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him ... we have had some tears
My REAL father was a famous German composer	Ohh the tag is broken.	.... They met when my mother was an opera singer... in Luxemburg...
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.	Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.	And where did they get married?
Which mountains are those dear?	The Alps.	Ohhh I've never been there.	Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.	Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
Well, that is a strong opinion.	Yes, it's unholy.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.	No, no bible readers.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?	She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.	You have spare wife here Peini. You get rnana for that. Our chief four wives.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.	I'll be back.
I worry for you.	No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.	I miss you.
She looks tired.	She's stunted, that's one thing.
What's he say?	Someone died here. It's tapu.	But we came down this way didn't we? I'm sure we did.
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?	No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?	On your property?	Yes
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?	I'd like to make a swap.	What for?	The piano.	The piano on the beach? Ada's piano?
You'd have to organise it up here.	Yes, I thought that.	Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.	I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.	Yes, I suppose you would.
T-w~e-l-v~e.	Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
Yes, why not.	Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.	Nothing just yet
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...	I don't want to learn.	You don't want to learn.	No.	And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.	No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.	Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.	It was more to your wife that I gave it.	Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?	You mean in signs?	No, words. You have never heard words?	No, not words.
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.	Spoken words?	No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.	What are they?
Please take us to the beach where we landed.	I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
You have to wash them.	They are washed.
Wash them again.	The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
She wants to see what you can do.	I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.	Everyone has to practice.	I just want to listen.
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!	What happened?
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?	He chopped it off	Jesus! I'll kill him! I'll kill him. What did she tell him?
What did she say?	She says, throw the piano overboard.	It's quite safe, they are managing...
What?	She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled	I have the key here, look, I'll have it mended...
What's in here then, lead?	It's my mother's piano.	A piano?
Oh no, it can't come now.	It must come.
She wants it to come.	Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
We can't leave the piano	Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
Hello, then.	Hello.
What on?	On your piano, that is the swap.
What does she say?	She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.	He wants to improve himself... and you will be able to play on it ...  Teach him to look after it.
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.	You've missed this bit.	She never gives him a turn.
And when is the next lesson?	Tomorrow.
He's given it to us.	Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.	What will I play?
Play a gig.	Do I know any gigs?	Play a song then
Mama.	Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
You the owner here?	That's right.	Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.	Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.	I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.	Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.	All right if I look around your lobby?	No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
Which way are the rooms?	Who told ya this guy was in here?	Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.	Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.	I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?	Right through there.  But I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
What are ya gonna do, call the cops?	I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall.
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.	What's the line on Visitation?	7 to 2.  That ain't bad.	He'll probably fall down.
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.	Billie.  You ready?
Yeh, go ahead.	At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
The wallet.  You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.	Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!	You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.	No, no cops!
You wanted by the law or somethin'?	Naw, it's okay.	You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.	Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'.	You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.	I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.	It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.	I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.	I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.	He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.	Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.	How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!	What makes you think you can trust him?  He didn't do shit.
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.	What do we do?	You got a bag or somethin?	No.	How 'bout a handkerchief?	Here.
Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know he was that loaded?	Hell no, I just cut into him.  I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes.
Twist!  When did you get back in town?	Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.	I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.	These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.	Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
Twist, you know this guy?	No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.	Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.	Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.	Don't worry about it, pal.
You're late.  Where you been?	I had some appointments.	How much did ya lose?	All of it.	In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.	I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.	You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.	What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.	No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.	You think my play is bad?	I think it's the best...
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.	What?	I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.	What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.	It's nothin' compared to what you could be makin' on the Big Con. You're wastin' your time workin' street marks.	Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you everything.  If you hadn't taught me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.	Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.	But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.	And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it.  A bigger fool than I was.  I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance to step out at the top.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?	Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.	You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?	I'm out, Johnny.	If that's the way you want it.	That's the way I want it.
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.	Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.	Then why ain't he dead?	They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.	Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.	He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.	He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house.  Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.	We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.	You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?	Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.	Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.	Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.	We cleared 22 here.	Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?	They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5 is Gary, and 20 in Cicero.  Looks like you're bringing up the rear, Granger.
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.	We'll be waitin'.
Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.	You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?	Wasn't no problem a mine.	He was a con man, wasn't he?	He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.	Shove off, Duff.
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.	Which way did he do, Eirie?	Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.	The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.	Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.	We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.	You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.	There's always a depression on.	If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.	I like griftin'.	You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...	I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?	Forget it.
I thought you blew all your money.	I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
What the hell you gonna do when Snyder rushes his finger right to Lonnegan?  You're committin' suicide, kid.	Aw Christ, it doesn't make no difference now.  If Snyder knows about it so does everybody else. He never gets anything first...Damn, there's no answer at Luther's.	Listen to me, Hooker.  What ever you do, don't go back to your place tonight, don't go anyplace you usually go, ya hear me?  Get outa town or somethin', but...
Doyle, can I see you a minute?	I'm busy, Floyd.	It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.	Which one?	Mottola.	You sure he didn't just pocket it?
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.	They workin' for anybody?	I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.	All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
We got word from Chicago.  They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.	What about the other one?	They're still looking for him.	Who's got the contract?	Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.	Hackers.	They staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed.  They figure maybe he skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em up?
Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy we called him.  Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along.  Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing.  You understand what I'm sayin'?	Yes sir.	Good lad.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.	You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.	I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.	What do ya want the others to get?	Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.	What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.	I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.	Got to.  Gondorff's ridin' the mark in from New York on the Century.
Been a while since I stocked a wire store.  Not many mobs playing that anymore.	All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.	All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.	C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.	You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?	Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.	Does J.J. know how to use this thing?	All he's gotta do is read.
Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.	You sober?	I can talk, can't I?
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.	Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.	He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?	Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.	You mean you blew it.	Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.	He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.	No, I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off.  Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?	I picked something up on the way.	Lonnegan after you, too?	I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.	You never do, kid.
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?	You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.	I wanna play for Lonnegan.	You know anything about him?	Yeh, he croaked Luther.  What else do I gotta know.
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.	And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.	I'll take him anyway.	Why?	'Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him.
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.	We'll get by without 'em.	This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.	I never played for winos.	You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.	You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?	Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.	Then you'll do it?	If I can find a mob that'll risk it. But no matter what happens, I don't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it's not enough... cause it's all you got.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.	Neither are we.
He's waitin' for you in the card room.	Let him wait.
You just worry about your end, kid.	If we ever get to it.
How'd ya do?	Well we got some workin' money anyway.
Everything go all right?	Yeh, it was easy.
No signs of trouble?	What do ya mean?	You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.	No, not a thing.
How 'bout Lonnegan?	I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.	And?	He threatened to kill me.	Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.
Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.	Did he hold you up on anything?
You think he'll show?	Did he say he wouldn't?	No.	He'll show.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?	I thought I'd lost him.
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?	Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.	Then why'd ya move outa your room?	It was too noisy.	You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?	All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.	You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.	A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.	Christ, they'll probably miss you and hit me.
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.	Just a little nervous, that's all.	Luther always told me to bite my toenails when I get nervous.  You see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it.
Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.	How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?	Two or three hundred I guess. Sometimes played two a day when I was in Shea's mob.  We had it down to a business.  'Course Chicago was a right town then.  The fix was in.  The dicks took their end without a beef.  All the Wall Street boys wanted to make investments for us.  Even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat the game.  Yeh, kid, it really stunk.  No sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same as bein' a citizen.
I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.	Then why you doin' it?	Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.
Henry.	Yeh.	I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.	Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
You beat him, kid.	You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.	You wanta wait for your share?	Naw, I'd just blow it.
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.	Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.	The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.	Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
We'll use the wire.  Never known a gambler who wouldn't like to beat the ponies.	The wire is ten years outa date.	That's why he won't know it.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.	I also gotta win.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?	Not enough to cover a bet that big.	Get a couple extra guys in the line, then.  We'll give him the shut-out.
Looks like he's sulking.	If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
What's the problem?	He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.	Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
I'm not sure I know it.	We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
You in?	Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?	He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.	Nice work, J.J.
Look at that.  He's got four apes with him.	That's what I like about these guys, J.J... They always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em.
How ya doin'?	Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.	Lonnegan.
Raise 500.	See ya and raise three.	See and raise five.	Five and call.
Raise 300.	Pass.
Raise 1,000.	Raise 500.
See and raise 1,000.	Raise 5,000.
I guess I left it in my room.	What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money.
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.	The name is Lonnegan.	Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.	If ya win it could make ya, too.	What are the odds on Syphon?
A half mill on an eight to one shot. You're dumber than I thought, Lonnegan.	You're more gutless than I thought.
She coulda killed me last night.	Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.	Who are you?	Gondorff asked me to look after ya.	How do I know you're tellin' the truth.	Don't have much choice, do ya?
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?	You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.	Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.	You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.	Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.	I'll square it with the fixer.	Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya.
My end was only one.	Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.	What for?  I haven't done anything.	We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?	Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?	But I got a train to make.	It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.	But what about all these other people?	We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.
I'm sorry, really I am, but my train leaves in ten minutes.	All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.	Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.	Think nothin' of it.
You done?	Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.	It isn't any better.	Where's June today?	She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.	Where you goin'?	I don't know.  Depends what train I get on.
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.	Sixty-five.
What time you get off work here?	2:00 A.M.	You doin' anything tonight?	Yeh, sleepin'.
You got a back door to this place?	No.  What's wrong with the front?	Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?	No.	All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.	What the hell for?	Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake.
What does this guy want?	He'd like to kill me.
Looks like he missed ya.	Yeh, this time anyway.
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.	You move right along, don't ya.	I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.	And you expect me to come over, just like that.	If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.
I don't even know you.	You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
You sure it'll be one of these two?	No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.	All right, when?	Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.	Okay, Tootsie.
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.	What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.	I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.	Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
Hooker!	How ya doin', Jimmy.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.	Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.	You gonna have a go here?  How 'bout a ten spot on the line here.  The 4-9 been lookin' good today.  Lotsa action on 28th Street down there, too.  Pay ya 10-1.
You sure you wanna start off that big?  Bet like that could put a real dent in us.	I feel lucky tonight.	Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...	Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?	He cheats.
He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.	Yeh, he knows that.	What do you mean?	He hired a dame to take it from ya.
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.	I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.	So could Shaw.	Then why the rat?	Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger.  I want you to help me break him.
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?	Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.	All right, then.
Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa enemies to choose from.	I need somebody respectable...but not completely legit.  What I'm gonna do isn't very legal.	I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.	All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.	That's worth fifteen grand to ya?	Maybe a couple million.
You're dreamin', kid.	660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.	If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.
You should always look to the back too, kid.	I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.	Get on with it then.	Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.	You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.	This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.	And you were gonna pay me back?	I am after this race.
You really picked a winner, kid.	Give 'em a little time.
Well, what did I tell ya?	You're a lucky man, all right.	Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.	Why don't ya then.	'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.	You got a system, Carver?
You stayin' in or not?	I'm in.	It's foolproof.  We got a partner downtown runs the central office of the Western Union.  Race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies.  All he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner.  Then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that's already been run.  It can't miss, unless the Western Union Dicks get onto it.
You got the 400 grand yet?	Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.	I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.	What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?	If your system's as foolproof as you say, you'll get even more.
I gotta talk to me partner first. We can't afford to expose our game too much.	Let me talk to him.	No.	You want your money back?  Try and get it in a court of law.  C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll make it worth your while.  Migth even help ya finance the big play if this one works out.
What happened to your face?	Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.	He's right, Les.
What happened?	I didn't get the bet down in time.	Oh, Jesus.
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.	How am I gonna do that?	I don't know, figure something out.
You want a drink or something?	No.	We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.	Don't think I know him.	Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.	Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
You got nothin' on me.	We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.	No.
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?	I'll make parole.	Like hell.  You won't even get a review till you're seventy.  And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later.
Will you wait until the chump is played?	Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.	I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.	All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.	Just as long as I get to finish the play.
Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.	I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.	But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.	I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.	On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.	If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.	We were getting 50 from our guy.	With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow and he doesn't come up with the money.  We risk our whole operation for nothing.  I'll say when we make our bets.	Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.	On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?	We missed him.	You weren't hired to miss him.	There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.	Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?	I don't know.  He took it hard.	All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?	For fifteen years.	I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?	Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.	This is the last time I expect to see you down here.	Never heard of the place.
What is this?  I got work to do.	Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
Do ya know him or don't ya?	Yeh, but I don't know where he is.	Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?	Sure.  Every bunco man in the country knows Gondorff.	There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.	Why don't you pick him up yourself?	Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.	Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.	Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.	What the hell good is Hooker to ya?	He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.	He'll never do it.	I think he will.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.	Come on, gimme a break.	I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?	No.
What about this Rosebreen?	Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
What's your next step, Nick?	Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.	We'll see you before you go.
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.	He was?	Yes.  He admitted it.	Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.	Why not?	You know how they are... sex...	Then just say he was sixty years old.	Is that what it means?	Of course.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.	Look -- those are the first metals that came through.
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.	Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.	Oh.  I'll do my own typing!
Cheer up, darling.	I'm sorry.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?	It's all right.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.	But tonight is Christmas Eve!	He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.	He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?	Just a minute...
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.	I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
Any luck?	He's just around the corner.
She's got me worrying, too.	Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.	Why did that man want to kill him?	Said he stole his invention.	Do you suppose.....  ?
What?	Nothing.	You better take a drink.
How are you?	Another young man.	It's the same one.
Well!	That is, if it's all right with you.	And if it isn't?
Mind if I look around?	Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman...
Oh, Andy.	Don't cry.	I can't help it.  You don't know.....	Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.	I can't.	You've got to get your mind off this.	You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.	Go!	And don't ever try to see me again.	What are you talking about?	Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.	Do you think I care	You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.	I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --	I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!	Dorothy!	How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.	You're talking like a crazy person,	Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.	Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.	Go away!
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?	You're high enough.	Why not?
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?	Oh, Andy, Andy!
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?	Give it to me.	Oh, here she is.
What is it? Has he found him?	Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
What is it?	Nothing.
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?	He's all right.  Isn't that enough?	No.	You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.	That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?	I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.	I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.	Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?	Shush!
Don't.  It's horrible.	Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
You took that money from Julia's hand.	I didn't.	Then what are you hiding?	It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.	You hand that over to the police.	I'll do nothing of the sort.	All right, then.  I'll tell them.	I don't think you will.  It's your father's.	I don't believe it! You're lying!	There!
Oh!	Now do you believe me!
Mother!	And I'll give then proof!
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.	Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
Is your father still in there?	He's waiting for you.	Did he tell you where he was going?	He wouldn't say.	Tch-tch-tch --  Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant.  You wouldn't drive slowly, so you don't get a tip.
He didn't do it -- Nick!	What do you mean?
Another Martini --	Hello, there!
You know, we know each other.	Of course we do! We've been friends for years.	Aren't you Nick Charles?	Yes.	You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
Not that scrawny little....?	Yes.	How did you ever remember me?	was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?	Probably not.
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.	Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?	That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!	Disappeared!
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.	Macaulay.	That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.	tried him once -	Why don't you try him again?
Your father?	No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.	We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?	Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.	Oh, thank heaven.
Come on in.	I've got to see you alone!
You heard about Julia Wolf?	Yes.	There.	What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?	Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.	Where did you hit her?	Why... in the heart.	Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?	She fell down.	Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?	I don't know.	Which way did she fall?	She... she fell over backwards.	Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
Where did you get this gun?	I bought it in a pawn shop.	Don't lie to me.	That's the truth.
Hello, Dorothy.	Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder -
Dead?	He's been dead for three months.
It's been the same one for three months.	Forgive me.  How are you?	Take a good look at him, Dad.  Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
He'll still be your son-in-law!	You see how much we have to say.	Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.	Yes, she would.	I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.	What would your mother say to that?	This is my wedding.	Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?	He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?	If you think it'll be all right.
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.	Where are you going?	It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.	A new invention?	Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.	We were planning to be married right after Christmas.	Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.	It's a promise?	That's one thing I won't forget.  Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting.
How's your brother?	He's all right.
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?	You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.	I know -- I know --	You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?	And he still wants to marry me!	He's a brave man.
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?	Only in bad weather.	But it isn't bad weather now.	Better get home before it is.	Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.	Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
You can take that out to the car.	Going to run him through the fluoroscope?	Yes.	Do you mind if I come down and see it?	Not at all.	I'm very interested in that body.
Shrapnel!	Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.	Yes... yes.
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?	He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.	That woman!	She could tell you where father is.
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?	Not a thing.	Was there much blood?
Did you kill her?	Gilbert!	Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.	I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?	Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...	What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!	know.  But I saw him -
How'd you people happen to pop in?	We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.	Yes.  I might not have been shot.	We were looking for this bird.
I never saw him before.	What's he want of you?	Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.	What's that to you?	Nothing.	What'd he think it was to you?	Ask him.  I don't know.	I'm asking you.	Keep on asking.
Not without a warrant.	So you say -  Go on, Bob.
Have you got a pistol permit?	No.	Ever heard of the Sullivan Act?
This gun yours?	No.	Who's is it?	I'll have to try to remember.	Okay.  There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better.  Come on.
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.	You mean about that gun?	That ain't a gun any more.  The firing pin's busted - the -  Don't waste time talking about that.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?	Man to man, I'm not.
So would I.	It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
What about the suicide?	Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.	I thought it might be.  From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
You've been there?	Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
No proof?	Nothing yet to cinch it.	Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.	What do you mean?	For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.	Who's your candidate?	I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?	They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.	What about Jorgensen?	I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
What about this Nunheim?	Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.	Did you know he was hanging around Julia?	No.	He's holding out on you.	Let's go and see.  Taxi!
Well, what'd you think?	I think we're on the right track.	Who're you calling?	I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.	Trail him!  Trail who?	Nunheim!
Get anything?	She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.	Fifty will still get you a hundred.	This is enough for me.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.	Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.	Extraordinarily lucky.
"""D.W.R.""  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?"	Rosebreen.	Could this be him?	I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.	He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.	Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...	Just the same, Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he?  How long should you say this body'd been here, Doc?
What're you doing here?	I'll take care of him.
Are you kidding?	No.	Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?	Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
You mean that body-----?	--was Wynant's.
Shut up.	You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?	Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.	Seen any signs of it, Bill?
I said he hadn't written me.	Oh, then you did hear from him?	Well....	Well, what?	He telephoned me today.	He did!	I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.	When was that?	About three.	Did you go?	Yes.  But he didn't show up.
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....	Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?	I didn't know they had a fight.	Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
There are a few things we want to check up on.	I see.	You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?	Why yes.	Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?	No.	Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?	I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.	The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.	Goodbye.	Goodbye.
You did!	That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
What kind of clothes was he wearing?	A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.	Tell 'em.
That's ridiculous.	Let him have his say out.
Good morning --	Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
But he's interested!	I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
Do you think that Wynant did it?	Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
I think we may as well sit down.	I guess all the suspects are here.
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.	They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.	You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.
Have a shot?	What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?	That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.	Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.	That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.	Want to take a poke at him?	I didn't mean you, Mister.
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?	You don't think I had anything to do with it?	Where were you?
Where were you?	Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!	Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.	How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?	Just give me a minute....  I'll remember. I'm not stalling, Lieutenant.  You know I always come clean with you.  Gee, it'd serve me right if you had pinched me...  that's the afternoon I was.... wait, I'll show you...!
Don't mind what she says, Chris.	How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.	I'll get some.	You've said that for weeks.	I know.	Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.	Chris!	All right.  All right.	I couldn't go near that woman.	I said all right!
What are you going to do?	Just what I said I'd do.	You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!	Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.	Chris -- Chris -- !
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.	I thought you said you weren't going there.	Why, you said...	Never mind.
We're just having a little drink.	So I see.
Who's that man?	He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.	I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.	This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.	I don't like him.	Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?	No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.	What bonds?	The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.	Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.	I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.	Don't you remember....	Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!	Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....	No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?	What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....	That's my business.	supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.	Go ahead!	They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....	Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?	I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...	You're going to return every cent of it!	I can't! I haven't got it!	What did you do with the rest?	I never had it.	Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.	Yes?
Oh, hello.  Come on in.	"Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very ""Merry Christmas"" for you."	Oh, he's sitting up.	Good.
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.	That's all right.
I got word from Wynant this morning...	So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
Oh, please, Nick.	Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
Did you get my money?	I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.	I'm not telling anyone.	But suppose some business comes up...	That's just why I'm going.
One hundred...  two hundred... three...	Never mind.	I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.	I trust you.	Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?	No.	Well, let me do that for you.	You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
Thanks, and goodbye.	What'll I do if something comes up?	Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?	Is Julia going with you?	No.
But what if you need more money?	I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
How are you?	Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.	Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....	That's all right.  What are you drinking?
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?	Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?	She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.	I haven't been a detective for four years.	You don't say --	My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.	I see.  I see.	What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?	You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.	No word at all?	He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money...  I give it to her and she gives it to him.
My wife.	How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,	S'long.
How are you?	I hate to bother you when you're laid up.	That's all right.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?	Slim.
It might.	He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.	It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.	Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?	Hello....  Where?  In Allentown.  Yes... When is the next train? Right - I'll get that.  Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him.  I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it?  That looks like an admission of guilt.  And I had such hopes.  I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him.  I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that....  Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now.  I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
But it must have been Wynant.  I should have known if it weren't his voice.	Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
I have no right to answer that.	What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
Oh, Nick... Nick!	Hello, Mimi.	want to talk to you about something very important.
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.	What do you think?	Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.	Well, don't you?	You're always teasing.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?	Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.	But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.	I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...	Dorothy!  Is she here?	Yes...
Where's Gilbert?	Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --	You should have told them he'd disappeared.
But he has nothing to do with it!	That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
I tell you -- he didn't do it.	They'll want more than your word for that.	All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
This is all very pleasant but why are here?	I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
You did... where?	Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.	Oh, did he?  What did he say?	He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.	So I did.  I saw him lying buried in his shop.
Perfectly absurd.	And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
Nobody told me.  I did see him!	What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?	It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.	You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.	I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted -	Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
I gotta talk to you.  I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?	Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
I've never heard about you.	I didn't knock Julia off.	All right - you didn't.	I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.	Why tell me?	I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.	That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.	"Listen.  ""Studsy"" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they...."	How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.	He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?	I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.	That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.	I am on the level. If I knew anything I'd....
What's that?	This is your party.
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?	She don't say she is, but I figure she is -	Why do you say that?	Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -	Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
What am I?  The fall guy?	I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?
So it's you he was after!	Hello, baby.	He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.	I had him out this morning.	I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --	Oh, this is Andy --
You might have mentioned me first.	He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.	As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --
Pretty girl.	If you like 'em like that.	You got types?	Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.	Who is she?	I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.	By the way, how is your father's side?	Much better, thanks.	How many drinks have you had?	Six Martinis.	Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
What hit me?	That last Martini.
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.	Take it easy.
Who's that?	Santa Claus.
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.	We need ice.
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?	I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.	Room service, please -
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --	I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.
Isn't that my drink?	What are you drinking?	Rye.
Where did you get that?	She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.	What are you going to do with it?	Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
She didn't tell me a thing.	Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?	Yes.	Good. I want to talk to you.	That's jolly.	Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?	Can't you get to sleep?	No.	Maybe a drink would help you.	No thanks.	Maybe it would if I took it.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.	They were kidding you.	I'd like to see you work.	Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.	There's nothing I can do to help her.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?	Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.	I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.	At breakfast.
But it's Christmas now.	Breakfast.	What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.	You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,	That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.	All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
It's all right.  It just grazed me.	Someone get a doctor.	There's one coming.	Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?	Sure -- I don't even feel it.	I'll get some towels.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.	Want a drink?	Yeah.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?	He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
You're a fine watch dog.	He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.	On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!	Well, didn't you?
I never saw that before.	No.  It's a Christmas present.	Who gave it to you?	You did.	You must admit I have good taste.
Finished with these?	Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.	That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
Hello... send him up.	Who's that?	Macaulay.
Aren't you hot in that?	I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.	Is that another Christmas present?	Yes.	Did I give it to you?	Yes.
"Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  ""Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay""."	Let's see.  Where's it from?	Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?	I don't know.	He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.	Your guess is as good as mine.	Oh take it!  Please take it!
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.	Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!	It's not going to hurt me to get up.	Sit down!	You talk as if I were Asta.	All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.
What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.	What's the matter with you?	The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.	Maybe I will.	But Wynant --- ?	I don't believe he did it.	Why don't you?	No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.	So am I.	Come on, Watson, we're going places.
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.	Catch me letting you go alone!
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?	I'm going to take Asta for a walk.	He's just been for a walk.	We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?	Looks like a hold-up!	What are you going to do?	I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.	Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.	He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.	You mean, he might be hiding there?	I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.	Nick - I won't have you going down there.	Say you're the one who got me in this!	I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.	I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.	Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.	You wouldn't be a widow long.	You bet I wouldn't.	Not with all your money!	You dog!	Goodbye, darling.	Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?	Sure I will.	Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.	Why, I believe the little woman cares.	I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all --  If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
Back to California	My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.	I want you to stay and find Wynant.	I did find him!	What do you mean?	He was down in the shop.	Nick!	It was his body that was buried there.	Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.	That's a fact.	Wynant's body?	Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?	But they all said it was Rosebreen's.	That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.	What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?	Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.	Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?	Huh?	What things made you so sure?	Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.	Well, don't they?	Sure.
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.	I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
How long has he been dead?	Couple of months anyway.	Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.	Smart gal.	Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?	No.  Nobody but you.
I'm going to tell her.	Hey... hey.  Don't do that.	But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...	I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.	Why not?	I want to lie low till I get the whole dope.  I don't want to go off half-cocked.	What are you going to do?	I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?	Yes!	Got a nice evening dress?	Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?	Got a nice evening dress?	I've got a lulu -- why?	I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.	The suspects!  They won't come.	Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations.	Who do you think did it?	Mimi...	Mimi!	Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner.....
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.	Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?	Yes.	I wish you'd tell me who.	I wish you'd tell me.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.	I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
You're going to drive me crazy!	Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.	After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
Is that true?	I don't know.	Why are you saying it?	It's the only way it makes sense.	I hope you're well.	His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?	No, Mr. Charles.	How did you get in here?	I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.	You worked here?	Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.	Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?	That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.	Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?	Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.	Trying to put it off on her?	Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -	You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.	Police!
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?	No... no.
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.	You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
Nick Charles here?	Yes.  Nick!	You his wife?	Yes.	He's a good guy.  He sent me up the river once.  Hey, Nick!
Was he a good detective?	I wouldn't know.  That time he caught me was a accident.  I led with my right.
Well, congratulations.	I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?	Bonds, sir?	I know I left them there.	Maybe Miss Wolf has them.	Maybe she has.	You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.	Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right --
I'm sorry...  but...	Two weeks work gone for nothing.	I just wanted to tell you...	I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
Where are you going?	Home!	Home?	I'm fired.	Who fired you?	You did.
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?	Y-yes.
Where were you going?	Baghdad.	What's in the other direction?	This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.	Turn the car around.	Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.	Nobody's going to hurt you.
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?	Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone.  It's considered offensive.	You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat.
Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.	I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.	Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
Paper.	It's a fortune box.
What's it say?	Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.	There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
A casual one.	Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.	Better grab up some sand to take home to your family.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?	I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.	Oh, God.
What?	I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.	I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.	No, please, not again.
What are we going to do!?	We're going to keep driving.
They stopped.	Wha...	Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
They shouldn't have been here.	We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!	This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.	Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.	They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
What are you doing.	Low on gas.  Got to refill.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.	Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.	Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.	He's not so--	He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.	How tough you have to be to make the army?  All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.
What kind of mine?	I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.	Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.	Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
We've got rope?	For climbing.	Break it out.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.	You just go when I say go.	Should have at least gotten the map off of him.  Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
Ready?	Yeah.
All right.  Let's get out of here.	The soldiers are going to kill those people!
There's nothing we can do.	We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.	We can't just go off and--	There's nothing we can do.  We shouldn't even be here in the first place.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.	And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.	We're not going to find anything standing here.  Let's get to climbing.
Not much of a pass.	Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.	Picks up again just on the other side.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.	Let me see the map.
Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.	What do you figure it to be?	Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.	Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
Where'd they go?	I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--	Weird they didn't chase us.
And they can't fly around out there forever.	So we wait.
Missile!	Move!
All right.  Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting.  Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see.	What am I supposed to do?	Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
Epps!	I heard!
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.	Ready when you are.
You ready?	All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.	What about the gold?	What about it?	Maybe we should split it up now.	We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.	What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
You're the one with all the ideas.	You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.	Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.	Maybe I do.	Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.
You got no reason to do that!	I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.	Then get up and do something about it.
Get off him.	He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.	Get off him!
What happened?	I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
Stop it!	I told you; don't push me around.
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.	Why'd he come in our camp.
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.	How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.	He...he could have been watching us.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.	Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...	You said he was a deserter.	That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.	You don't know that.	You don't know he isn't.
You're out of your mind.	He's an enemy soldier.	I'm not going to let you kill him.	We're at war.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--	He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.	I've got no stomach for murder.	It's a combat action.	It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.	Then step aside.	No.	Get out of my way.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.	I out rank you, that's why.	In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...	What if I do?
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.	Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.	Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.	And let me guess who is.
I'm the one's got the big stick.	Suppose I don't go for that?	Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.	What about Jaeger?	Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.	We thought--
Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.	Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.	Wes--	Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
Thanks for taking care of this for me.	Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.	That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.	That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that.  It doesn't change me respecting you.  And now you let me down.  I expected more from you, you know?  I really did.  I expected you to--
They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.	You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
Just keep quiet.	I have to answer him.	So you can give us away?	If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
Give it to me!	If I give it to you, will you let us go?
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.	It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.	What are you doing?	What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- at-at--
At-at-at-at-at.	Knock it off!	Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.	Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?	I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.	No you're not.
You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.	Blow me.	Another month in this desert and I might just.
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.	Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.	There might be something in there.	Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.	There might be.
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?	Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?	I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place.
You all want to lay off?  God.  I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery.	OH MY GOD!
What!?  What!?	I did it!  I got the box open.
You think?	Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.	Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.	I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.	Wait.  Wait.
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.	Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.	Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?	Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.	What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--	We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.	But we all got to be in for this.  We all go, or we do nothing.
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.	We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
Now this is war.	Roger that.
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?	Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.	You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
Third.  What you're going to do with your third.	Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.	A car?  You're going to buy a car?
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?	What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?	Invest it.	Oh, that's fun.	It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.	And I'm talking about enjoying myself.	You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
Take the binoculars.	Wh-what do you think--	TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!	We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.	We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.
They'll shoot us!	We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.	They're not going to--	It's the only way.  We drive!
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.	Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
Steady it out!	I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
She okay?	Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.	Let's go.
What?	I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.	You can't tell anybody about this.	I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
It'd make their heads explode.	Millionaires, man.
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.	...I know.	And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?	I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
What do we do with the Humvee?	We leave it.
SAY IT!	I got that...sir.
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.	Faster we get there, faster we get back.	Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.	Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.	I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
What!?	Mine.
What?	Mine.  Land mine!
You didn't step on any mine.	I heard it click.	If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.	I heard it.
Oh, God!  Oh God!	Just be cool.	It's a mine, isn't it?	Just relax.	How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?	We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
Where you going?	Me and Wes are just going to talk.	Why you got to move away to talk!?	We're going to be right over here.	You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!	I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
There's a way.	Epps...
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.	Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
My leg is falling asleep.	It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.	I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.	It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
How's this going to work?	Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.	That's going to do it, right?  I'm going to be okay.
You're going to be fine.	You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.	Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
You're going to blow yourselves up.	Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.	You don't know that.  It could be a trick.	If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
This.  Whatever it is.	It's the treasure, that's what it is.
You're not losing trust, are you?	Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?	Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
I don't hear any--	Shut up and listen!
Don't!	It's a fire fight.	Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
Iraqis.  A bunch of them.	What are they doing here?
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.	What are they doing in the middle of nowhere?
They're doing more than slapping.	The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.	So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
X marks the spot.	Something like that.	But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.	I hope it means something, otherwise...
Where is it?  Where'd it go?	Stay low.	Where the hell is it!?	Just stay down.
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?	We're not going to do anything.	They're going to kill us!	They can't shoot us in here.
If they land--	If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
Think there might be more Iraqis?	Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
A whole lot of nothing.	So where do we start?
What are you doing?	What does it look like I'm doing?	It looks like you're not doing anything.	I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.	Get up and dig.	We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.	Get up off your ass and dig!
Must be a compartment.	I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.	It's giving.
It's just a mongoose.	Is it dead?	Yeah, Bwana, you got it.
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.	I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.	You don't have to imagine it.  Not anymore.  Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you.
Wait.	What?
What?	We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?	He's not going to leave us.	What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
Why do I have to stay down here?	Jesus, Jaeger.	I don't see how that plan's any better.	Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.	Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
What the hell took so long.	Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.	Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
Wes might be right about that.	It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
We should head Northeast.	Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.	There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.	It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.	You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?	We'll find our way.	How!?	We'll find our way!  We'll...
We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.	Forget Wes.	We can't just leave him.	Wes is dead!	What if he's not?	Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
No.	We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
No.	What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.	They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.	We'll lie.	They'll search the pack.
First Wes, now you?	I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.	And you; you've got it all together.	I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.	That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.	Is it all right if I stand up?
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.	Yeah.  Well, me too.	I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.	Sure.	Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.	You still got a map on you?	What?  Yeah.
Epps?	Yeah.	I don't want to die.	Makes two of us.	I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold.	It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.	I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to--
Sorry.	Damn.
What do you think our chances are?	If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
Wonder how the war's going?	It's got to be going better than this..
We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.	You sure you want me too?
I pick that way.	Okay.  Then we go this way.
Getting cold.	It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.	Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.	No!	Just let me rest for a second.	We've got to keep moving while there's still light.	You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.	Don't you touch it.	I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.	The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.	Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive.  He's gone.  Time for a new deal.
What do you figure it is?	Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.	Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?	Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.	Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.
Well?	Well, we should identify ourselves.	Yeah, I guess we should.
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.	Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.	Probably.
What did you say?	"I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means ""Don't shoot. We're your friends."""	They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on!
Oh, God...	They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.	What are we going to do?
Slip out your M-16.	And then what?	And then shoot them.	I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.	Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.
Can't you--	I don't have a weapon.
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!	I just said I would.  I don't think I--	Shoot them!
An Iraqi?	I don't know.  He didn't have a uniform on.  He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes.
What do we do?	We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
To where?	Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
What do we do?	We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
What do you make of them?	Shi'ites, I think.	Is that good, or bad?	I don't know.  They killed Wes.	Why haven't they killed us!?	I don't know!	...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.	With what?  Against how many?	We can't just sit here waiting to die.	You come up with a better plan, let me know.	Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
...Wes...?	You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
I didn't say that.  I never said--	Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
Can you ride a horse?	No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
Which way do we go!?	We go this way.
Damn it.  We lost the horses.	The...the gold...	It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.	When did you make the switch?	It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.	But...	We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.	What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...	You shouldn't think about things like that.  It'll just make you crazy.
Well?	A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.	How do we do that?	You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.	Why do I have to lie in the road?	Somebody has to.	Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?	Then I'm a rich man.
Epps.	Yeah.	I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.	Thanks.	This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...	Threatened to blow my brains out?	Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.	Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.
Epps?	What?	I'm thinking about taking a trip.	Thought you were going to buy a car.	Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?	I don't know.	I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?	How the hell should I know?
Australia.	What?	I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.	Really?	That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.
Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.	We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.	He'll slow down.
He's not slowing.	He's going to slow down.
Woods.	Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.	I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.	A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.	I could use some recon photos too.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?	Just...want to be ready when we do.	Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?	The photos.
Some good ones.	They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.	Saddam's got a boil on his ass?
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.	A headache?	Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.	I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.	Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.	Okay.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.	I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.	People are suffering.	People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people?	I'm saying don't do it accidently.	Oh yeah.  Accidently.
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.	It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.	I'm just trying to help you guys out.  It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?	I thought it would be good to know.
What does that mean?	Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.	"How do you say ""Come here, baby.  I'm horny.""  I can use that now."	Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
What is this?	Now you need me.	What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
He says it's a box.	Yeah, you're funny.	It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.	For real?  A treasure?
And you're the guy who's going to open it.	I could.
You get it yet?	Naw, nothing.	You will.  You'll get it.	I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.	You really think there's a treasure inside?	I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
Jaeger?	What?	You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.	Yeah.  So?	That's in two days.	Like I said; so?	They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--	What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?	We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.	It doesn't mean anything.	Why would they do all that if we weren't?
Jaeger?	What!?	You ever think about dying?	Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.	You ever think about it?  You ever worry?	The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over.  The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth.  Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box.  I've got a treasure to find.
At-at-at-at-at.	This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.	At-at-at-at-at.
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.	You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.	It's a container.  Break the seal.
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.	Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
We...we could go home with something else.	What?	With...with millions.  Millions of dollars.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.	It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--	You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--	It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--	It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.	It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.	So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase?  It's crazy.  Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.	You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.	You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.	Yes!
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.	Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
Epps, is that a sand dune.	Oh, no.
Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?	If!  If there's a treasure.	Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?	I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.	Yeah!  Gold!  How much?	How the hell should I know how much?
If there's gold.  If!	You know what I'm doing with my half?
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.	A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
Iraqis.	Oh, God!	Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.	Oh, Jesus!	They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here!
Yeah!  Yeah!	I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.	You see that?  Right by us.  They went right by.  You had them Epps; you called it.
I thought we were dead.	Yeah, well, we're not.	We got to get out of here.
We have to go back.	We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.	We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?	...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.	Then lets go back while we still can.	As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway.  We're not that far.  We can make it.
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.	You have to go with us, Wes.	Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?	You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...
Epps...	Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
How long we going to keep this up.	Until we're out of the mine field is how long.	Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.	That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.	You want to crawl, crawl.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.	Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.	Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?	Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
Is there anything you do know?	I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
So?	We have to do something.
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.	Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.	You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.	I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
Think we can make it?	We make it, or we go back empty handed.
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.	Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
What do you think?	Lines up with the map and the photos.
It's got a bottom.	Guess we know what the next stop is.
You down?	Yeah, we're down.	What do you see?
What the hell are you doing!?	I think we found something.
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.	He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.	He lived through that?
Maybe we should give him some water.	All last night he could have been--	I think he wants something to drink.	I'm not wasting my water on him.
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.	He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him.	You want to say some words?
You're going to burn up in those.	The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
Think the Iraqi's killed them all?	Probably shot a few.  Scattered the rest. Murderers.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?	We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.	You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
I can't hear him.	Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?	Stress category.	Correct.  Origin?	Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.	Violation?
Drug evasion with....	triple three, triple three! easy.....	Drug evasion with assorted perversions	Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?	Permant cortex bond.	Correct.
HUMMMM.....	What happened?	See if you can get a reading on tactal retention.  Try to estimate it without a meter reading.
Hurry up.	4732...?	Too low.
Control ON.	No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?	Vocasity	No, Tetanty.
I'm not hungry.	Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.	What's the matter with you?
What's this?  Why did you change it?	You've seen enough.	You know I don't feel well.	Eat your dinner.
What did you get?	I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.	When?	Now.	Now?	He wants me to come to his quarters.	A shift change should come through the scheduling office.
I don't know.	Don't go.	I have to... he's a G-34	You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.	No, don't make trouble.  It's nothing.
Then why did you bring it up?	I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
I haven't done anything.	Don't be so sure.
I've never been under the table before.	Look,dirt!	That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.	Looks like dirt.
Look, food!	That's not food.  Can't be food.	Looks like food.
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.	What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.	But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
What time is it?	What?	I said what time is it?  How long was I out?	It's 3+27 hundred	Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.	No!  Don't go.	They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.	Don't take anything.	I'll try.	Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?	No....I though  I'm afraid.	You're not cleared for this precinct.  Let's cross over first.
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?	What?	On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.	But...you...
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?	I don't want to lose you.
What are you doing?	I don't know.
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.	I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!	You don't know.  You don't....	If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....	I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.	Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.	We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.	Don't let them separate us.
Are you all right?	AH UGH.
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.	They don't know.	They're watching us now.	No one can see us now we're alone.
no...no, no.	Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.	It's the end.	I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.	It's wrong; so wrong, what we've done....
THX!	No!...No!...
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....	I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...	What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.	What?
Good Lord!	A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
There goes another of your disciples.	It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
I thought you were through with it!	We cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  You can work with us.  An organized plan of escape must be devised first.  Could you see anything?  You want to leave.  You're not like them.  You must have left something, or someone.
What's going on....what are you doing?	We're leaving.	What?	We're leaving.	Who?  Who's leaving?	THX and me.	But you can't.  We must escape.
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.	Impossible!
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.	I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
Wait!  I'll talk to him.	Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.	It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...	Incredible!
I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.	No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
How far did you go?  Was it cold?	You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
Well?	Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.	Not very encouraging.	On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
I've got it!  Astounding!	What?	No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  This world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still.
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled...	Where is LUH?	What?
Why did you have LUH come here?	Why are you so concerned?	What's going on?	I want you for my roommate.	Where's LUH?	It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..	We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?	You're in violation.	Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.	I don't feel well.
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!	You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.	I'll report you.  It's....	Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....	Get out of here, Leave me alone.
I'm leaving.	What?
I'm leaving.	When?.....How?	Right now.	But you can't...you.
What?	Look!
What are you doing here?	I was lost.	...and you're not lost now?	No, I...
Which way?	That way.
How do you know?	Look more closely.
We've lost SEN!	What?	Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.	Too late....stay close.
...it doesn't matter.  The rest of it just didn't happen.	What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.	Maternity ward, huhh!	We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?	Who?  Me?...I don't know.	What kind of answer is that?	I don't know.	You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.	Oh, That!  I'm 5555 SRT Entron..	I don't care.
What was that....	Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....	What have you done, Cut your hand?	"I'm all right THX rises and they begin to walk along the passageway. At the end of the hall is a small metal door, a sign read ""Level 842CON G, Division of Plastic, Vendable manufacturing stations"" the door is jammed and it is difficult to open.  Finally the latch snaps and the door swings open."
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.	All the insides are gone!
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....	No!....
I knew him.	Soon he'll be a plastic cube.	Shut up.
That's not it.	No?
She's not there	No......  She's dead THX........	You don't know that!	All right...
Remember this...?	Where's LUH?	Look more closely.
No...no you're wrong.	I'm only trying to help you.
I'm sorry.	What do you want?	Save yourself....
Just look at all those people.	I thought of something.....
Yes.	....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
Yes	I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
Yes.	My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....	Yes.	I can't understand.  The sedatives....
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....	You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
....with me?  What am I to her or she to me?  Nothing.  She's an ordinary roommate.  I..I share...	Yes...	...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...	Yes...	...to me.  I think I'm dying.
You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure.  Check cybernetic manual F-45.  If you do no have an F-45, you are in violation.  This is a double A restricted precinct. Remain where you are.  Authorities will arrive shortly.	You should know better than that!
May I help you?	I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.	They're not here.	Where are they?	And you are...?	Officer Reilly, vice.	There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-	-Where?	f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-	Thanks.
Hey, that's the guy-	We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
How's the print coming?	One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.	Damn.
Coffee, Mike?	No thanks, Bev.
Dispatch, this is Reilly.	Go ahead.	Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.	Aren't you on suspension?	Just do it.	Hang on.
Who the heck're you?	You the Bomb Squad?
Where did you get this?	Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.	What do you mean?
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.	Thanks.
Alright, let's check it out.	We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
What're you talking about?	When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.	We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?
What was-? Why...?	That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
What?	This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?	Now wait just a fucking-	Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.	Mike Reilly.
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.	"So you're the ""Device Squad""... and you defuse ""devices""?"	Treat. We treat devices.	Anything else I should know?	Don't push it, slick.
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?	She's not talking. But, she could be. So, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?	Only once, at Redstone.	Where...?
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?	Hey, look--	"No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us ""punks"" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did."	Oh yeah? Prove it.	Drive.
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.	Then let's go see what they missed.
So what were they doing here?	I don't know. You tell me?	An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.	You mentioned something called Redstone.	Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.	Cream of the crop, huh? You?	Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.	Sounds like terrorist heaven.	There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.	Just how easy is it to build a... device?	With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver?
Typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.	Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.	No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
This is where the van was parked.	Yep.	Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...	Look, it's a longshot...	Bingo!
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?	Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
How long are we going to stay?	`Til we get a better lead.
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?	What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.	Right.	Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
You guys seem pretty tight.	We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.	Why do you do it?	I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things...
So cut both.	One shuts it down, one turns arms it.	Which one's which?	I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
How long were you hooked?	What?	You don't have to talk about it.
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.	Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.	I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.	Your partner?	I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.
I terrible with mechanical things.	No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
It's working.	Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Ex-girlfriend?	Be right back.
What's up?	Where you guys at?	Driving in circles, waiting for-	Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.	How do you know?	Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.	Should we head for the Interstate?	Would you?	No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...	Me, too.
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.	You got it.
Fuck factor?	Off the scale.	What do we do?
Talk to me. Let's assess.	Right.
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!	He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
Good, now the other side.	Nothing.	Okay, let's go in.
Keep talking.	Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...	Don't touch that.
More metal... sharp edge...	Stay to your left.
Something round, two wires ...	That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...	What's wrong?	Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.	Make up your mind, trigger.
Yeah, another round thing.	Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.	Which one's which?	I don't know.	What... ?	When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.	How the hell do you feel yellow?	No excuses, just do it!
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?	Easy, guys.
What do you think?	Call upstairs, see what you can find out.	Right.	T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
Whadaya mean?	It's from an IRA.	Oh shit...
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.	"""Punks"", huh?"	Bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
You got it.	We work fast enough for you?
Political.	Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not.
Any word?	Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.	We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
Bev, you're the greatest...	Hey, I'm next.
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.	Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.	Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
C4, plastic explosive.	Helluva fuck factor.
Computer device?	Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
Glass, what is it?	I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.	Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
Lane oil...	A bowling alley.
What do ay say?	Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
Alright!	We've created a monster.
Jesus...	Reilly! He's loaded!
Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.	Who is he?	Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.	Taylor's dead.
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.	Thank you.	He's my brother...
Then why tell me?	People are dying.
You okay?	Alex-	I know. I warned them.
What is that?	Security.
What's the matter?	Nothing... just tired.
Why are we stopping here?	We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
No... No more killing.	Stay here.	Alex, please.	Stay in the truck.
Who are you calling, sis?	What? Nobody, I-
Alex, please-	Shut up!  Who is this?
Drop it.	Take him!
I want to work this.	You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.	But sir--
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.	Maybe she knows your old man.
What the hell was that?	A ticking bomb...
You touch me again and--	And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.	I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Prints?	Nothing so far.	What about the ballistics report?	Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.	We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
What the hell's going on?	Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-	Reilly, what're you doing here?
I'm filing charges against that mother-	Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
He is!	Look, it's important.
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...	What kind of bomb was it?
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match	Insurance?
How're you guys doing?	Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.	Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.	No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
Vice... Jesus.	That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
Pooch, can you move it?	I don't know...
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.	Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!	Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.	Shit. We're fucked.
Oh shit...	Fuck factor ten.
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.	Look who's talking, old man.	C'mon, it's a quiet night.
Next week we work the park.	I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.	You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.	Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.	You don't fish.	How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.	You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?	One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.	No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?	What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.	I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.	She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.	What was it this time?	She wanted to cook me breakfast.
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.	Nah, let's just take a look-see.
You okay?	Yeah, just a nick ...
Mike...	Don't talk.	Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
It don't work-	Ain't that a shit--
Reilly, Vice. I-	Quiet!
Make an appointment.	It's about this.
P.E.T.N ...	What?
Vice cop on a homicide?	Captain assigned me to assist you.
Device.	Huh?
A what?	IRA - instant retirement account.
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.	You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
T.J., what're you doing?	My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
So what're we looking for?	Someone who smokes French cigarettes.	In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.	He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Nice to be here.	That feeling won't last long.
Captain...	Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?	Sir, I--
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-	I'll do it.
What?	It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
I'll do it.	Goddamit, Reilly--	Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.	I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?	Yes, sir.
Sir...	I thought I told you--
What's this?	Report on the case so far.	You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.	Yes, sir.	But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
Yes, sir.	She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?	I didn't. But I had to try.
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-	My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?	Glass, you're to stand by with your team.	I promised her she'd be safe.	It's our only option.	It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...	Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-	I know.	You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?	Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.	Pull back. You're only an observer.
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-	We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?	So you lost a handbag, madame?	Yes.	And it had diamonds in the back.	Yes.	And diamonds in the front.	Yes.	Diamonds all over.	Well, have you found it?	No!  But let me tell you--any woman who spends a fortune in times like these for a handbag--phooey, phooey, phooey!
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.	Very well, Jacques.
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.	At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.	In a moment.
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.	Yes, M'sieu Laval?	Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute.
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.	Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going.	Yes, M'sieu Laval!
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.	Where did you find it?
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?	erect in sweater, arms folded.
No!	in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
Eleven o'clock!	A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
With the compliments of Colet and Company!	He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.	I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?	Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?	"I said, ""Come in."" And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, ""Good evening. I'm the doctor."" I said, ""Doctor?"" He said, ""Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."""
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.	No!	<u>Niente!</u>	That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.
What did you talk about?	About tonsils.	<u>Tonsili!</u>	"So I said to myself, ""All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that."" And then he said, ""Say ah."" And then I said, ""Ah."" And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone."
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.	I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...	Well--then it must be my mistake.  I beg your pardon.
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?	You see--  No, no! And <u>yet</u>--  <u>Did</u> I--did--now <u>where</u> could we have--
I wanted to say goodbye to you.	Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba.	But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?	No.	You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?	No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?	No.	Amsterdam?	No.	Constantinople?	No.	You've never been in Constantinople?	No!	But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?	Yes!	Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.	But--	I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--	And harems ... ?	<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
Good morning, Major.	Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
Nice day, Major.	Umm.	You're looking fine, Major.	Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.	Funny, the kind of men women fall for.	No color, no sparkle--but dependable.	The type they marry.	You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.	Nice suit.	Like it?	Smart. London, eh?	Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.	I thought so.
He's really not a bad fellow.	Just dull.	Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.	Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!	Doc--!
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?	Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.	Yes, Baron.	If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?	I would start with cocktails.	Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.	Yes, Baron.	And, waiter--you see that moon?	Yes, Baron.	I want to see that moon in the champagne.	Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.	I want to see--	Yes, Baron.	And as for you, waiter--	Yes, Baron?	I don't want to see you at all!	No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.	Thank you.
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.	But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?	You can trust me.	Yes, Baron. Thank you.
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.	Um-hum ...	You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.	Just a second.
I hope you find the figures correct.	I hope so, too.	M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--	For more than forty years. So Madame told me.	And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.	Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.	Two weeks and three days.	Um-hum!	Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?	No, not at all!	Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.	I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.	And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.	I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.	And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.	Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?	I am only insinuating that you are nervous.	Nervous! Why should I be nervous?	I don't <u>know</u>, M'sieu Giron!
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--	I've got to see you.	But not now.	Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.	It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--	No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.
Yes, m'sieu.	And you will be out by tomorrow morning.	Very well, m'sieu.	Otherwise I'll call the police	Yes, m'sieu.  M'sieu Giron!	What is it?	You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.	What do you mean?	You say I am a crook.	I know it!	Then why didn't you call the police? Why <u>don't</u> you call the police?  I'll tell you why--you crook, you.	M'sieu ...	Monescu.	M'sieu Monescu!	Just call me Gaston.
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.	Just as you say, Doctor.	Thank you, Major.	Good day, Doctor.	Good day, Major.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.	Now just a minute, Major--	No, Captain, I tell you--
Who?	The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!	The tennis player?	The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!	But you came. And you must forget everything--  except that you are here, Countess.
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?	No--no.	Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?	I would like to.	You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!	Why should you?	But she talks a lot. And before this night is over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.	You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.	Thank you!	Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.	Disappointed?	No--proud. Very proud!
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head.	Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?	Please.	Thank you.	The pepper, too?	No, thank you.	You're very welcome.  Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything ... And let me say this with love in my heart-- Countess, you are a thief.  The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket.  In fact, you tickled me.  But your embrace was so sweet ...
I like you, Baron.	I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
Thank you, Baron.	Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.	What time is it?
Darling!  Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you?	You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?	Monescu!	Gaston Monescu.	Gaston!
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...	Last year? It can't be that long.	Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace  and made it into a lamp for my night table?
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.	And take the twenty thousand francs ...	Right.	Sweetheart, what day is today?	The fourteenth of May.	And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--	The six--
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!	We'll take the Royal Suite!	Two fifty-three, five--	Seven and nine!	And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!	Darling!
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody.  Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.	And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!	No jewelry! Hands off jewelry! If we're broke--all right. I might pick up a million-franc necklace. But in times like <u>these</u> when we're doing a <u>cash</u> <u>business</u>--why take a chance on jewelry?
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!	What?	But it's not enough!
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.	Ah!	Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--	Certainly!	They're all right, aren't they?	Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!	Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!	Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.	Darling, remember you're Gaston Monescu. You're a crook. I want you as a crook. I love you as a crook. I worship you as a crook. Steal, swindle, rob--but don't become one of those useless, good-for-nothing gigolos!
Filiba ...	Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--	Five, seven, and nine--	Yes!  Now don't worry!
Éysée seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.	He recognized you!	No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you.	Spanish passports?	Correct. Now the train leaves--	At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!	Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.	Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?	I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late!	Well, see you at the Berlin Express.	By the way, how is your German?	<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!	<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.	<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.	<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.	<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.	What time is your rendezvous?	Now, Lily--	Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?	You <u>have</u> to get out of here!	That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--	Don't you <u>realize</u>--	Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?	Lily, you must listen to me.	Shut up! Don't make up any stories!	But, Lily--	Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
And you--	Lily--	Leave me alone! You were willing to sacrifice a hundred thousand francs for her.  Well--  she's worth it! [ You were willing to pay a hundred and twenty-five thousand for a <u>handbag</u>. You can pay a <u>hundred</u> thousand for him!]
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company!	Lily!
Yes...?	Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame?	That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!
You know the main staircase in the opera?	Yes.	Then you go to the left. There's a landing.	Yes.	Then you go into the foyer.	Yes.	And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.	I know that niche.	And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.	I remember.	You like that statue?	Not particularly.	Neither do I.  That's where I found it.	I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.	Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?	Of course it is! Are you doubting me?	Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.	Well--I am Madame Colet.	And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?	The pleasure is mine, madame.
One purse--  empty. One vanity case--	But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.	Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--	Oh! You didn't read it!	Naturally I did.	Oh!	You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.	M'sieu Laval!	But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.	What's wrong now?	With your skin, I prefer crimson.	Too much blue in crimson.	That's what you need!	No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--	What shade of powder do you use?	Peaches and cream.	That's too dark.	Do you realize I have light eyes?	But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...	In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.	Yes.	Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.	Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately.
Do you know my first name?	No. What is it? Tell me.
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?	What?	Make it out to cash!	As you like.
Eighteenth century.	Yes!	Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.	Right!	Beautiful specimen.	It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.	Oh?	This used to be my secretary's room.	I see.  She must have been very happy here.	Too happy. That's why I discharged her.	Isn't that wonderful!  You see, madame--
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?	You think that's too much?	No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.	That sounds sensible.
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--	Then I mislay my checkbook--	Then you use the wrong lipstick--	And how I handle my <u>money</u>!	It's disgraceful!	Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?	Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--	Ye-es?	And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.	What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?	The same thing.	You're hired!
Madame.	Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?	I'll be delighted.	And so will M'sieu Giron.
Yes, madame?	What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?	Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.	Um-hum ...	Then riding together.	Um-hum ...	Then lunch in the Bois--	Together.	Then a little nap--	How do you like my dress?	Beautiful.	Hair?	Marvelous.	Lipstick?
Crimson!	Correct!  Good night.	Good night.	Good night.	Goodbye.
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.	Talk? About me--about us?	Precisely.	Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?	No--yours, madame.	M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that!	You would?	Yes, I would!	Like that?	Like that!	I know all your tricks.	And you're going to fall for them.	So you think you can get me?	Any minute I want!	You're conceited--	But attractive--	<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--	<u>Shut</u> <u>up</u>--<u>kiss</u> <u>me</u>!  Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments!
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!	I <u>must</u> go.	I'm crazy about you!	I know it.	<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.	I <u>believe</u> you.	Then why do you want to go?	Because I want to make it tough for you.
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?	On the night table.	But I don't want to be a lady.
Ah, let me have a little fun.	Please!
Thirty-three--	No--thirty-five!
Yes, Gaston?	What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?	I wouldn't say anything--I would act.	Call the police?	Instantly.	Um-<u>hum</u> ...	But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
You look beautiful.	Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--	Mariette!	Yes, Gaston?	You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.	<u>Adolph</u>?	Adolph J. Giron.	And you expect me to believe that?	Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it.
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.	I don't believe it!	Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?	Giron...!	"Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, ""Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!"""
Goodbye...	Goodbye.	It could have been marvelous ...	Divine ...	Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.	But it could have been glorious.	Lovely.	Divine ... But that terrible policeman!	Goodbye ...
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...	Yes, Madame Colet?	Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?	Yes--uh--	Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.	What is it, madame?	I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.	No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.	No, m'sieu!	Yes, madame!	Well, the evening is still young. Let's go down to the living room and talk it over.  It's only ten o'clock.
But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?	I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to--	To M'sieu Laval?
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...	I know!	Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?	He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.	You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?	Jacques!
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.	Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.	Yes, that's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them and then they die.
Two lumps, madame?	Please!  Thank you.	May I?
Yes, madame?	You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!	About what?	Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.	Naturally not!
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?	Well--uh--yes and no.	To me he seems rather nervous.	Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!	No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--	So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--	Yes! And he would have a little more time for--	For all the really important things--	Right!	I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.	Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!	Very well, madame. Thank you.
Yes, madame?	How much is your salary?
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?	Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words!
I think you'd better go.	Ever had a romance with a crook?	I beg your pardon!	Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...	Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--	I don't want your money!
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.	He started it.	But you're the more intelligent one.	That's true.	Then why did you do it?	Because I hate him--because I love you!	You should have more self-control. You were in the army.	Well, he was in the navy.
Your bag?	Yes, my bag!	Didn't you take it with you?	Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?	No--I'm sorry.	But you saw it here.	Yes, I saw it--but--	Well, where is it?
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.	That's right.	Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.	The pumps --	The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder.
How much time?	An hour, two at most.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.	Thank you, Rose.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.	About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.	The ship will sink.	You're certain?	Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?	Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!	What? You have to get to a boat right away!	No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.	Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.	Bottom, left, right. I have it.	Hurry, Rose.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?	I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
Good luck to you, Rose.	And to you, Mr. Andrews.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.	Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.	I'm tryin' boss.
Who's the best? Say it.	You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
Shit.	You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.	Get that outta my face.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.	A hundred and one next month.	Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead.
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...	Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!	Lewis...
Holy shit.	Don't drop it Rose.	Rush her.	It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.	Don't you mean work me?	Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.	I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.	Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.  You see this? Right here?
What?	That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.	Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are.
The partners want to know how it's going?	How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
There's a satellite call for you.	Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.	No, trust me, you want to take this call.
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?	Rose Calvert.	...Mrs. Calvert?
I told you you wanted to take this call.	Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
None of the stewards have seen her.	This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
She's not on the starboard side either.	We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.	The one on the other side is letting men in.	Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
I make my own luck.	So do I.
We're too late.	There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
What could possible be funny?	I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.  Mind your step.	So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.	It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.	Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.	All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
You know I don't like that, Rose.	She knows.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.	There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
You told me to change.	I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.	I felt like black.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.	You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.	He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!	Cal, stop! It was an accident.	An accident?!	It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.	You wanted to see the propellers?
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?	Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
My God... Cal. Is it a --	Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --	The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
I had hoped you would come to me last night.	I was tired.	Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.	I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.	You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?	I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
Something serious has happened.	That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
But I was with him the whole time.	Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.	Not the better half.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?	I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.	Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
Is this in any way unclear?	What do I tell your mother?	Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
You're precious to me, Rose.	Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?	Sure. Count me in.	Good. Settled then.
This should be amusing.	Can I bum a cigarette?
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.	No caviar for me, thanks.  Never did like it much.
No thanks. I'm heading back.	Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.	I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.	Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.
You're a good liar.	Almost as good as you.	I always win, Jack. One way or another.  Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.	What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --	Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!	Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!	You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!  Capito?? I go to America!!
You know somebody?	Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
How you two doin'?	I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
The boats are all going.	We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.	Bollocks.	Well I can.
Cor... look at that, would ya.	They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.	Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.	Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.	Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.	We got room for lots more. I say we go back.	No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Now row!!
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!	Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.  Well come on!
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.	If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?	No, but we're making excellent time.	Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!	I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.	Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all.  Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?
Why have we stopped?	We've struck ice.	Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?	Excuse me.
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.	No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.	No you won't.	What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.	You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
You're distracting me. Go away.	I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.	Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.
The fall alone would kill you.	It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
How cold?	Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
Ever been to Wisconsin?	No.	Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --	I know what ice fishing is!	Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.	You're crazy.	That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
I'm Jack Dawson.	Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
HELP! HELP!!	I've got you. I won't let go.
Hello again.	Could I speak to you in private?	Uh, yes. Of course. After you.
So, you got a name by the way?	Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.	That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
Mr. Dawson, I --	Jack.	Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.	Well, here you are.	Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.	You're welcome. Rose.	Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?	That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.	I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!	Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.	Oh God, I am such an utter fool.	That penguin last night, is he one of them?	Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.	Is he your boyfriend?	Worse I'm afraid.
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.	Yes, exactly!	So don't marry him.	If only it were that simple.	It is that simple.	Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.	Well, I guess I will tonight.
What's this?	Just some sketches.	May I?
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.	Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!	Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
And these were drawn from life?	Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
You liked this woman. You used her several times.	She had beautiful hands.	I think you must have had a love affair with her...	No, no! Just with her hands.	You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.	I see you.
And...?	You wouldn'ta jumped.
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!	You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.	Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.	I'm sorry. Really... I am.	Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?	Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.	A whole ten cents?!	Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.	Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.	Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.	You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?	Sure. If you like.	I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.	They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.	Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
Jack, must you go?	Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
May I cut in, miss?	You're still my best girl, Cora.
I don't know the steps.	Just move with me. Don't think.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.	A mistake?	Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.	I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.	That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.	I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --	Jack, I --	No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.	I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.	It's not up to you to save me, Jack.	You're right. Only you can do that.	I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
Fabrizio said you might be up --	Sssshh. Come here.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?	Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.	Should I be expecting him anytime soon?	Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
What is it? A sapphire?	A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.	He does landscapes.
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.	He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...	Kinda like we're doin' right now -- uh oh!
Where to, Miss?	To the stars.
Are you nervous?	Au contraire, mon cher.
You're trembling.	It's okay. I'm alright.
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.	This is crazy.	I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.	Could it have damaged the ship?	It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.
It's bad.	We have to tell Mother and Cal.	Now it's worse.	Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?	Right.
This is horseshit.	Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!	He couldn't have.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.	I know, I know.	See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?	I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
You have to go for help.	I'll be right back.	I'll wait here.
Will this work?	We'll find out.
I'm not going without you.	Get in the boat, Rose.
You jump, I jump, right?	Right.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.	It's so cold.	I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
It's getting quiet.	Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.	I'm so cold.	You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?	I can't feel my body.	Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.	I promise.	Never let go.	I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.	Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.	It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.	Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.	Yes sir.	And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
April 14, 1912.	If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?	That's enough.
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.	What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.	Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.	You think she was really there?	Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
I'm sorry.	We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
Is your stateroom alright?	Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.	Would you like anything?	I should like to see my drawing.
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.	It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?	Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.	Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.  See the date?
It's been 84 years...	Just tell us what you can --	It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...	Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?	I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
Don't come any closer.	You had it the entire time?!
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --	Excuse me.
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.	Charmed, I'm sure.
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!	Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!	Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.	How can you put this on my shoulders?
Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?	It's so unfair.	Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
Rose, get in the boat!	Goodbye, mother.
Anya!	Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
Anya, I think you're crazy.	Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.	I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?	Do you want the truth, Anya?	It would be a nice change from you.	I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.	You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--	How'd you ever get away with it?	When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.	Sure!	I never want to go back....
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?	Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.	That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.	I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
Hope we're not intruding.	This is Miss Marsh.	Yes--I met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances.  What's the matter, Miss Marsh--aren't you feeling well?
Well--shall we go into dinner?	I'll join you later.	And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh--  --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.	I can explain--	Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?	Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.	Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?	You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?	Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.	I didn't ask you to come away with me--	Oh--a hundred times--	--and I can tell you where to get off.	And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!	Will you leave me alone?	I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?	Baloney!	No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--	I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
Feeling a little better, I see.	Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?	Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
Good afternoon--	Glad to see you again.
I hope so.	That's a date.
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.	We'll save you a place at our table.	Thanks.
Isn't she lovely?	Yes--and <U>very</U> popular--
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--	Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.	Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.	Sorry I can't return the compliment.	You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.	I don't understand.	I think you do.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.	Montana?	"Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--""Honest Jack""--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world."
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.	Isn't that interesting?
You'll excuse me.	Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
Will you pardon me?	<U>Gladly</U>.
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--	I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
Did you find it?	No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?	No-o!	Where's Lother?
Where'd you get it?	Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.	What did you want a gun for?	Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.	Is that why you killed Lee Lother?	Guess again, copper.	Get moving--
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.	We'll be expecting you.
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?	Not at all.
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.	If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink.
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three.	I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Aces full.	And me coming in with two pair--
You're coming back--	That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
How about a little game later?	Fine--I'll be glad to.
Could I see you a minute?	Sure!  Excuse me.
No gentleman would do that.	I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would--  --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.	Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.	I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage.
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.	"I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --""Honest Jack""! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets."
I'm so sorry!	Want to take it back?
I thought you were one of my friends.	I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>	Yes--are you?	I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.	She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful.	I'll say she is!	Nice lines--	Yes--
Like her paint job?	Very much--	You've got lipstick all over you.	I could stand some more--	--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.	No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
Where have you been hiding?	Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.	Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?	So you washed it off!	How about giving me another coat?	Good-by.	Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--	Good-by!	There's soft music--	--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.	Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.	You're not very ambitious, are you?	Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.	You work too fast for me, young man.	Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?	Never eat before the show.	Well--breakfast?  Lunch?
This is Mr.--er--	Brett is the name.	Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.	You <U>are</U> a lunatic!	Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.	Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.	Married?	Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?	I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.	What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?	Tell me.	A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--	--you want to adopt him!--Good for you!
Isn't she attractive?	Very--your mother?	Don't be a c-a-t.	You asked me to dine with you tonight.	Yes?	Well, I can't.	Don't rub it in.	But I'll have cocktails with you.	When?	At seven-thirty?	Sooner it you like.	Okay.	Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.	Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.	I'll be there--Good-by.
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.	You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.	I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering.
A little.	Sorry.	Thanks.	Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
Mighty decent of you, pal.	Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
What are you thinking?	A lot of things I'd like to forget.	That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental	I can't blame the ocean--it's you.	You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.	For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!	Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.	But--	--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.	Sally--!	Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.	You mean that?	Don't let's talk about it.	You said it! How about a little action?
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?	Yes--is it all right if I come like this?	This time I'm really glad you showed up.	Lonesome?	We'll let it go at that--
What, again?	Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--	What?--	I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?	I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.	You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--	You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--	I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?	I think we ought to walk.
Good night, Mrs. Brett!	Good night, idiot!
I could see you were pining away--	Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?	Yes--I remember--
How well do you know her?	Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.	Who with?	A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.	Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?	Lose?--I won a little--	That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--	What do you know about them?	Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--	You can live that down, can't you?	He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!	I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.	Come on--let's take a swim.
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.	Make it five.	Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.	I'll be waiting on deck.
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.	Jimmy!
Well, I'll be--!!!	What's the matter?
Not here--follow me around the shed.	Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?	Oh, putting on the swell, eh?	I thought you were a smart guy.	If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship.	We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?	We coulda got two third-class!	No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.	Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.	It'll never hurt you---Got any money?	A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!	No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.	I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents.
Nix, the law!	Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.	I'll watch for him, sir.
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.	Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--	Shortie, look!
You don't think--?	Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.	Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?	Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.	How're the tips?	A dollar forty.	I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.	Not a chance.	Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.	Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.	Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?	Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--	--there's thousands of 'em!	A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!
This is a business trip!	She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list.	Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?	Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?	No, sir?	My change.	Change?	A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
Shortie!--you know my motto?	Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.	Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.	Now you're talkin'!
Inspector McKinney.	Are you screwy?	I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.	You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.	You take some awful chances.	Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.	Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?	That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.	Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.	Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.	Thank you, sir.	I'll take one.
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.	What is it?	Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.	Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
About sixteen hundred.	Partners, ain't we?	Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred.
You keep it--	<U>Me</U>!	Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
Say--wait a minute!	See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?	Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?	Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.	Where did you hide it?	On the drunk.	Get it!
Come in!	Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.	Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?	Three Jacks.	That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
It's your deal.	It's a pleasure.
How's your mother feeling?	Much better--thank you--
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.	Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?	Why isn't that a good time to quit?
I thought you were a sucker--	Think again--
That goes two ways.	Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.	Oh, yes. On the pier.	Before that. Your face is very familiar.	Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?	No--not quite.
I'm going to the show--	I'll go with you--
Care to join us?	No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--	Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--	It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--	Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--	If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--	I wouldn't be surprised--
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?	No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--	Good night!
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.	Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap?
How about you?	No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.	You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.	Why?	Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?	Sure, I'll go.	I'll go with you.	Swell!
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.	How about trying your fine Italian hand?	This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.	Hey!--you're tickling me.	Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs-- like this--in case they got what you're looking for attached to a string.  See what I mean, Purser?
Hello, young fellow!	Coming to the pool for a swim?	Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.	It's a bet--come on, Sally!
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.	Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you--	Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
Don't get yourself all worked up--	You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?	Why, I--
Here's your fifty.	Thanks. That makes us square.
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.	Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.	Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.	O.K. Heads you win.
That's too bad.	I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.	I'm sorry to hear that.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.	Wait a minute--let's match for it.	Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?	No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--	She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.	I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?	I should say not.	Good!  At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.	She did?	Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?	Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.	O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.	What's that?	If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard--
Here you are, sir.	What'll I say?
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.	How?
Where do you live?	In New York.	Your wife knows that, don't she?	Sure.	Then you don't have to tell her--cut out New York.
"""Will be back in four weeks""--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!"	That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.	Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.	How?	"""Will--be--back--in--four--weeks."" You don't need the ""will be."" Just say ""Back in four weeks."""	That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
"Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  ""Back in four weeks."" Instead of ""in four weeks""--say ""next month""--That saves another word."	Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
"Just a minute--I don't think we need the word ""Back"" --Where <U>is</U> ""Back""?"	Back is in New York.	Your wife knows that, don't she?	Sure.	Cut it out.
"Now we get it down to two words--""next month."""	Send that.	Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?	Next month is June.	"Fine! Instead of saying ""next month""--we'll use one word and say ""June."""	June? That's my wife's name.	That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.	O.K.! Send that!	Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?	Sure.	Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!	Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
I'll say--how fast is this boat going?	Oh,--we're doing about thirty--	Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--	No. <U>Knots</U>!	What?	Knots!	I can see you're no gentleman--
That's me!	Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--	Yes--Me--in person!	So what?
I can see where I won't talk much to you.	<U>Nuts</U> to you too!
Hello, Denby!	I thought I put you to bed.	Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.	Well, did you find me?	Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?	This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.	That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?	She's in New York.
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.	That's fine.
Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.	Who won?	Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.	I was never stiffer in my life.	All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.	<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
Oh, there you are--	That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?	Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?	Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.	Never mind.
McKinney's the name.	Miss Marsh.
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?	Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--	Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.	Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--	It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.	He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--	It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!	Oh no--I don't want to impose on you--  It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it-
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.	Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.	I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?	Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?	Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.	Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.	Maybe he just travels in bad company.	Yeah--
I didn't--	He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?	Yes--but I didn't give it to him--	Is this your gun?	Yes!
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.	Are you happy?	Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
Am I a member of this club?	You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--	Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here.	Everything O.K.?	Just what the doctor ordered.
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.	Like it?	Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--	Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.	And you've put it over--haven't you?	Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--	You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?	No--not much--excepting--	Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?	No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.	I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--	Do what--	You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.	News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--	It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.	I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?	I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.	I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--	Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!	Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.	Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--	But not nice enough to marry--eh?	Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.	I'll never love anybody else.
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?	Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.	What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.	I don't get the humor of that remark.	<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
Yes.	Very serious?	Very--
Why--don't you like him?	Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.	What do you mean?	Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?	Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.	I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.	Meaning what?	You don't shoot squirrels.
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?	I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--	But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?	Somebody's got to do it--	Well, let's hear the poem--	Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--	Very good, Mary--	But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--	What's the matter, Mary?	I'm getting seasick--	H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--	Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?	Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!	Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?	I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?	All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?	When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?	Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
With your dry wit and humor--	Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--	Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.	What's he got that I haven't got?	Well, he has a straw hat--	So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.	--And he has sex appeal.	So what?	Get that out of your trunk.	All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!	Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.	Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
Is that one of the Who's Who?	"No--He's probably one of the ""Here's How.""  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--"
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!	Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?	Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--	Good-night, folks.
"Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--""Gee you're tight.""-- and the window says--""You loosen up a bit and so will I.""--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?"	Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--	Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?	No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
What happened to you?	You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?	What for?	Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.	Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.	Eh?... Oh.	"He works the boats as a ""come-on"" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself."	There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
That's him! That's the sucker!!	Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
Can you read 'em Jack?	They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds.	The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.	The country boy's about due.	Better unlock the door.  Sit up, darling, and be dignified.
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff.	Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
How much did you lose?	About twelve hundred.	I went for four.	It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.	You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.	I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.	It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.	Why don't you leave me alone?	Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?	I wish I could.	Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?	That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?	He's all right.	Thanks to me.	You leave the kid alone.	A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--	--you'd go with him!	Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
Not because of Ned.	Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?	You can't bluff me any more.
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?	Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.	--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?	That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
Don't, Lee--that's dead.	Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--	I've lost my taste for knickknacks--	Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?	Have you ever figured they might extradite you?	I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.	Not a chance--I'm through.
Yes, Yes!	You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?	No!	S'pose you've never thought of killing him--	I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--	Why?	Because I was yellow, I guess--
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--	This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!	Good night!
Congratulations.	Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?	He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?	"Say, ""Thanks very much!"""	I mean if you knew it were stolen.	Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.	And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?	Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.	Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
That's the truth--every single word!	I sincerely hope so--	Why should <U>I</U> kill him?	For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.	I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.	I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.	He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
There you are, sir.	Thank you.	Thirty one's and two ten's?
He's certainly good-natured.	"""Smooth's"" the word."	I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.	It all depends on what you're used to.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!	What's the matter?	Nothin--  --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.	Do you think Lother could have seen it?
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.	Sure, Sis.	Aren't the roses beautiful?
I'm all right.	You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?	I was in his cabin--	What!--are you crazy?	I'll explain later--	If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?	Telegrams.	Well--get a move on yer--then get back to yer station.
Nothin'.	Let me look at it.	Ain't got time.	Hey--you! Where you going?
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--	I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.	Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.	Then why did you run away?	Because you ran after me.
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?	500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Oh, for Christ's sake!	Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
God damn son of a...	Isn't that a daisy?	Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.	Now Ed, are we cross?
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.	Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say!  Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore?  You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
Oh, my God...	Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?	Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-	Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?	Gave all that up.  Going into business.	Well I'm the man to see.  Besides Sheriff I'm also tax collector, Captain of the Fire Brigade, and Chairman of the Non-partisan Anti- Chinese league.  A man of many Parts.  Got a place to stay yet?  I Also sit on the Townlot Commission.  Got a couple of Lovely cottages coming up for Rent.  Here, let me show you...
So how's Tombstone treating you?	Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.	Actually, you know, that's not a Bad idea, send a signal we're Growing up.
What d'you think of the singer?	Nice voice.	That's not what I meant.
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?	That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.	A peace officer... Impressive man	Yes, very.  And very married.	Oh, so that's it...
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.  Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next.  Who know?  You might find a Future here.	Maybe even my destiny.
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?	Absolutely nothing.
Listen, I want to talk to you.	Not now.  I don't have time.	I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.	My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.	You whore!  You filthy whore!
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.	I don't understand.	You will after tonight.  Bet on it.
He said to turn loose of him.	Well I'm not so go home.
Where'd you get that horse?	Beauty, ain't he?	I asked where you got him.	Where do you think?  I stole him.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.	Come and get him.	Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too.  Even stole a Horse once.  But you can't--
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.	"He was quoting the bible, Revelations: ""Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."""	Well now that's a little more Like it.
Shut up, Ike.	And you must be Doc Holliday.
I want them spitting blood!	Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!
There's no God, there's no devil, I hate the God damn world!  I want To die!	Easy, son.  You just need to get Your feet back under you, that's All.  Come on, boy, let's kick South.  Down to the old playground.
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.	Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
I'm retired.	Good.  That's real good.
Come on, you...	Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.	Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.	Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.	They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?	Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.	And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.	Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?	This brand.	We're gonna get along just fine.
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-	I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.	Well... 'bye.
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!	No...
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...	No...

But wait, you don't understand-	No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.	I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.	Already got a guilty conscience, Might as well have the money too.
That's the rumor.	You retired, too?	Not me.  I'm in my prime.	Yeah, you look it.	And you must be Ringo.  Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo.  The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say.  What do you Think, darling?  Should I hate him?
Age quod agis.	Credat Judaeus Apella.	Ecentus stultorum magister.	In pace requiescat.
That's just my game.	All right, lunger.  Have at it.
On three?  You call it.	Here it come: one-two-
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.	My fight's not with you, Holliday.	I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?	I was kidding about that.
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.	Say when.
Here, Doc.	Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.	I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
You don't even know him.	Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.	Enough?  Never.
What's wrong, Doc?	Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.
How you feeling, Doc?	Better.	That's good.  I knew it wasn't nothin'.
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.	What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?	Not exactly...	I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.	Yes, I know.  You are a good woman.
Doc!  How the hell are you?	Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
Since when is faro a business?	Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?	I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.	Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.	That's what I love about Wyatt. He can talk himself into anything.
Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday.	Forgive me if I don't shake hands.
Very cosmopolitan.	I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
Very instructive	But who was the Devil?
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.	And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?	Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.	"I see.  And what would you do if ""she"" walked in her right now? WYATT ""She""?"	You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.	I don't know.  Probably ignore her.	Ignore her?	I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.	I'll remember you said that.
Satisfied?	I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
He's drunk.	In vino veritas.
Maybe I ought to go out there.	You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
Wyatt!  Just in time.  Pull up a chair.	Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.	Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.	But Doc-	I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much	Sorry, sorry...
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.	Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!	No...
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?	I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
Doc...	Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!  Come on...
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?	A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.	So what does he want?	What does he want?  He wants revenge.	Revenge?  For what?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry.	That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.	Never got to wear one of those.
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.	How you feelin', Doc?	Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?	Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.	I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.	All right, Doc...	You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.	All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.	When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.	That's great coming from you.	I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.	Then what do I do?	First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.	All right.  Then what?	Run.  Take that girl and start Running.  Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By.  This time run and don't look Back and call it living.  Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt.  Live, Wyatt...  Live for me.
"Hey, is that ""Old Dog Tray""? Sounds like ""Old Dog Tray""."	What?	"You know, Stephen Foster.  ""Oh, Susanna"".  ""Camptown Races"", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!"	I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.	A which?	You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.	Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
Don't touch me!	Sorry...
You really look awful.	Not half as bad as I feel.	Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.	Wyatt Earp is my friend.	Hell, I got lot's of friends.	I don't.
I don't believe it.  He's clean!	What?  But I saw 'em-	I'm telling you, there isn't a Mark on him.
All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!	I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.	Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!	Awful lot of money.	Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.	You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.	Damn!  All right, wait a minute...
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!	What was that all about?
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-	I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it.	There's no reasoning with him.
No.	What?	No.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.	Good God, you're really-	Cards in spades.  I'm in love with Every second of her life.  Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust.
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.	Wyatt, are you crazy?	I made a promise.
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.	All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.	I know.  Me neither.
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.	Colorado's closer	So're the Cowboys.  They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us.
There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.	Yeah.  Or undertakers.
You know, we might just pull this off.	Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
Yeah, better run, you bastards!	How is he?
Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?	Never even heard of anything like it.
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.	He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
Praise Jesus!	I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-	It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
We've never actually met.  My Name's-	Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.	I know what it means.
What is it?	Easy now... That mare's in season.	Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?	They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.	I have a better idea, let's run It out of them!
That was lovely!	You know you almost got us both Killed back there?	Fun though, wasn't it?	You'd die for fun?	Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.	I laugh sometimes	Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?	Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.	You're a little touchy about it.	I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?	Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?	What about her?	Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?	Where do you get these questions?	Just answer.	I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.	Doesn't suit you.	How would you know?	Just doesn't, that's all.	Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?	Room service.
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.	You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?	Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.	The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.	Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.	Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
What's wrong?	I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.	I know, me too.  What should we do About it?
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.	Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.	Fortuitous even.
And I don't even know your full name.	Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.	And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.	Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.	I hate Sadie.	Well you'll always be Sadie to me.	Always?	Getting late.  We better get back.
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.	Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.	You feel bad about this?  About me?	I didn't mean it that way.	You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.	I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
No, no, get away, get away from me...	Wyatt...
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...	I forgave you the moment you said it.	You did.  Well... thank you.
I have to go.	Wait!
Wyatt!  My God...	Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
I have nothing left.  I have Nothing to give you.  I have no Pride, no dignity, no money.  I Don't even know how we'll make a Living.  But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.	Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.
What can I get you?	Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?	Milt Joyce, owner-operator.	Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.	Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?	Well sure, neighbor, easy to say.
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.	Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-	Mattie, they're here!  Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie.  Or even Mrs.  Earp if you Prefer.
Come up to the fire, honey.	I think I'll just lie down awhile
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.	They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.	You get lonely?
No, stay.  Please stay with me.	Honey, I gotta start makin' money.	Oh, all right.	Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.	No, no, I don't want to keep you.	No really, I can stay a while.	Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.	All right, well, good night.
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.	I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?	Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?	I don't know.  I'm all right.	Really?  You sure?	Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?	Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?	Just thinkin' out loud.  Forget it.
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.	Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
Mattie.  What about this?	I need it.	'Least you admit it.	Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.	Look, Mattie, I know you're-	You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
All right, look.  I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie.  I can, I swear.	Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you?  Right out loud so I can hear?  Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt?  Will you do that?
Well hello, Sherm.	You wanted to talk?	Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.	That what you got me up here for?	You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.	Forget it, Ringo.	Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?	'Least they don't scare women.	You're the boss.  One thing, though.
Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!	McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-	Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.	I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back	Well in that case, I saw your Horse.  Billy Clanton was takin' Him up to the Cut to show him Off.  The boys're all up there Right now, branding.  And in a Mood.  Still want your property Back, Mr. Private Citizen?
So what about you Cowboys anyway?	If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.	Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...	There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.	No?  Brothers to the bone, right?	Not anymore, not after this.

I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really.  Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God?  No, Come on, really, do you?	Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.	Well what do you think happens When you die?	Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.	I read this book, book on Spiritualism...
Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?	Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.	Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
It's that woman from the coach!	I'll be damned...
Hey Doc!  Come on now.	Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.	Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.	Yeah?	Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.	All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.	What're you talkin' about?
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.  Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go.	I know.  And nobody can make him.
How you doin', boy?	Fine.  Better.
You were right.  It's nothin' like I thought.  I almost wish...	I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.	I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
That thunder's sure somethin'.	That didn't sound like thunder.
Get down, boy.	Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?	What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.	Morg, use your head.	I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.	I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.	Listen to yourself, Wyatt.  Lie Down and crawl or you might get Hurt?  What kinda talk is that? That's Virgil lyin' over there, Wyatt.  Our own brother.  Ruined For life.  No sir, I ain't going No place.  You want to go, fine. I'm stayin' right here and have It out with those bastards.
I just got it fixed.	You're on.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.	Will somebody get the damn dog out-	Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?	Easy Morg, don't think about that now.	Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?	Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.	That a fact?	Yeah.  It's a fact.
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.	Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.	That a fact?	Yeah.  It's a fact.	Well I'm real scared.
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.	Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!	Jack...
Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers.	They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.	500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?	Sure...
We should get moving.	Doc's just in no kinda shape.
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.	But she doted on the frowner
Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new Money Ward, too.  33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch.  'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.	Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.	We're gonna do it, boys.  Gonna Get ours.  Feel it in my bones. All we have to do is keep our Eyes on that brass ring.
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?	Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
Look pretty rough.	Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
Well we're off and running.  Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.	Acquired?	So to speak.
Her maiden name was Sullivan.	Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.	I know, I need a keeper.
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.	I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.	Pretty fun too, isn't it?	Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face.  I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture.  That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.	Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.	It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-	Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...	Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?	Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.	You are the one, Wyatt.  You sure are.
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.	Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right.  Just the Same, though...  Guess you better swear me in.
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.	Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.	Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.	You'll never make that stick.	They're carrying guns in town.	Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?	No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.	All right, Virge, your call.  But Give Doc the shotgun.  They'll be Less apt to get nervy if they see Him on the street howitzer.
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.	Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.	Look at 'em all.  They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.	Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
Virgil?	Wyatt...
What about all these saloons?	Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?	Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?	Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.	Yeah, and dangerous.
Why don't you just leave it alone?	No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-	None of my business, Fred.
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'	- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.	What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin?
But -	- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.	Bring up the tracking satellite. And get 007 out of there.
It's too late -	GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -	Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.	Admiral, are you suggesting -
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?	I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -	And I have the entire British economy to worry about.
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?	36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.	I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours. Until then, I'm imposing my own electronic silence: For the sake of the economy, not a word to NATO, the press, the CIA.  ...And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters, I want him to go along as an observer. Are we agreed?
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.	You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark.	I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.  Darling! Come here.  I want you to meet my wife.
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.	Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?	A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.	We'll see about that.
How did you get this number?	Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?	I'm on my way.
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.	Sir Elliot.	Come. Let's get out of the noise.  - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk.
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.	I see.	I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.	I wonder if it runs in the family.	The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.	I can feel your pain.
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?	Sightseeing.
I call this the Rogue's gallery.	Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.	My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.	So why did you leave?	Because it's a dying city. Since the Chinese take-over, who knows what can happen tomorrow?  In any case, this is my father, Charles: A royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations. Said I'd never amount to anything, but...  I turned it into this
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.	And still not a thing to watch.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.	They're merely tools to disseminate information.	Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?	Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK.	...Words to live by?	Your choice.  Look at the time! Come. There's someone I want you meet - about a story I'm thinking of publishing.
Briefly.	Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
...And what's that, my dear?	Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
I'm sure they will.	Good-bye, Mister Bond.
Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl?	My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.	Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -	- Instant melt-down.	Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.	What about the gold?
I'd rather die alone.	Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.	I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.	Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.	I'm sorry.	The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.	Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?	Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'	I appreciate your time -	Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.	Where can I find him?	Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.	Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -	Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.	Four o'clock. Don't be late.	Tsi tien, Chien-penny.	Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.	Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?	In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?	Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -	- We all want what we can't have?	Not all of us, 007.
What - no lust for adventure?	No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
Q! How are you?	Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.	I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -	That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.	Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?	Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.  Next, your new personal communicator.  Picture-phone, fax, beeper.	Do I have to dial '9' to get out?	I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
Your new car.	- Four wheel drive?	Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.	... 17 Beverage cup holders?	Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
I must say, Q, you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement.	Don't even think about it. 007. They're my granddaughters.
Yes -	Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
Wait a minute -	Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
Don't you think you're overreacting?	Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.	...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.	What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there?	Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.	That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.	I know what I saw -
Paris?!? What are you doing here?	Is that any way to say hello?	I thought your specialty was good-bye.
Oh, James. I've missed you -	Is this another one of your games?	Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?	I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?	Nothing.
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?	No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
Do you feel better now?	Do you?
What about the uranium?	It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.	Shhhhh...	Just hold me.
Paris -	Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!	Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?	He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
Just - say it. Say it just once.	One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
His newspapers?	Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.	Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.	"Need I remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the port ""Aberdeen Harbor"" in their honor?"
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.	Political considerations?	To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing.  In fact, I was never here.
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?	Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -	Come on. I know better than that -
It must do something.	Well... If you insist.
Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much time to demonstrate your new Q toys.	How is old Q?	Gone fishing.	Fishing?	Big game fishing.  Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift from his friends at the CIA.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -	Not from forty feet.
... Shoelaces?	Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.	Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?	Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.	Does it work on cash machines?
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.	I see...	Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.	If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?	Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device.
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?	"I believe Q's exact words were:  ""Hopefully, nothing."""
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?	I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.	That's reassuring.	Hey - the world is my office.	Let's take a look at the body.
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...	Something with an engine? Not oars?	Step into my office.
What do you want with the Harbor Master?	Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?	Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok.  Should have seen his rose garden: Blooms the size of hand grenades.
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.	Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
Natalya?	Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.	She married a hockey player.	I envy your 'undercover' assignments.	We work in the dark. We do what we can.
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?	Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.	Can you arrange a meeting?	Hell. The CIA built that club.
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?	He tied one on.
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?	Who knows? Fog, night...	They'd never sail this close to the shore.	Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
I got you covered.	That's reassuring.
Sidney Winch, meet -	Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
Where to now, Jimbo?	I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
Interesting presentation.	Interesting video tape.	They point, I shoot.	Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.	Of course.
... Does this do anything?	Depends what number you write.
Married?	Happily.	... Kids?	Three. You? Married?	No.	I didn't think so.
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.	Thanks.  Take care -	You too.
Bourbon. Neat.	I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.	- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.	Have we met?	This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.	Sidney Winch.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?	No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Boyfriend?	Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.	Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.	So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.	And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?	Insurance. Lloyds of London.	The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.	I'll keep that in mind.	I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.	Nice to run into you again.	Let's not make it a habit.
- Shut up!	You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.	No?	No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.	So charming! So suave!  Don't insult me. I'm not one of your 'little London girls' who falls for the lies.
Do I have to do everything around here?	I hope so.
I hope you'll be gentle.	Think about mom.
And what do you call this?	- The family jewels?
If I were you -	- You're not.	Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.	"Thank you.  ""Now hear this: Drop dead."""
Why don't we just take these -	No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
... Do you have a gun?	What?	You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.	That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.	Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.	Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!	Blood or Dutch?	He was my father's best friend!	He's killed closer.	You are seriously deranged.	Maybe. But why are we going up instead of down?
This has got to be a mistake.	The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
Wait here.	No. I'm going with you.
... How did you get into marine salvage?	My father left me the business.
Not a lot of difference.	What do you mean?
What the hell does that do?	Cleans dirt. Let's go.
Down?	Up.
What now? And don't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me.'	Trust me.
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.	Are you listening to me?	Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.	... We have time for that?
Sometimes you just have to -	Don't say it.
Is this - like - a normal day for you?	It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.	...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.	Another reason??? Did I miss something???	You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.	If not?	We blast through.
Sleep well?	Next time, I do the driving.
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?	I didn't say when I want to die -
... Yes???	Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.	... Yes?	First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.	And number two?	If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.	And when might that be?	Now.
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?	Yes, M.
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?	Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway?	Only what I read in the newspapers.
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -	'Able to topple governments with a single story' - as he says in his press.
... What's Harmsway done?	It seems, 007, we've received a tip
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.	Of course.	Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.	... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?	Yes. 1988. He was furious at the British plan to return Hong Kong, and supposedly started his own negotiations with the Chinese Government. The inquiry went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a rather powerful enemy -
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.	I understand.
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?	We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.	Hopefully, it won't get that far.
...I'll give you a ring from Venice.	Good luck on your mission, 007.
Sorry I'm late -	Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.	I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?	What do you make of all this?	It doesn't quite add up.
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.	Sabotage?	A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air.
... And what do you call these?	Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.	Indeed they are.  Deadly little things.
And what do you call these? The Gang of Two?	Stop it!	I was just getting to the interesting part!	We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?	Remind me.
Sakwa!	Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?	Mandarin. You jerk.  I'm late. I have to get dressed.
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.	Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
Who's in charge here?	I am. What do you want?	You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.	Forget it. No way. I got here first.	Who's Wade?
What's your name?	Captain Morton.
My name is Sidney Winch, and -	Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.	I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.	Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.	I was an attorney!	Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?	No.	You leave me no alternative.
You won't get away with this!	Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -	Pencil it in for the next trip -	The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -	Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -	Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations	No -	The Queen invited you to dinner -	Yes -	And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.	Excellent.
Damn. It's doing it again.	What's wrong?	About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west.
The back-up does the same thing.	Check it again. What about the global positioning satellite? Could there be something wrong with the signal?
How is it now?	Seems to be back to normal, sir.
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!	Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.	Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice.
What is HE doing here?	I see you two have met.
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -	- I told you! He was there! -	- But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond?
He brought that up from the wreck.	...I see.
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!	Thank you, Uncle Elliot.	No matter what the British government says, I won't kill this story.  Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator... And one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later.
How sweet.	My timing always was lousy.
That was too close.	Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.	Excellent.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.	Approaching the first gate.	Start the grinders.
Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.	Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!	You have to leave -	A hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization.  And now that I'm being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same condition: A barren, lifeless rock.  The gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless British government who wouldn't listen.
Take the men. I can finish alone.	You come with me -  You stay here.
Is the helicopter ready?	Fueled and waiting.	Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell!	Get more men up there!
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!	I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?	Yes. Shall we kill them?	No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan.  Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.
What the hell is going on?	It's Bond!	Kill him! Finish it!
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.	...Haven't we already paid him for his services?	Yes, sir. But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment.
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?	No sir! I swear! This is not true!!	You disappoint me, Number Three.
Please sir. Please -	...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.	Thank you sir! Thank you!
What about ID's?	One to seven: Deal the face cards.
Oh, no.	Who is it?	Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.	Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
Who is that?!? What's in the box??	I don't know. He's not in the database -	What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???
Will it go off?	Maybe. Maybe not.	Abort the cruise.
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.	Will the cruise set it off?	Yes.
What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one.	I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.	That's a lie.
I pay my own way.	Since when?
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.	I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.	What did your wife get her?	We got the same thing.
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?	No, it's that when do you have time to be parents to him? You guys don't pick him up until nine, ten at night. You are into yourselves, as the saying goes. Spend some time trying to be parents. Take him to the mountains, fishing. You ought to let him get to know nature.	Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.	Junior spends time with his child.	Oh here we go with that.
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?	Yes.	How come you're not wearing my shoes?	They're too big.
When are you boys going to fix that roof?	Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.	Here I am thinking about myself when poor Harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?	You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.	You used that excuse to get out of the army.	You always got something to say.
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.	Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?	This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.	This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.	Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?	Maybe I can get down there next week.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?	I told her I would if she would give me time.	I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.	You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.	That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.	I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.	I ought to break your damn neck.
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?	You dumb ass, it's Babe Brother.	My name is Sam. Samuel.
I'll drive her to the hospital.	We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.	What is it, noontime?
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.	My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.	I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.	What is a sip of coffee going to do?	Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.	I don't see you crying about my drinking it.	How old are you?
Why don't you come in for a while?	I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.	Will you still get the money from your father?	I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.	Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.	We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.	I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
Why does he always pick on me?	He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.	I don't need that kind of love. And I don't want to be reminded all the time that Big Mama's grandmother was born in slavery. If you really care about me, just tell me how I can make money.
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?	Why in the h...
You okay?	I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.	Like a veil has been lifted?	It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.	Like muddy waters?	It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.	You were in hell?	I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.	Do you think you won?	It was nip and tuck.	And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?	I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there.
Who is it?	Babe Brother.
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.	This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.	He will be alright.
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?	Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.	What for?	I'm going back home with Harry.	I've heard some foolish things in my life.	Harry is coming to pick me up.	Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.	I'm busy.	Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.	Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.	I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.
Did you ever have to use this thing?	That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.
Don't pick up the cards if you are not in the game. Did he die?	I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
What is that?	Boy, that is the real South. That is real corn liquor.
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?	It is just a regular card.	Son, I can take everything you got with that deck. It is marked. Now I'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere.
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.	Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
I could swear I heard my son call me.	You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.	I heard his voice as clear as day. I better get back. Maybe something is wrong.
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.	This would be a bad time for me to leave.	We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra?  Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up.  What would you give to be rich?
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.	I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.	Not anymore, not in the city.	We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.	Well, you just have to move further out.	Now how far would further out be?	I'm not here to argue, sir.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?	Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.	Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.	I don't know how two brothers can be so different.
Let us settle this tomorrow.	Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
Your feet are cold.	Go back to sleep.	I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.	You all act like two roosters.	I'm not going to let him get away with murder.	You and Babe Brother are so much alike...	He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.	Hush.	You're always taking his side.	Hush.	I'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him.	You're going to find yourself on the floor.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.	Babe Brother is a poor boy.
Well, it's up to Suzie.	It would be nice.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.	No, I'm too hot now.	You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.	I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.	Gideon, don't say things like that.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.	No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
I'm worn out.	Just stay in bed and rest.	I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.	You stay inside. I will see to them.	I will appreciate that.
It's good to be able to hear that.	You must have been really sick.	How is the garden doing?	I need to get out there and get those weeds out.	How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick.
What, are you having another party?	You better come sit down. You are still sick.	Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
Since this morning.	What happened to your hand?	I cut it on an old rusty knife.
What did you put on it?	It's healing now.
"He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, ""I thought the streets were paved with gold."" ""They are but you won't see them,"" he said. ""Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness."" So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. ""Man, this is a dream."" He asked, ""What's you'll doing?"" They all hollered back, ""Sinning."" The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, ""Please to meet you."" He asked, ""I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire."" Someone said, ""Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins."" The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth..."	I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.	I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.	I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...	But these are white people, anybody. The punch...	I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.	It's only a tale.
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.	He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
Boy, that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom.	He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.	Why didn't you catch a plane?	My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.	Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.	I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.	Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
Man, act like this is your home.	That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window	I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
Good morning.	You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.	Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.	I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.	Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.	Well, I would appreciate that.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?	It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.	Everything these days is made overseas.	You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.	Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.	I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.	Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.	You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.	You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.	My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.	'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
Haven't the years been good to Hattie?	It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.	I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.	Well, I don't want to put you out.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.	You should go back and rest.	No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.	Where we come from, you had to know how to act right. You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir. You had to know your place.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.	"You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say ""go on in there brick and hit somebody"" and it would find its mark."	I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.	All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
I have someone I want you to meet.	I'll be right there.
Harry, you know everything.	You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
What's the problem here?	She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
How is everybody?	Tolerable well.
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?	He wasn't able to get out of bed today.	I hope that it's nothing serious.	He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.	Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.	You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
That smells like fresh coffee.	Let me get you a cup?	Only if you can spare it.
How is he doing?	As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.	I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra and I thought you need a rest. I'll stand guard. Okra wants to talk to you anyway.
Good afternoon, ladies.	Good afternoon to you.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.	You must have done something to her.	Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.	Hattie is a different person now.	I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?	I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.	You invited me.	Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?	Now who are we talking about?	Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...	Wasn't Hocker lynched?	You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?	What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.	Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.	Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.	Those boys never did have good luck.	You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.	Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth.
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.	That's nice.	Well, you and your husband are special. Ya, Gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor.
How many people do you all feed?	Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.	Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.	Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.	Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't.  You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste.
I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.	Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?	Girl, do you still sing and dance?	No, I'm a different person now, Harry.
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.	Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.	Some people grow up and change their ways.	I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.	My mother passed on years ago.
None of your business.	That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
"You know the saying, ""your heart is in your left hand."""	Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.	I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.	"""Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."""
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.	Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
Is this your house?	Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.	I already have, my dear.
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.	Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.	He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.	Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.	All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.	You never know what's in the heart and just because you can cry doesn't make you human.
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.	Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.	I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.	I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.	What's a toby?	You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.	I thought you weren't old fashioned.	In some things. When we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a X.
Did you have your child at home?	No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.	Some folks take that natural stuff too far.	Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.	Country people got so many strange ways,
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.	I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.	I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.	Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you -- you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.	Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.	I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.	He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.	I can't accuse him just dry long 80.	Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.	What must I do?	If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.	Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.	When did you talk to Harry?	Don't shout!
He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.	Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.	Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? They all smell of moth balls.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.	I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.	Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
What are you doing?	Counting the gray hairs in your head.	Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?	I was just trying to make conversation.	Where is Skip?	He is in his pigeon cage.	I'm sorry he got those birds.	You know the man next door is near death.
How are you?	Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.	It is so considerate of you.
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.	I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.	But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.	I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Wow!  Cool!	Whadda ya think?	Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
Can we leave this up 'til we move?	Well, sure, we can leave it up.	Yeah!	Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.	Okay.
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!	Oh, yeah!
To infinity and beyond!	Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?	Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!
Can I bring some toys?	You can bring ONE toy...	Just one?
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?	No, I haven't seen him.
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.	But Mom, I can't find him!	Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!	Okay...
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.	Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Can I help pump the gas?	Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Yeah?!	Yeah -- when you're sixteen.	Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
Next stop...	Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Mom, have you seen Woody?	Where was the last place you left him?	Right here in the van.	Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.	He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.	But what if we leave them behind?	Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
"Everybody say, ""Bye, house."""	Bye, house.
Hey!  Wow!	What?  What is it?	Woody!  Buzz!	Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?	Here!  In the car!	See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
Which one can I open first?	Let's let Molly open one.
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.	I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.	Oh, hey - it was nothing.	Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?	Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.	Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?	I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
What are you doing over there?	It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
We're almost there.	Rocky!  The ramp!
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.	Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?	Mm-hmmmmm.
Hello-o-o...	HO-YAAAHH!!!
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.	I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?	Well, let's see, we've got double A's --	Watch yourself!!
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.	Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
Toy?	T-O-Y.  Toy.	Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.	The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --	Excuse me.
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.	No, you can't.	Yes, I can.	You can't!	Can!	Can't!  Can't!  Can't!	I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!	Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.	All right, then, I will.  Stand back everyone!
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.	That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.	What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.	Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
Don't even think about it, cowboy!	Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
"You actually think you're THE ""Buzz Lightyear?"" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!"	You're mocking me, aren't you?	Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!	Where?
What's going on?	Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.	I'd better take a look anyway.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?	That's why.  Sid.	Sure is a hairy fellah.	No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
THAT is Sid!	You mean that happy child?
I could have stopped him.	Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!	Trouble?!  Where?!	Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!	Then we've no time to lose!!
Right?  Buddy?	I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.	Oh.  Oh, that's good.	But we're not on my planet, are we?	No.
According to my nava-computer, the --	Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!	Sheriff, this is no time to panic.	This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!	My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --	Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --	Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.	WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!	Go away.
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?	Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.	Well, then let's climb abroad.
No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.	Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Ow!  Watch where you're going!	Sorry.
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!	You mean it has hyperdrive?	Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...	Where is it?  I don't see the --
Spaceship.	Alright Buzz, get ready...
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --	YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
I've set my laser from stun to kill.	Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.	Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Woody, we don't know what's out there!	I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!	Shield your eyes!
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --	Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!	Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!	Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
Woody, stop it!!	Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.	Don't tell me what to do!	Shhh!
What happened to you?	One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.	Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!!
Oh, I'm a sham!!	Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.	Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...	Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
Come on, this way!	Years of Academy training...wasted!!
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.	I can't help.  I can't help anyone.	Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.	Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.	Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.	No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.	Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.	Yeah, right.	No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.	But why would Andy want me?	Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --	Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.	Yes Sir!
Woody!  It's the moving van.	We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Shhhhhhh!	What?!	It's ok.  Everything's under control.
Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.	Woody!
Hold on, Woody!	I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!	NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
Well, thanks for the ride.	Look out!!
Great!	Woody!  The rocket!	The match!
Woody?!  What are you doing?	Hold still, Buzz!
Ha-ha!!	You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!	Not today!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!	This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!	Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!	We're not aiming for the truck!
Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?	Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.	Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!	Stay calm, everyone!!
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!	Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!	Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!	What's with him?
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!	Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Hi!	Everyone, it's Woody!
Something's screwy here.	So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!	I can't see a thing!
Hey, watch it!	Sorry there, old Spudhead.
Let's string him up by his pull- string!	I got dibs on his hat!
B-3.	Miss.  G-6.	Ohhh!  You sunk it!	Heh-heh.	Are you peeking?	Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!	How 'bout three out of five?
Son of a building block, it's Woody!	He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Oh, that is disgusting.	Murderer!
What?	Did I get my package in the mail?	I dunno.	Whaddaya mean, you don't know?	I don't know!	Oh no, Hannah!	What?	Look!  Janie!
Hey!!	She's sick!	No she's NOT --	I'll have to perform one of my...operations!	NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!	Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
MOM!!  MOM!!	She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
Oh, no!	Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?	Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.	Have you been replaced?
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.	And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?	Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
That ain't no happy child.	He tortures toys -- just for fun.
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.	Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Aa-a-a-a-ah!	Will you quit moving around?!	I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.	How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.	Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
A lunchbox?!	A lunchbox...?!
Laser-envy.	All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...	Alright!  That's it!
Who is it this time?	I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?	That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!	Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!	Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?	No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!	You are a liar!	No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!	Nothing.
No!  No, no, no, no!	You murdering dog!	No, it's not what you think, I swear!	Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!	Come on.  Let's get out of here.
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!	Toss 'im overboard!	No, no, no, wait!
ROOAAAARR!!!	Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.	I was close to being scared that time.
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.	But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.	Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?	Yes!  Yes!  We promise!	Okay, save your batteries!
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!	Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!	Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!	Hey look!  It's Buzz!	Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
They're getting bigger.	Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
What the heck is up there?	Woody?  Who's up there with you?
It's Sid!	I thought he was at summer camp!
We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?	Oh, I don't like confrontations.
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!	There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
I got it, Woody!	He got it, Woody!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?	Sir!  No Sir!	Okay, thank you.  At ease.
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.	Yes SIR!
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.	This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!	Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.
Okay, we're on the last present now...	Last present!	It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame!  Repeat!  Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame!
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.	So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
There.	Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!	Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry!
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?	I can't quite make out --
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...	Uh-oh.
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.	Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
This is ludicrous.	
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!	Sid!!!
Reach for the sky!!	Huh?
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!	What?!
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...	It's busted.
W-w-w-we?	That's right.  Your toys.
Hey, Slinky?	Right here, Woody!
I'm red this time.	No, Slink --	Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.	Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.	Bad news?!	Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!	Got it.
Woody, what are you doing under the bed?	Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --	Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
Woody?!	We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!	I knew you'd come back, Woody!
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.	See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
Woody!  Speed up!	Speed up!
I can't hold on much longer!	Slink!  Hang on!
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -	But you're Irish!	There's no law, as I know of, to prevent it.
You'll put your clothes here.	There's no mirror.	There's not.
I can manage.	Excuse me.
He's a pyjama case, really.	Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.	I like plaits.	You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!	I did like the music.	I carried you up to your bed.
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.	A sin against <i>what?</i>	Slip up and change into a skirt, else he'll create something terrible. Don't you want to make a good impression on your first day?
Is there anything else I should know about him?	Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.	He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.	She got away.
He made that. In his off hours.	It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.	Didn't you know he made things?
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.	I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
I want to go home.	Home is where the heart is.	I can't go home because there's no home left.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.	She'll have to learn.	What about school?
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?	Get away from me...
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.	Is that all?	Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.	Go away.	What did I do wrong?
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.	Do what?  Oh, I see.	You're only a young thing.	You're not so old yourself!	Living with him put years on me.
Who's there?	Let me in.
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.	Well ... yes. All right. But -	Ah, come on now!
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?	Finn -	I'm cold.
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?	I finished it off.	You did what?
He'll murder you when he finds out.	He'll be looking for another apprentice.	I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.	Can you move over a wee bit?
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.	Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
Stop it!	I've got a present for you...	Finn ...	In my pocket.
Reprieve.	I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.	H'm?	Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.	It was only a mouthful!	Do you think we should take her up to bed?
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.	Did you now.	Surely she is older?	What difference does <i>that</i> make?
How long has -	All the time.
I already lost everything once.	So did I.	But then I had a brother and a sister left.	So had I.	Everything is gone, now.	Nothing is left but us.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '	Storms?
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.	We're too young.	I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.	Juliet who?	In the play. She was married, by my age. And Mummy. Mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. Well, not <i>that</i> much older.
I'm Melanie.	You're late for breakfast.
Did you do this?	Victoria -	What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys.  Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
You're well built; how old are you?	Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.	I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda and the swan. See?
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.	It's all right, Finn.
I appreciate you coming in so early.	Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.	Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.	Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?	I don't know what you mean.	I mean, did you ask her?  What kind of drugs has she tried?
I... I don't really know.	Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?	No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.	Well, I hope it stays that way.
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.	He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?	I can't find Manolo.	He's not here.	He never came home last night.  Was he with you?	No.
What?  What is it?	It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
Why does he need money?	He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.	How much?	Nine thousand dollars.
What is he planning on telling them?	Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.	I want to believe you.  I really do.	You will believe me, because it's true.
Helena, I'm so sorry --	Arnie, thank God.
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.	Why are you talking like that?	Listen to me carefully.  First of all, Carl isn't here.  DEA's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow.  So here you're wasting your time.  Are you with me?
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?	Arnie, this is crazy.
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.	What is he being charged with?	I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.	Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.	That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.	Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
"If all our assets are frozen and our ""sales force"" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?"	You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.	How much do I pay him?	I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.	Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.	Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.	Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?	Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.	Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.	What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --	Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.	Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.	I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.	I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar.  And I'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that?
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.	I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.	Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.	That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.	I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
Helena --	I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.	I can't do that.
Did you get it?	What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?	It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.	Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
Don't bother.	What?	So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?	I was just waiting for the right time.	And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?	I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.	You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.	Carl, that's insane.	So my wife is lying?	Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.	Carl --	Goodbye Arnie.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.	Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.	That's frustrating.	It's so frustrating.
I think she's lying.	Me, too.	We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.	Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --	Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.	Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?	This is different.	Why?	To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.	I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --	Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?	We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
How long have you known?	Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --	Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.	She asked me not to.
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.	Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.	Barbara --	Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.	The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.	If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.	Look, I'm as worried as you are --	No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.	Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.	I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.	Oh, it is?	Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
Should we bring the police into this?	No, not yet.
About the other night, I'm sorry.	Me, too.	God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?	I don't know.
My Leica's gone.	So's the video camera.	At least she's alive.
Where are you going?	She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
Did you meet the President?	Honey, your father knows the President.
Czar for life, just like a real czar.	That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.	Caroline --	Sorry, but I mean, come on.
Did you tell Dad?	Not yet.	Are you going to?	I don't know.	Is this bad for him?	What do you think?
He didn't hang around us.  He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?  I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?	How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.	He's a friend.  He's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation.  He'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive.  We didn't know what else to do.  It wasn't my pot.
Hi.	Hi.	What's up?	Just watching you.	I got that.  How was your day?
You all right?	I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
How's David?	How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.	Helena --	We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --	How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.	Helena --	Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with.  I won't do it.  I want our life back.
"What's it like?  Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say ""please"" or ""thank you."""	What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?	Fine -- legalization.  Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today.  The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions.  The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy.  Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion.
What if every country legalized at the same time?	Somehow, I don't see that happening.
"As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some ""face time""."	Will we get invited to the White House?	I don't know.	How long's the job?	It's a presidential appointment so... until I quit or get fired.
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?	Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
Okay, young lady, that's it.	Like I give a fuck.
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.	You can't make me.	Oh, yes I can.
...How old are you?	Sixteen	Live with your parents?	Yes.	Parents still together?	Yes.	Do you work?	I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.	In school?	Cincinnati Country Day.
Private?	Yeah.	How are your grades?	I'm third in my class.	What's that mean?	I get A's.  All A's.	You do?  What else you do?	I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
What are you doing?	Just watch.
Inhale the smoke and hold it.	What is this, like freebase?	Not like.  It is.
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --	We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --	He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --	Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --	Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.	Have you done your homework, honey?	Yes, mom --	Then here's a little bump.
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?	I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.	Why?  Nobody's there.
No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling?	I feel good.	No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?	Nope.
Chill out --	It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume?
Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up.	We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business.  We got you.
That's a big word for a fisherman.	Who do you work for?
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.	She ain't in on it.	I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.	I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.	She knows Arnie Metzger.	So does half of San Diego.	You want to make a wager on this?
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.	Maradona is a cokehead.  Hand of God, my ass.  We're wasting our time here.	He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.	Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
Are you getting this on tape?	I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
What do we do?	I don't know.
What do you think she wants?	She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?	Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?	Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman.
What do you think it is?	Depends who it's from.	Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.	You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.	What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?	Depends on the state.	Arizona.	Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?
I'll put this in the back.	No --	All the professionals keep them in the trunk.	Not Tiger Woods.	Especially Tiger Woods.  ...Actually, he keeps his on the back seat.
David --	We're playing!
Women's room, stall two.  Should we stop for ice-cream?	Yeah!
Yes.	I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?	You may speak.	I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.	You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?	I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.	When will you do it?	I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.	There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
They're going to walk right past me.	What are you?  A mouse?  Get out of the car and do it.  This is your chance.
So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City --	Nobody said shit, Eduardo --
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.	I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --	Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.	You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.	The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us believe you got a boss.  No boss, it's all on you.	It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.	We can protect you.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.	So you pay off our customs officials?	In Mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity, this is not so true for the USA.  Using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search.  The odds are not high, and we found variables that reduce the odds.  We hire drivers with nothing to lose.  Then we throw a lot of product at the problem.  Some get stopped.  Enough get through.  It's not difficult.
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?	I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.	He hired you.  That was a mistake.	Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?	When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
You expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder.	That thought makes me feel awful.
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened?  That my drugs had gone through.  What would have been the harm?  A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive.  We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?	You're breaking my heart.	The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.	So go shower already.	You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana. You're helping them.  You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.	Yes, sir!	We aren't barbarians.	Yes, sir!	Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?	I don't know, sir.	You will dine with me from now on.
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.	No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.	Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?	I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.	My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.	That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.	I don't think you're going to do that.	You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.	There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.	But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children.  Are you aware of this?	I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.	We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.	You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.	Not in...
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.	I don't believe you.
You first.	I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.	Fine, then we don't have deal.	Fine, then we don't have a deal.
That's good coke.	It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.	Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test. I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.	That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.	Exactly, and this is how I know I'm not getting into business with the U.S. Government.
You will help me with my other problem.	Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
Wasn't that General Salazar?	Yeah.	What's he doing up here?	I don't know.  Something.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.	They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.	She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.	Anyway, I don't think we'll ever see them again.  Everything's back to normal.
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.	The police won't find your car.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.	Then I guess I'm going by myself.
A group of us are going out tonight.	Who?	Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --	Your new friends.	Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?	Not this time.
It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.	Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?	No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.	Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
Madrigal's alive.	What?	Porfirio Madrigal is not dead.  I just saw him.
Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --	We keep our mouths shut.
Somewhere safe.	Where?	A place we have, that we know is protected.	No.
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.	We agree.	So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.	We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.	This is a very different proposition.
You should feel good about this.	I feel like a traitor.
What's your name?	Javier Rodriguez.	Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done a very good job, but we'll take care of it from here.
One question.  How did you find about this?	An informant.	What is the name of your informant?	It was an anonymous tip.
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?	If I can.	I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.	What is it you want me to do?	A small thing.  Nothing really.
Does this offer include my partner?	Only if he can be trusted.	He'll do what I say.
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.	Everybody has a weakness.
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.	But will he be house-trained?	When he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here. He will freely give the names of his superiors.  Then we get them and they too will give us names.  And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall.
The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?	I'm aware of that.	So what's it doing in Tijuana?
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?	It could mean that, yes.	That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?	It's possible.	Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
My work keeps me young.	Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?	The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.	Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.	We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.	Noriega is a criminal.	Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.	Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.	I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.	If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.	Any idea how much?	I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.	What do you look for?	We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.	Any way we can do it better?	Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?	That triple the amount of stuff is going through.	Right.  But, that's not the biggest problem.  One of our Intel officers picked up information from DEA that traffickers have come up with a process, a chemical process, to turn coke into something else.  It doesn't smell like coke.  It doesn't look like coke.  And what's worse, it doesn't react to field test.  It could be anything.  Maybe it's already happening.  I mean, how would we know?
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.	This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.	I need to find my daughter.  I'll pay you.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?	I have money --	I got money.	I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.	I want your money, I'll take your money.	Just tell me where she is.
She's not at that place you sent her?	She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.	Oh, man --	She hasn't called you?	I tried to talk to her when she was up there, but they wouldn't put me through.  I'm surprised she hasn't called.
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?	I don't know what to say.	I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.	You won't say anything to my parents?	I don't give a fuck about your parents --	We sometimes went downtown to score.	What?	The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --	You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away.  And neither does she.
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.	You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
I don't know, maybe we missed her.	I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.	Hey man, back the fuck up.  To this place.  What's that shit?  Right now, all over this country, a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see, You got any drugs?  You know where I can get drugs?  What kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person, on their possibilities?  If you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood, Indian Hills, and they asked every white person they saw, hey, you got any drugs?, within a day, your friends and their kids would be selling. It's market forces, man.  The product's marked up three hundred percent.  You can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day.  You think white people would still be going to law school?
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.	I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.	That would be very helpful to me.  Also, I received the offer from DEA and the FBI to train some of my men at Quantico.  I think this will be extremely useful, a good way for us to absorb some of your methods.
You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.	Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.	Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.	Yes, I hope so as well.	Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?	Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.	Like you protected Landry?	I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.
Hello.	I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.	What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.	Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.	I'll get there as soon as I can.	If we're moving the press conference, we need to do it now.  Are you all right?
Who are these guys?	Agents who died in the field.
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?	Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
Who do we interface with on their side?	What do you mean?	I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?	I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized.
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.	Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --	He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --	What kind of research?	Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --	It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
Did you tell him?	No. On you go.
What?	The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.	Well, I've not brought them.	It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.	Well, I've not brought them.	It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.	I'm sorry.	Bit fucking late, like.	Well, why didn't you bring them?	Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.	Christ.
OK. Same again?	I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?
I'll be right after you.	You'll never catch us, you flabby bastard. Right, see, when I come back --
I want the money, Mark, that's all.	If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
I don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out like, and treat her -- properly.	Shag her senseless.	No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --	You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.	You've stabbed me, man.	You were in my way.
Twenty thousand.	But it's not worth more than fifteen.	Ninteen.
For fuck's sake.	Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.	All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.	Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.	Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.
And remember, Rents: no skag.	Aye, OK, Fr.  But the good times couldn't last for ever.
It's a scandal, Franco.	Too right it is. Now look, have you got anything to eat, 'cos I'm fucking Lee Marvin, by the way.
What?	I've no fucking cigarettes.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.	Can you not go yourself.	I'm a fugitive from the law. I can't be seen on the fucking streets. Now watch my lips. Kempton Park. Two-thirty. Five pounds to win. Bad Boy.
I'm no a fucking buftie and that's the end of it.	Let's face it, it could have been wonderful.
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.	Jesus.	Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.	Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.	Did you bring the cards?
Buy yourself that island in the sun?	For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.	I'd fucking kill you.	I guess you would, Franco.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.	Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.	Thanks.	What's your name?	Diane.	Where are you going, Diane?	I'm going home.	Where's that?	It's where I live.	Great.	What?	I'll come back if you like, but I'm not promising anything.
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?	Eh-	Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.	think I left something back at the -
Diane.	Ssshh!	Sorry.	Shut up.
Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.	Right. You can't sleep here.	What?	Out.	Come on.	No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.	Jesus.	And don't make any noise.
I don't see why not.	Because it's illegal.	Holding hands?	No, not holding hands.	In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.	And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.	Easy for you to say.	Can I see you again?	Certainly not.
What do you want?	Are you clean?	Yes.	Is that a promise, then?	Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.	Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?	No.	I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.	Well, it isn't.	Smells like it.	You're too young.	Too young for what?
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.	It's Iggy Pop.	Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.	Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.	The point is, you've got to find something new.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.	Unless you get caught.	So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.	So why have you told me about it?	Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.	I've got a boyfriend, Mark.	What? Steady like?	That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.	And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?	Sixteen next month.	Happy birthday.	What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
So, what's he like?	Well, he's young and he's healthy.
I read it in Cosmopolitan.	It's an interesting theory.	Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.	What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?	What happened?	He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.	What was it, pneumonia or cancer?	No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.	Eh? How's that?
I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.	Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.	I didn't either. What the fuck is it?
Tommy, let's put the tape on.	Now?	Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.	Fuck, OK.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?	It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.	Returned it? Where? To the video shop, Tommy? To the fucking video store? So every punter in Edinburgh is jerking off to our video? God, Tommy, I feel sick.
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.	Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.	One of Edinburgh's finest schools.	Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --	I'm an old boy myself, you know?	Oh, really?	Do you recall the school motto?	Of course, the motto, the motto --	Strive, hope, believe and conquer.	Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.	Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?	Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?	"You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you ""foot in the door"", as you put it."	Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it?
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.	The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.	Sorry about last night -
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.	No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.	There's no need.	It's no problem.	No problem for me either.  Honestly, it's no problem.	I'd really rather take care of it myself.	Spud, they're my sheets.
Are you getting out much?	No.	Following the game at all?	No.	No. Me Neither.
You take the test?	Aye.	Clear?	Aye.	That's nice.	I'm sorry, Tommy.	Have you got any gear on you?	No, I'm clean.	Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque.
Thanks, Mark.	No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
Good luck, Spud.	Cheers.	Now remember --	Yeah.	If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?	Right.	But try too hard --	And you might get the fucking job.	Exactly.	Nightmare.	It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.	My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.	Try this.
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.	Another dab?	Would not say no, would not say no.
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?	Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.	People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.	I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.	The only drawback, or at least the principal drawback, is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that -
You Only Live Twice?	Nineteen-sixty-seven.	Running time?	One hundred and sixteen minutes.	Director?	Lewis Gilbert.	Screenwriter?	Eh - Ian Fleming?	Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.	OK, so who was it, then?	You can look it up.
Who wrote it?	But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.	You don't know, do you?	And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.	The park?	Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.	Who wrote it?	Roald Dahl.	Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.	What do you mean?	Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -	Some of his solo stuff's not bad.	No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.	So who else?	Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -	OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.	What about The Untouchables?	I don't rate that at all.	Despite the Academy award?	That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.	Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?	Yeah.	That's your theory?	Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.	Give me the gun.
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?	Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.	What's wrong, Allison?
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.	It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.	Say something, Mark, say something --	I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
Eughh. Sounds horrible.	It wasn't that bad.	Did he -- you know?	What?	You know.	No, he didn't make me touch it.	Oh no, don't even mention it.	He made me lick it.	God, you're sick.	And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.	Cut it out.	When are you going to visit him?	Don't know. Maybe Thursday.	You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.	You're all hear.	I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?	Fuck you.	And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing?
I can't believe you did that.	I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.	It was my fucking television.	Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
Why?	Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.	Why would I want to sell my passport?	It was just an idea.
What?	There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.	How much?	About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }	So?	So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.	So we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me about a skag deal?
What was your price?	Four Grand.	But you don't have the money?	We're two thousand short.	That's tough.	Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.	Sorry, boys, I don't have two thousand pounds.
From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.	Are you serious?	Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.	Well, it's up to you.	I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.	Sure, sure. I've heard it before.	The Sick Boy method.	Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.	He's always been lacking in moral fibre.	He knows a lot about Sean Connery.	That's hardly a substitute.	you'll need one more hit.	No, I don't think so.	To see you through the night that lies ahead.
What's on the menu this evening?	Your favourite dish.	Excellent.	Your usual table, sir?	Why, thank you.
And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?	Stick it on my tab.	Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.	In that case --
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.	As you wish.
Great.	And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.	Sure.	The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.	Sounds great, Swanney.	Yeah.	You'll have to send us a postcard.	Sure will, pal, sure will.
This had better be good.	It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.	If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.	Such as?	Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?
There.	Are you serious?
It's the great outdoors.	It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?	It's fresh air.	Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.	Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?
How's it going with Gail?	No joy yet.	How long is it?	Six weeks.	Six weeks!	It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.	Where did she come up with that?	She read it in Cosmopolitan.	Six weeks and no sex?	I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.	That's fair enough.	Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.	Went ballistic?	Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'	So what's it going to be?	Well, I've paid for the ticket.
We go for a walk.	What?	A walk.	But where?
Well, what are you waiting for?	I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
What do you see as your main strengths?	I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.	Homeless people?	No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --	Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?	No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
Qual se tu?	It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.	It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.	Magnificent. You are the first to find me.	We sought only your infinite wisdom.	And how did you breach the Barrier?	With a starship!	This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?	It could. Yes.	Then I shall make use of this starship.	It will be your chariot!
He has his doubts...	You doubt me?
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?	He doubts me.
No, no, it's not possible.	Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!	The ship....	Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
I couldn't help but notice you pain.	My pain?	It runs deep. Share it with me.
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.	Rescued at last.	Return to prearranged coordinates for pickup.
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.	Is there a problem, gentlemen?
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.	Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!	Don't worry, fellas. Your secret's` safe with me. I'll send the shuttlecraft to pick you up.
Admit it. We're lost.	All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!	And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
Sulu, what are you doing?	Plotting our new course.	New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?	Pavel.
Following new course. Warp seven.	Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
In firing position. Torpedo armed.	But, Captain, we're firing directly on your position.
Shuttle en route.	Position, Bird of Prey?	Closing.
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.	Raise shields.	But the shuttle-	DO it. Go to Red Alert.
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?	I don't have a clue.
This is the Starship Enterprise.	A Federation starship.	This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.	Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.	Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.	We will be happy to beam down. But first we must have certain assurances.
What's going on?	I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.	Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
Can we have it quiet?	Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.	Bob?	Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
You caught me on my way to the shower.	I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.	"On ""The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"""	The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...	With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.	Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.	Oh, please.	Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.	Have the Klingons responded?	No, but you can bet they will.	Understood. Kirk out.
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.	It's all I have.
Your pain runs deep.	What do you know of my pain?	Let us explore it together.
Where did you get this power?	The power was within you.	I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?	Join my quest.	What is it you seek?	What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.	A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.	Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.	But how?	Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?	I think you gave me too much time, Captain.	Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.	Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.	I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.	Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.	If we could send a distress signal...
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?	Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.	Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.	Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.	Why didn't you beep my communicator?	ER... You forgot to take it with you.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.	Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.	Put it on the screen.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.	Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.	Respond with static. Let them think we're having difficulty. Which wouldn't be far from the truth.	Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.	Transporter room. Status.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.	Go, Sulu.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?	I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.	I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...	And that is?	Because it's there.	Ah, Captain?	MM.?	I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?	I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.	Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
Oh, God	"Perhaps ""because it is there"" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain."
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.	I don't understand.	I've always known... I'll die alone.
What are you doing?	I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.	That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
"""Pack Up Your Troubles."""	Are we leaving, Captain?
"""Row, row, row your boat..."" I love ""Row...""  Do - do you know ""Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"""	That song did not come up in my research, Captain.	"The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, ""Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.."" The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in.  Doctor, if you please."
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?	I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Captain?	Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.	Jim.	Yes, Spock?	Life is not a dream.	Go to sleep, Spock.	Yes, Captain.	Goodnight, Bones.
Goodnight, Spock.	Goodnight, Doctor.
I could use a shower.	Yes.
Not General Korrd.	The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.	General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.	Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?	I cannot be certain.	But he does seem familiar?	He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
I do not often think of the past.	Who is it he reminds you of?	There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.	What do you mean?	The knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by Vulcan belief.
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.	Why?	He believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.	Fascinating.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.	Damn.  Let's go.
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.	That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.	To land any closer would risk detection.	Mr. Sulu. Execute.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.	We don't have 1.2 hours.
Spock.	Yes, Captain?	Be one with the horse.	Yes, Captain.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.	An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
You must allow us to act.	Let me do something.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!	Captain, what have I done -	What you have done is betray every man on this ship.	Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.	Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!	If you think it would help.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.	If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.	I ordered you to defend this ship.	You ordered me to kill my brother.	Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...	No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!	I did not.	You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.	Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.	There, you see? See?	I have a half brother.	I gotta sit down.
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.	Why didn't you tell me this before?	I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.	He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
There's got to be a way out of this place.	This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.	How do you know?	The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.	This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?	He did have pointed ears.
Is it possible?	Is what possible?	That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.	But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.	Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.	Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.	I am here, Captain.	That's a little vague, Spock -
"You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an ""s."""	"A ""t."""	"""a""... ""n""...uh, ""d""... end of word."
"New word. ""b"".. ""a""... um..."	"""c.""... ""k."""
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.	The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
I believe I have found a faster way.	Hmmm?	Uh-uh.
It would appear we are too heavy.	It must be all those marsh melons.
Spock... the booster rockets.	If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.	Fire the rockets!
Spock.	The emergency channel, open.	To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.
...mark two.	Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
Spock... don't.	It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
What is this?	I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Spock?	Welcome aboard, Captain.
Spock, I thought I was going to die.	Not possible. You were never alone.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?	I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.	Yes. I lost a brother once. I was lucky. I got him back.
I must have your starship.	You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
Who are you?	James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.	But I thought Captain Chekov..  I see. Very clever, Captain.  Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?
No! No reply. Remain on course.	Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
What are you doing?	In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
We must change our course at once.	I'll take you to the bridge.
I trust your message was received?	You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.	What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?	I'm afraid of nothing.
"Sha Ka Ree. ""The Scource."" ""Heaven."" ""Eden."" call it ""Qui'Tu."" To the Romulans, it's ""Vorta Vor."" The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality."	The only realty I see is that I'm a prisoner on my own ship. What is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?	I don't control minds. I free them.
Spock...  What have you done to my friends?	I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
No... I didn't.	Now learn something about yourself.	No. I refuse.
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.	But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?	Your vision?	Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.	You are mad!	Am I? We'll see.
About the ship...	The ship needs its Captain.	No special conditions?	No conditions.	What makes you think I won't turn us around?	Because you, too, must know.
What have I done?	Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...	Spock...
			
	
			
		
	
	
Borgus Frat.	"""Let's see what she's got,"" said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?"	I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.	Uhura, I thought you were on leave.	And I thought we were supposed to be going together.	Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.	I had a feeling you would say something like that. So I brought us dinner.
They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.	Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.	Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.	Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.	He's not?	No. Sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we've always been afraid to express.
No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.	Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.	It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-	I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
I am a Starfleet Officer.	Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
Sybok, you must surrender.	No. You must kill me.
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?	No. I will not.	You know I'm right.
Each man's pain is unique.	I hide no pain.	I know you better than that.	Do you?
Spock?	I cannot go with you.	Why not?	I belong here.	I don't understand...	Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!	I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
Sybok.	This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...	Sybok, we must find a way...	No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
You did break in.	Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...	Are you embezzling?	"""Embezzling"" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together."	I don't get it.	You haven't told him?
Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.	You invented Space Paranoids?	"Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has ""invented"" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?"	Senior exec.	Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.	I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.	Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
Dillinger?	Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...	Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Hi, Alan.	Hi, Flynn.
My dinner.	I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.	Want one?	Uh... got any cinnamon?
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.	I know, I met him.
Your old files -- ?	And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.	Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?	Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
How's it going upstairs?	Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
Did you say Group 7 access?	Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set	Did he say why?	Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?	Flynn had Group 7 access.	Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.	Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.	Okay, okay...	I want to go to his place.	You call that getting over it?	I mean I want both of us to go.
What for?	To warn him.	Of what?	That Dillinger's on to him.
For what?	For being on to Dillinger.	What -- ?
Flynn!	Uh, no ... I mean, not that often -
I don't think I'm cleared for this.	I'm certainly not.
Beautiful!	Hello, Alan.	Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.	Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?	Yes...but you have to go roundtrip, and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance. Hah!
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.	Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...	They'll start to soon enough.	Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
Come on in...	Alan. Alan Bailey.	Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.	oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?	Yeah...?	We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.	I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.	No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?	It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.	Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?	No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.	Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.	Ok
"What do you mean, ""'yes""?"	Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
That all you can say?	No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.	Oh. Anything else?	Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.	only yes and no...  You're a bit.	For sure...	where's your program? Won't it miss you?	No...
I'm your program?	Right on the money!	Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate?
Way to go! We're haulin'!	Yes, okay, exactement!
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...	No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
This town's full o' live ones.	Not a chance.
You said it.	So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
Yes!	Let's get outta here.
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?	It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.	Flynn?	Yes.  It felt like Flynn.	He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?	I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...	Meanwhile, he might find it.	I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.	I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.	There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.	Cute.	End of line.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.	I'm sorry -	I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?	It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...	And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...	The Pentagon?	It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.	Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.	I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.	What do you want with the Pentagon?	The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.	If you think -	You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?	You wouldn't dare.	So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -	Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --	That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --	The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --	User requests are what computers are for.	Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...	It can be arranged...
That was uncalled-for.	I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?	Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
Yes?	I... have come to communicate with my User.	Hmm. A difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best.  Perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days ...
Well I want to communicate --	Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.	Hah.	Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.	When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
Who is your User, program?	Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?	All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
Dumont!	No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...	Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?	They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
Alan!	Where did you hear that name?	Well, isn't it -- ?	The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?	I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...?
What, just the three of us?	You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters?
What's that?	Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
How about over there...that empty memory?	No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
Flynn!!	Greetings, program...	You're alive!	Yeah, I... oops!
Flynn...  Where's Ram?	I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.	Wrote the...?	It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...	You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.	Then...	Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.	Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --	I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.	Stranger and stranger...
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master	All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
What about our friend - Sark?	Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here.	Not us, I hope.	Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs.
Did we make it?	Yes.
Hey... you guys OK?	How about you?	Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
A User -- in our world?	Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?	A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...	What's wrong with that area?
The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.	Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
There's another beam!	It's too far!
How did you do that, Flynn?	Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?	Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...
Flynn, we've got to help him!	Let's get some power here.
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.	Why? What are you going to do?	Jump.
But... won't you be de-rezzed?	Probably.
Flynn... you can't... I	Shhhhh.
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.	Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?	"You're a...""guest"" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games."	Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?	Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really	Yeah, yeah -- that's great.	How 'bout yourself?	Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...	Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!	Tron...?
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.	Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
Watch it!	Recognizers!
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...	The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?	"Well...my home ""sector"" was called Paramus ..."	PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.	It grows on you.
Feel what? You okay?	Alan-One...
What's goin' on?	We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --	Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...	Come here.
Hey... !	Little more juice's all it needs...
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.	We have to talk.	Good luck. You can't even think in here.
So...how's the world of serious science?	Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?	Whew. You never were much for small talk.  She still leave her clothes all over the floor?
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.	Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.	Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..	Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it...
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.	Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...	As long as we stay off the top floor, Dillinger'll never know we've been in here...
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?	Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.	Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?	You're getting out of the business?
Thank. you, Master Control.	We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?	Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?	Strategic Air Command.
Yes, MCP.	I've got a little challenge for you, Sark -- a new recruit. He's a tough case, but I want him treated in the usual manner. Train him for the games... let him hope for a while... and blow him away.	You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?	He's not any kind of program, Sark. He's a User.
A User?	That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...	Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece	But-what if I can't...?	You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
Wait...I need that...	Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...	End of line.
"I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays ""Happy Birthday"" to its User once a year."	Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --	Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.	We'll get them, sir... These things take time.	I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.
New guy...	Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?	The Users...you really think they're still there?	They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
What do you think?	Do it!
You think we can make it there?	We have to.
Do you know what he's talking about?	I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
Yori... hey...	Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...	That's all going to change, Yori...	How?	Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
My quarters.	Why is everything...like this?	It's a flat. But wait a micro...
You've grown, big program.	I had to...in the games...
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.	As long as it gets us out of here
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.	Then I owe you some thanks...
What is it?	Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!	We have to get off this beam!	I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
Nice...	It's something Users do.	Where's Flynn?
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.	"So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*"	Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.	I'm shocked.	Yeah.  You know Harry.
You bitch.	"Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*"	"Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep."	"Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion."
Helen!  It's your mystery man.	Simon?  Ohmygod.
Can you cover me for an hour?	Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.	Will you shutup.  I should never have told you about him.
Where are you going?	Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.	No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!	Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows we exist.
That's not true, honey--	It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.	Where are you going?	Out.
I'm done.	Where are you off to young lady?	I have a book report.
Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?	He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.	You seem fine now.	Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.	I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  You never used to lie to me.  But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
Dana, are you listening to me?	Yeah, Dad.	You know you can always talk to me.  Right?  Whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I'll understand.	Okay, Dad.	You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?	I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
How was school today?	Fine.
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.	Yeah, right.	You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?	Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Dad, how come you know the words?	Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.	Unbelievable!  Trent told me he wrote it.  He's history.
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.	Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
"And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her."	Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?	Uh huh.  Right here in river city.	You're kidding.	"She lives in Rome, but she does stuff here the Smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices				* here.										*"
"And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the					* ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front."	Okay.  Let's step up the surveillance on her.  Put on two more guys.
"Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes."	Roger, One.  Rolling.
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?	Yes.	So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!	Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
"They call him ""The Sand Spider"".				*"	Why?	"Probably because it sounds scary.				*"	This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy?	It's Talkradio.  You're on the air.
Harry!  Where are you!	In the helicopter.
Harry?  HARRY?!	What?
What's this for?	For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.	Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick me up at eight.  The de-brief is at ten hundred.
What a team.  See you at eight.	Yep.  Sleep fast.
Thanks dear.	Here, check these out.
Son of a bitch!	What?
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.	She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.	Yeah, but you're not her parents, anymore, you and Helen.  Her parents are Axl Rose and Madonna. The five minutes you spend a day with her can't compete with that kind of constant bombardment. You're outgunned, amigo.
"See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--"	Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?	Fourteen, Harry.	Right.  She's only fourteen.
"Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*"	No way.  Not Dana.
Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.	"Will you just open the door!					*"
Twenty here, fifty there... I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.	I thought you moved out.	Well .  .  .  I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement.  Don't change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks.
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.	Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.	In her dreams.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.	Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.	Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.	She could be moving money, guns. Anything.
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.	Yeah, right.
Station wagon?	Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
Helen's going to be pissed.	See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
What's the plan?	"Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*"
There's another guy, still in the car.	Stay on him.
Copy that.	And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --	Okay.  Here she comes.
Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.	Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
So, you wanna play huh?  You little--	That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.	Son of a bitch!	Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy?
Abu Kaleem Malik.	"Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*"
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.	You want me to just hang-- ?	Just hang a minute.	I'll just hang then, shall I?
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.	Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.	She's having an affair.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.	It can't be.  Not Helen.	Nobody believes it can happen to them.	It can't be.	Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?	I still don't believe it.	Relax.  Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her.  It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a --
Is this national security stuff boring you?	Put a tap on her phone.	What're you talking about?  We have that.	Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.	Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
Guy's a spook!	"Yeah, but for who?							*"	He could be working her to get to you.
Give me the page.	What are you talking about?	It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?	Aw, it's gotta be a typo--	GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
"She's still at my house.						*"	The purse is still at the house.
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--	You tell on me, I tell on you.	Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --	What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?	You know about that?
She's lying.	You didn't have sexual relations with him?
She could be telling the truth.	Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
Now what?	There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.	Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?	I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?	In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.	"Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?						*"
I thought this look like your work.	Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.	You're welcome.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--	... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.	Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--	Here they come.
Any minute now.	"It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash."
I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.	If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
He's got it.	Sorry.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.	But you didn't.  Why not?	I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?	No!  Never!	So, it was your first time.	I wasn't cheating!
My husband is a good man.	But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.	You're not going anywhere.
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?	Ten, Mr. Gibson.	And you still reach for your piece every time.	Yes sir.	God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.	Yes, sir.
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.	Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?	I adore it.
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.	I'd like that.
Well, what's the point of waiting?	I agree.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?	That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.	"Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going."
"Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested."	It's certainly... dramatic.	"Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins."	Is that why you got into this business?
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.	And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Yes.	Yes what?	Uh, yes, it is important.
Hello, Harry.	Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.	Oral hygiene?	Not exactly.
"You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*"	You're damaged goods, lady.
Did you tell her about us, Harry?	There is no us, you psychotic bitch.	Sure.  Say that now.
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?	Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.	Okay.
I'm late.	Me too.
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?	Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
That's fabulous Harry.	Yeah, it was wild.
Uh huh.  Okay.	It's not okay.  It's extortion.	What did you tell him?	I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.	Good thinking, honey.
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.	I'll handle it.
"Hi honey.  What's going on?					*"	"Sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you'll be home at eight.  I don't				* want Dana and I sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. You promise?"	Baby, I said I'd be there. Really.  Trust me.  Gotta go, honey.  Bye bye.
Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--	It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.	Yeah.  It was great.
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.	I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?	I couldn't believe it.  I go back to get this report I need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead I answer it--
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--	What'd you do, honey?	Well I pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server...
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.	It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.	Uh huh.	My husband the hero.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.	They must've just missed me.	They said you had to run out.	Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?	Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.	I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
How long have you been a member of his faction?	I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
What did happen?	Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
Why did you continue to see him?	He needed my help.	Not because you were attracted to him?	No.	You weren't attracted to him at all?	Well, maybe a little.
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.	Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.	Would you say he was boring, then?	Yeah.  I suppose he is.
That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?	You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs. Tasker, so I suggest you cooperate.  If we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?	He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.	And you agreed?	Yes.	Why?
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...	What did you need?	I needed to feel alive.  I wanted to do something...  outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed.  To be trusted.  To be special.
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?	No.
Let me out of her!  Right now!	Answer the question--
What?	Do you still love your husband?	Yes.	Louder please.	I love him.  I have always loved him and I will always love him.  Can I go home, please?
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--	Yes or no.	What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?	You will be contacted with the assignment.	My husband can't know about this.	No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?	I think so.	Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.	I can do it!	The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--	Natasha?	No.  Doris.
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?	What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.	Sure, hon.
Now slide the nylons off one by one.	I'm not wearing any.
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?	Let the hooker go.  She's not important.	Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle this.
What were you doing there?	You wouldn't believe me.
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--	I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.	Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where did I get this?
I'm sorry, honey.	Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!
What did he give you?	Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.	It makes you tell the truth?	Yes.	Is it working yet?	Ask me a question I would normally lie to.	Are we going to die?	"Yup.										*"
17 years.	My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?	I don't take those assignments.	What about Juno?	She's really a fox, isn't she?	Did you pork her Harry?	No.  But I wanted to.	Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?	Looks that way.
What is it?	God, you have great legs.	Harry... snap out of it!
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.	What?	Do you still love me?	Yes.	As much as you used to?	No.  Much more.
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?	"We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland."
What are you going to do?	Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
Oh shit.	Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.	I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
Not yet.  But we'll find him.	Dance?
What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?	Absolutely.
Let's face it, Harry, the Vette gets 'em wet.  But it's not enough.  If you want to really close escrow, you gotta have an angle.	And you've got one.	It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.	So what's your angle?	Sorry.  Trade secret.	Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.	So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.	Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.	Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?	Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.	Use 'em and lose 'em.	Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.	What about the husbands?	"Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?"	Those idiots.
You working on someone right now?	I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
What does she do?	Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?	Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?	Hey, slow down you're gonna miss the turn!
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?	Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
Yeeaoowww!!	You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?	Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My name's Simon.  Look, just let me go.  There's no need to kill me. I haven't seen your--
Beat it.	No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?	Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.	Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?	He said he was an American agent.
What?	Get going!	Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
Boris and Doris?	Go ahead.
Who's your little friend?	I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?	So now it's Tasker?  Not Renquist?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.	No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.	No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years--
What's going on, Harry?	Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.	Something you obviously have a hard time doing!	Hold that thought.
Like one?	Fuck you.
Hello?	Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?	Yes.  Go ahead.
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?	The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
Are you sure you weren't followed?	I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.	Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.	I understand.	It's my job to risk my life, but not yours.  I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.
"Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?"	"Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough."	"Worse than Cairo?							*"	"Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this."
Did you read the papers yesterday?	Yes.	"Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.  See-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running					* shootout, ending at the						* Marriot..."
That was you?!	You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
Tell me what happened?	I'm sorry, I can't.	You can trust me completely.	I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.	Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.	It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
"Were they trying to kill you?					*"	"Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again."	And you chased one?	"Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  ."
What is it you want me to do?	Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.	You'll call me then?	Yes.  Now go.
What's happened?	"It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*"
To our assignment.	What is it you need me to do?	Helen, I want you to be my wife.	I'm married!	Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.	We're going to Paris?	Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.	I don't know.  I have to think...	Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.	It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--	Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?	Helen.	You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.	I just glances inside.
It's a good thing you pay me well.	Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--	No.  He checked out okay--
What do you want me to do?	Find out who this Renquist it.	How?	Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
Who is this woman?	His wife.	His wife?  Good.  Bring them.
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.	Hello, Alabama.	I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.	Wait a minute -
Did you get the letter?	What letter?	What letter?
Gotten your mail yet?	Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.	Yes.
Not yet.	Nope.
Let me speak to Clarence.	He wants to speak with you.
"You're gonna be on ""T.J. Hooker""?"	Knock wood.
That was so good I am gonna have another.	You can't have just one.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.	This is great, we got cable.
You got that playing basketball?	Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.	Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.	Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
The forager's back.	Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.	I didn't get any chicken.	How come?	It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.	What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?	Oh, hush up.
Tell him we gotta go.	Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.	Don't eat anything.
The letter I sent.	The letter he sent.
Has he looked through it yet?	Ya looked through it?
Tell him to look through it.	Get it.
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.	He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
Bye-bye.	Now hang up.
"... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, ""Get her in here."". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go."	And here we are.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?	Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.	I'm the clumsiest person in the world.	It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.	What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You could have been a real dick.
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.	The oriental.	The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.	Want some Goobers?	Thanks a lot.	I thought Sonny was the good guy.	He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
Great movie. Action-packed!	Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?	Sonny kicks ass.	"You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the ""Streetfighter"". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R."	If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.	My name is Clarence, and what is yours?	Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.	Is that your real name? Really?	That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.	I took a cab.	You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?	Sure. Why not?	Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.	What time is it?	'Bout twelve.	I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?	No. Not particularly.  How come?	Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?	I love to get pie after a movie.	Would you like to get some pie?	I'd love some pie.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?	How 'bout me what?	Tell me about yourself.	There's nothing to tell.	C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?	What do you want to know?	Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
Ask me them again. One by one.	What do you do?	I don't remember.	Where are you from.	Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.	What's your favorite color?	I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.	What's your favorite movie star?	Burt Reynolds.	Would you like a bite of my pie?	Yes, I would.
Like it?	Very much. Now, where were we?	What kinda music do you like?	"Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like ""He's a Rebel""."	What are your turn-ons?	Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.	Turn-offs?	I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.	Do you have a fella?
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.	What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?	Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.	And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?	Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.
Wow. What a swell place to work.	Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.	How long have you worked here?	Almost four years.	That's a long time.	I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.	Do you get paid a lot?	"That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what ""Spiderman"" number one looks like?"	You bet. How much is that worth?
Four hundred bucks.	I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.	"Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" Lunch boxes. ""Green Hornet"" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here."
What's that?	"That's a ""Rookies"" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in ""The Black Hole""? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine."
God, Spiderman looks different.	He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?	Five.
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.	I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
You know when you sat behind me?	At the movies?	Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.	What would make you think that?	I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.	You're not stupid. Just wrong.
I love Janis.	You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.	She OD'd, didn't she?	Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.	You mean she got a bad batch?	"That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, ""Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it."" So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire."	So he really loved her?	Uh-huh.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?	You didn't do nothing.	Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?	Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.	What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.	I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
You're a whore?	I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.	"""Heroes For Sale""?"	Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.	Who?	I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.	That dazzling imagination.	"It's over on the TV. All it says is: ""Dear Clarence."" I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, ""Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."""	Who and what is a Drexl?	My pimp.	You have a pimp?	Uh-huh.	A real live pimp?	Uh-huh.	Is he black?	He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.	Is he nice?	Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.	What did he do to Arlene?	Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.	This motherfucker sounds charming!
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?	"At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in ""Dressed to Kill"". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date."	Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?	What?	Will you be my wife?
Yes.	You will?	You better not be fucking teasing me.	You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
"Did ya ever see ""The Chinese Professionals""?"	I don't believe so.	Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
I do.	Thank you.
Hello, Mrs. Worley.	How do you do, Mr. Worley?	Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.	Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?	Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.	Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
No no no no no no no no no...	Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
Where you goin', honey?	I just gotta get somethin'.
Sweetheart, write down your former address.	What?	Write down Drexl's address.	Why?	So I can go over there and pick up your things.	No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?	You don't know him -	You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.
Was it him or you?	"Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, ""If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it."" I could. So I did."	Is this a joke?	No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
I think what you did was...	What?	I think what you did...	What?	... was so romantic.
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?	Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?	Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.	I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.	You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.	I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.	Really?	With a vengeance, I hated them.	How come?	I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.	What?	Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun.
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.	You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.	I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?	Cancoon.	Why Cancoon?	"It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. ""Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon"". Don't 'cha think?"	But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.	It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.	That rhymes.
What the fuck are you talkin' about?	Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.	Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.	I heard that.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.	Heard that.
Damn skippy. He like it, too.	Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -	Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
I'm hip.	In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?	Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.	So you do eat pussy!	Naw naw!	You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!	Take that shit somewhere else.
What?	Can you live with it?	Live with what?	With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?	Yeah.	You wanna get unhaunted?	Yeah.	Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.	I can't believe what you're tellin' me.	I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.	You'd really do that?	He don't got no right to live.	Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.	I don't blame you.	If I thought I could get away with it -	Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.	I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.	All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.	Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.	"Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: ""I'll take that gun"", ""You'll have to""."	That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?	Are you kiddin'? He loves you.	You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?	You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.	"I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved ""Coming Home in a Body Bag""."	That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
Where the fuck is that bitch?	She's with me.	Who the fuck are you?	I'm her husband.	Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.	No thanks.	"No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, ""This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV."" See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties."
Wannabee nigger...	Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
Clarence?	You got it.	It's great to hear from you.	Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.	You comin' to L.A.? When?	Tomorrow.	What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.	Get the fuck outta here!	I'm a married man.	Get the fuck outta here!	Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half?
What?	Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Alabama, could you tell Clar -	Ask him if he got the letter.
Clarence sent a letter?	Has he gotten his mail today?
Money problems?	Now tell him goodbye.
That's a pretty amazing story.	Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?	Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.	You goin' out?	Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.	Good for you.	"What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for ""T.J. Hooker"" the other day."
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.	Did you meet Captain Kirk?	You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.
How much of that letter was on the up and up?	Every word of it.
You're really in love, aren't you?	For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
This shit can't be real.	It'll get ya high.
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!	I certainly hope so.	You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!	I know.	Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?	Tell me.	I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
This is Drexl's coke?	Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?	Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.	Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -	No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.	Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?	I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?	It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.	Is he big league?	He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.	What'd'ya tell 'em?	Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.	What's this acting class guy's name?	Elliot.	Elliot what?	Elliot Blitzer.	OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.	Where?	The zoo.	The zoo.  What are you waiting for?	Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?	What's to think about?	Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.	Two guys.	Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.	Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
Clarence...	Let me handle this.
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.	I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?
"I got the part on ""T.J. Hooker""."	No shit? Dick, that's great!
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.	Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
Clarence.	Yeah?	Um, nothing, let's go?
What the fuck did you bring that for.	In case.	In case of what?	In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?	Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -	I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
Do you really mean it?	No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
"Now's a helluva time to play ""what if""."	"This is our last chance to play ""what if"". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught."
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.	Yeah, let's just get outta here.
No. But thanks.	No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
I'd fuck Elvis.	Really?	When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.	I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?	How 'bout me what?	How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?	What are we gonna see?	"A Donny Chiba triple feature. ""The Streetfighter"", ""Return of the Streetfighter"", and ""Sister Streetfighter""."	Who's Sonny Chiba?	He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.	You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?	Three kung fu movies.
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -	Want an animal cracker?	Yeah, OK.
Leave the gorillas.	- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -	Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.	Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?	Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -	Look, Dick, I don't -	No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.	What department?	What do you think, eightball?	The police department?	Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.	He trusts you?	We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.	Sure. I didn't hear anything.
What?	Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?	No. No, you don't.	Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.	Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
He wants to talk ya.	Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.	No problems on both counts.
Where's everybody else?	They'll be along.
Well, I guess it's about that time.	I guess so. Follow me.
Elliot.	Yeah?	Get on your knees.
Don't you?	No.	Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!
Say it, goddamn it!	You are the dumbest person in the world.	Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.	No. No you're not.	What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.	Have you read the story on Elvis?	No. Not yet.	You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.	That good, huh?
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.	I can see what you mean.	Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.
"I don't know, Clarence, ""Doctor Zhivago"" is a pretty big movie."	The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.	"Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is ""Doctor Zhivago"". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine."
"Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to ""Doctor Zhivago"" are in arbitration?"	I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
"Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these ""Soldier of Fortune"" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table."	I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -	Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.	"OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you ""Coming Home in a Body Bag"" is one of my favorite movies. After ""Apocalypse Now"" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever."	Thank you very much, Clarence.	"You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. ""Sophie's Choice"", ""Ordinary People"", ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", ""Gandhi"". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit."	I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.	Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.	Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.	Me too, Boris.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?	I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
Where'd you go?	A Norms in Van Nuys.	Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.	Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.	Why does he trust you?	We grew up together.	If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?	I bullshitted him.
Wanna count your money?	Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.	Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?	I can, but I don't.	That's about all I ever eat.
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?	Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.	Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?
I'm really not very -	You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?	I really don't know.	You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?	She seems very nice.	Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -	Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?	Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.	You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this -  - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
What do you want from me?	What?	Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?	Do you still have friends on the force?	Yes, I still have friends on the force.	Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?	What makes you think I could do that?	You were a cop.	What makes you think I would do that?	I'm your son.	You got it all worked out, don't you?	"Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always ""OK"", ""No problem"", ""You're a busy guy, I understand"". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems."
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.	Do tell. Why drug related?	Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.	No shit?	Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?	Nope.	If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.	Who is he?	Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.	That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?	Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.	I got some money I can give you -	Keep it.	Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.	We do make a cute couple, don't we?	Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?	I give up. Who are you?	I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?	I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.	I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?	No.	I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.	Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
I've seen him.	Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.	What are you talkin' about?	I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.	I don't believe you.	That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?	On their honeymoon.	I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?	They didn't tell me.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?	Sure.
Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?	Uh-huh.	You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers.
Come again?	It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.	What about him?	Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.	Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?	Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?	McTeague.	I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?	I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?	You and Robin moved?	Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
I'm me... I mean, that's me.	Step inside.
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.	Where'd you come from?	I don't know. He just appeared as magic.	Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
That was very good.	Thank you.	If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?	Sure. No problem.	Could we try it now?	Absolutely.
Where'd he come from?	I don't know. He just appeared as magic.	Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?	Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
That Vietnam movie?	Uh-huh.	That was a good fuckin' movie.	Sure was.	Do you believe him?	I believe he believes him.
He'll wear a wire?	We talked him into it.	Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.	Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -	Not a tiny little vial -	But a fuckin' baggie.	No don't sit here and feed us some shit.	You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -	You're no longer an extra -	Or a bit player -	Or a supporting actor -	You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -	But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -	And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.	'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -	That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -	Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
Nicholson and I.	Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.	Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.	So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
Suspect's words -	To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.	"He produced ""Coming Home in a Body Bag""."
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.	This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.	We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.	So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.
You do more than try.	You do.	Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.
He knows.	How the fuck could he know?	He saw the wire.	How's he supposed to see the wire?	He knows something's up.
We gotta get him outta there.	Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.	This guy's gonna kill him.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.	You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
What was I sayin'?	Rock whores.	You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.	Pussy love pink rocks.
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?	Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.  I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.  He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?	Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.	Shit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a nigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?	I'm tryin' to find my jacket.	Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately.
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.	Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.	That's bullshit.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.	Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
Preach on, Big D.	Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -	- Because it's good!	Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere.
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!	"Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say ""Bitch, suck my dick!"" and then Jayne Kennedy says, ""First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!"" Now, what do you say?"	"I tell Jayne Kennedy, ""Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!"""
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?	If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.	With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please.
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me.	What can I do?
You gotta hold this for me.	You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.	Just put it in your purse.	I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.	They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.	No way, JosÈ.	Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.	I'm not wearing a bra.	Put it in your pants.	No.	You're the one who wanted to drive fast.	Read my lips.
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?	Naw, he ain't home right now.	Do you live here?	Yeah, I live here.	Sorta room-mates?	Exactly room-mates.	Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?	Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.	How do you know? You been there?	No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.	You're right. It is.
Yes.	Are you Dick Ritchie?	No.	Do you know a Clarence Worley?	Yes.	Do you know where we can find him?	He's at the Beverly Wilshire.	Where's that?	Well, you go down Beechwood...
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?	No.	Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?	I didn't mean -	Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.
What was the Jew-boy's name?	Donowitz, he said.
We want you to tell us about last night.	I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
Wake up, Cole.	Uh, I didn't hear the...
No, sir!	We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
Well?	Uh, what?
Him?  You saw that man?	Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
Women will want to get to know you...	"I DON'T WANT YOUR ""WOMEN,"" YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!"
"The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become ""addicted"" have you, Cole?  To that ""dying"" world'"	No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
"You said we weren't ""real,"" Cole..."	"Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it...""dimensions."" It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not."
I understand.  There'd be no point.	We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
To be determined by the proper authorities.	You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
"We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with ""unstable"" types."	For a man in your position...an opportunity.
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.	Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.	You're still a little... disoriented.
We're very close!  Because of you!	This is it, James...what you've been working for.
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.	Shut up!
That's him.	What are you going to do with us?
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who was with the guy who tied us up.	What's she doing?	She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.	Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
It's important to observe everything.	I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
They forced me to take drugs.	Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?	I got into trouble.  I got arrested. But I still got you a specimen -- a spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to put it, so I ate it.  It was the wrong year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?	It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.	And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.	Meaning...???	That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.	And your only goal is...???	To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.	So that...???	Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?	I need to go now.	"I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you ""James""?"	"""James""!  Nobody ever calls me that."	Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?	No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.	What kind of information?	It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.	Change what?	I need to go.	Do you know why you're here, James.	Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.	I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?	They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.	You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?	No.	Why not?  Most people have some ID.	You wouldn't understand.	You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?	I have to go.	A jail?  Prison?	Underground.	Hiding?	I love this air.  This is wonderful air.	What's wonderful about the air, James?	It's so clean.  No germs.	You're afraid of germs?	I have to go.	Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?	This is April, right?	July.	July?!	Do you know what year it is?	What year is it?	What year do you think it is?	1995?	You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?	No, 1995 is the past.	1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.	Perhaps it was a wrong number...	No.  That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things.
James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore?	What?	I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?	Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
It's just a shot to calm you.	No more drugs.  Please...	I have to do this, James.  You're very confused.
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.	1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?	You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?	Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?	It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
"You used to call me ""James""."	You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.	Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...
"""Never cry wolf!"""	What?	"My father told me that.  ""Never cry wolf.""  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens."	"""If something really happens""...like what, James?"	Something bad.  Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff...
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?	Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.	We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?	About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.	And I was in it?  What did I do?	You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.	It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.	You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.	Clues?  What kind of clues?	A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.	What will you do...when you find this...secret army?	I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates.  So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure.  So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth.
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?	When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.	What do you mean -- when you were a kid?	Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!	"I'm not going to ""do"" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is."
They're keeping an eye on me.	Who's keeping an eye on you?	The man...with the voice.  I recognized him.  He's from the present.  He...
Are you hurt?	Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!	I did him a favor.  Now come on.
You didn't have a gun before, did you?	I've got one now.
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!	James, why don't we...?	Lock it now!
Mason???	Jeffrey Mason?
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?	You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
The guy was a total fruitcake.	And he told you then his father was a famous virologist.
We need gas.	I thought you didn't know how to drive.	I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.	What's the matter with your leg?	I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.	Shot!  Who shot you?	It was some kind of...war.  Never mind, you wouldn't believe me.  Turn off here.
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?	No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.	That has your name on it.  Give him cash.
You smell so good.	You have to give yourself up, you know.
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?	No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.	See -- you can drive after all!	Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
What made you think that?	Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?	Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.	"I'm...""mentally divergent"".  I would love to believe that."	It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you.
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.	First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?	It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.	Give me the gun.	The gun! ... I lost it	You're sure?	No gun!  Stars!  Air!  I can live here.  Breathe!
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...	No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
I don't understand what we're doing.	We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.	You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them.
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?	I thought I was in...prison again.	Just like that?  You were in prison?	No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.	You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?	I don't know -- I don't remember.	The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?	It was?  I didn't...know.	James, you said he was hiding in the barn...	I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...	IT WASN'T A TV SHOW!  IT WAS REAL!
What does this mean to you?	...I had a dream about...something like that.	You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?	You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...	Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying to.  I can't believe that everything we do or say has already happened, that we can't change what's going to happen, that I'm one of the three billion people who are going to die...soon.
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.	James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
You want me to rob him?	I...I...We need cash, James.
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...	A Carpet Cleaning Company?	No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.	You... you left them a message?	I couldn't resist.  I was so relieved. Wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
You... you couldn't have heard me.	They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.	Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.	I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.	If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.	Flowers!  What flowers?
Why are we doing this?	So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe you're wrong.  Maybe we're both crazy.	In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.	Well, you look pretty different, too.	I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.	I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!	"On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, ""We did it."""
I know this place! ... This is my dream.	Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.	I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.	James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!	Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.	I'll get the tickets and meet you... in the Gift Shop.
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?	No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.	Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?	Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.	So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?	"No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, ""voice mail"".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present."
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.	I need to make a telephone call.	A telephone call?  That's communication with the outside world!  Doctor's discretion.  Hey, if alla these nuts could just make phone calls, it could spread.  Insanity oozing through telephone cables, oozing into the ears of all those poor sane people, infecting them!  Whackos everywhere!  A plague of madness.  In fact, very few of us here are actually mentally ill.  I'm not saying you're not mentally ill, for all I know you're crazy as a loon.  But that's not why you're here.  Why you're here is because of the system, because of the economy.  There's the TV.  It's all right there. Commercials.  We are not productive anymore, they don't need us to make things anymore, it's all automated.  What are we for then?  We're consumers.  Okay, buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen. But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you know what?  You're mentally ill! That's a fact!  If you don't buy things...toilet paper, new cars, computerized blenders, electrically operated sexual devices...  SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE- ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...
Germs?!	"In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible ""bad things"" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?...""germs""!"
"""What about the germs?""  I say.  He goes, ""I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!"" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?"	I'm not crazy.	Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?	If you know how to escape, why don't you...?	Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.	What's that mean?	I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS! TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...
They hurt you!	Not as bad as what they're doing to kitty.
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!	"Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about ""you know what""."	What are you talking about???	You know -- your plan.
What're you writing?  You a reporter?	It's private.	A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?
What....???	Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.	What...???	"Not, ""what"", babe!  When!"
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.	You do know me.  You helped me once.	That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.	I'm here about some monkeys.
Excuse me -- what did you say?	Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
"County Hospital, right?  1989.  The ""Immaculate Escape"" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too."	Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...	We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?	I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.	I get it!  This is your old plan, right?	Plan?  What are you talking about?	"Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, ""Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?""  You do remember that, don't you?"	Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!	"And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, ""Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"""	Listen, you dumb fuck!  The thing mutates We live underground!  The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats.  We're like moles or worms.  All we want to do is study the original...
JOSE!	Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
Jo...Jose????	Pulling out the tooth, man, that was nuts!  Here, take this.
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!	How did you find me?	The phone call, man.  The phone call.	The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?	"Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago! Yes, that phone call.  I been in training for this a couple a months now -- ever since I got back from that... ""weird"" war we were in.  You remember that?  Here, take it, man!  You could still be a hero if you'd cooperate!"
This part isn't about the virus, is it?	Hey, man...	It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.	They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?	Who am I supposed to shoot?
I mashed the spider, didn't I?	We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
I asked you, why did you volunteer?	Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
Uh, that message...me?	It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?	I couldn't call!  You sent me to the wrong year!  It was 1989.
But you know what's real now?	Yes, sir.
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.	I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...	He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?	Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...	Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.	I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?	You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
He was fully sedated!	Then are you trying to tell me that a fully sedated, fully restrained patient somehow slipped out that vent, replaced the grill behind him and that he's wriggling through the ventilation system right now?
He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress.	For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!	Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.	"And what we believe is what's accepted as ""truth"" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith."
What...virus?	She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.	What virus are we talking about, Dad?	You're insane, Jeffrey.	"You ""develop"" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever ""developed"" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!"	Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.	THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT!  YOU'RE OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY. GOT THAT?  NOW -- WHAT FUCKING VIRUS HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED FUCKING MANIAC?
One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?	You really want to know?	No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.	"Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, ""your psychiatrist""?"	Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?	That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
"WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous ""pretend-friend-to- animals""?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!"	Then how come she knows what's going on?
-- so they get there and they ask the guy real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets agitated, starts screaming about viruses. Totally irrational, totally disoriented, doesn't know where he is, what day it is, alla that stuff.  All they got was his name.  They figure he's stoned out of his mind, it's some kinda psychotic episode, so they're gonna bring him...	He's been tested for drugs?	Negative for drugs.  But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?
You have him in restraints.	Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.	You want to go in?  Examine him?	Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...	James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?	No, thank you.	I'll be right here...just in case.
Nine thirty	Might be tight.	Tight?  My watch says 7:30.	On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.	What?  What did you say?	Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
Hey!  You there!	You want something, old man?	Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?	You want something?	Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.	You can't do that yourself?	Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?	I'm sorry, I didn't--	What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?	I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.	I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?	Christ no!	Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.	I said I was sorry.	Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.	Yeah, sure.  You got change?	Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?	All right, old man.  Christ.
Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.	Yeah, yeah.
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.	Christ!
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.	That's 'cause he's dead.
Oh, Jesus.	I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?	What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?	He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?	He no!	See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . .
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.	Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.	That a fact?	I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.	Maybe I do.	Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.	I think I've heard that before.	What do you want for free?	You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.	That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.	Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.	Think you'll live that long?
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?	I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.	I won't hold my breath.
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.	Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.	You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.	Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.	You afraid of the dark?	Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.	You don't fear death?	We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.	We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?	More or less.	Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.	We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.	No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.	Same back at you.
Any parting words of wisdom?	Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself; is it worth it?
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.	Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?	Nothing.	You want to make a kiddies bet?	I'll bet my watch against your pay.
It's a Movado.	Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?	Next city you're in take it to a jeweler.  He won't give you less than four-hundred for it.
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?	That's my morning's pay.	I'm a rich man off of thirty bucks?
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.	Hundred and eight already.
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.	Will be.	You ain't nothing but an old fool.	You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
It's nonsense.	It is not.	A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.	It will.	No it won't.  You just don't know shit about statistics.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?	I got more brains than you've got teeth.	Put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is.  I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
Can I help you, sir?	I need a ticket.	Where to?	Out of here.	But, in particular?	I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.	Where in Mexico would you like--	I don't care, just get me there.
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.	How much.	One way, or round trip?	One way.	Thirty even.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.	The ticket is thirty dollars.	I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.	I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.	Yeah.  Just a little short. Figures.  I just wanted to get out, that's all.
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.	I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
You want somethin'?	You Harlin?	Nope.  Darrell.	Harlin around?	He's up at the Look Out.
Will he be back soon?	Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.	You own this place?	Yep.	Then why do you call it Harlin's?	'Cause Harlin used to own it.	But he's dead.	So?
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--	Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today.
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--	Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.	I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?	Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?	If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?	Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?	Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Hey!	Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.	How much time?	Time.	What time is it now?	Twenty-after-ten.	Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.	Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
Accident.	You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--	Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?	Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.	I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?	Just a car.
Hey.	Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.	Nothing.	Don't look like nothing.	Just banged my head.  It was an accident.	Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Look, I just want to pick up my car.	She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.	How much?	Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.	How much!?	Hundred-fifty.	To replace a God damn radiator hose!?	A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?	About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.	That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?	That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?	That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.	What's that got to do with the radiator hose?	I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.	It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.	Then you ain't gonna have the car.	Listen, man.  I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had.
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.	I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.	Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.	You son of a bitch!	Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my hundred-forty-five dollars.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.	Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.	One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?	You've been there?	Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.	You believe that?	You think bad, and bad is what you get.	That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.	No charge.	Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--	Two-hundred.	What?	It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.	You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.	Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.	I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.	Yeah, but it was shot.	I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.	Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.	What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.	Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.	Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.	Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.	I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!	You listen to me, you fancy city man.  You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it. And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on her.  Now get out of here!  You're stinking up my garage.
No!	What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.	Please, just leave the car alone.	Yeah, you better remember that.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!	There you go, sweet talking me again.
What you want?	Open up!	We're closed.  Come back in the morning.	It is morning.	Come back when the sun comes up.
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?	I want my car.	You got the money?
Two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.	What's it to you?	I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.	Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?	You got beer?	What would a truck stop be without beer?	Let me have a Beck's.	We ain't got no Beck's.	Kirin?	No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.	Genuine Draft?	No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?	Yeah, give me the Miller.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.	Yeah, I'll try.
What was that all about?	You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.	More like Jenny is after every man she sees.	You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
Poor thing.  Is she all right?	'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.	Baby didn't die.  Just froze off all it's finger and toes.  Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  Now she died.
Let me get your change.	Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?	I think I burned my gun hand!	It'd serve you right.  Jose, run get a mop and clean this mess up.
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?	Yes.  Yes it is.	Taking a little trip?	I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.	Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?	I . . .
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?	John . . .
Is that the way you want it, boy?  A bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  Ends like this and you won't be able to spend a dime of that blood money.	He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
For the love of God would you two give it a rest?  Lord almighty.  In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic.  How far did you think you were going to get with this?  Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  Now use what little smarts you got.  If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.	What do you want?	Same thing you want.  I want to be out of Sierra; to be able to do as I please.  But that takes money.
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?	Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.	Can't I?  You're out in the desert, all alone, with a body in your trunk.  What do you think, boy?
There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.	John--
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.	Sheriff Potter.
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.	Who the hell is this!?
Who was that on the phone?	Wrong number.	You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?
I put up new drapes, Jake.	I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?	You never said anything.  About the drapes.	They look nice.	You haven't even looked at them once.
They look nice.	I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.	Uh-huh
What the hell you looking at, girl?	Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
What's the matter?	You didn't hear something?	How could I?  I was sleeping.	There's someone in the house.	I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.	The wind isn't blowing.
Jake, what is that?	What does it look like?	When did you buy a gun?
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.	What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.	Jake.  No.  No!
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?	I'm just going to my car.	That's right on my way.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.	My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?	Do you have to call me that?	I don't know your real name.	Maybe I don't want you to.	Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.	You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?	My cup runneth over, beauti--	It's Grace.	May I carry your package, Grace?
Jesus.	You sure you can manage?	I got it.	Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
No, I've got it.	What happened to your hand?	Accident.	You should be more careful.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.	No trouble at all, really.
Wasn't nothing.	Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.	That's all right.  I got it.
It's nothing.  Really.	I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.	That a fact?	I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?	Yes, I have.	'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.	I . . . can't . . . argue . . .
Thank you, John.	You're welcome, Grace.	You're not from around here, are you?	Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?	You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.	I just drove in this morning.	Drove into Sierra?  What for?	Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.	Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.	Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.	Least you can leave.	Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.	And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
Where you coming from?	All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.	You've been around.	I guess I've got wander in my blood.	Where you headed?	I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.	You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.	If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.	What happens if you lose?	I pack up and go somewhere else.	Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.	I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.	I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.	I didn't say it bothered me.	Did you like it; me watching you?	I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.	Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Nice place you got here.	Thank you.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.	I guess it must.	What do you do anyway?	A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.	Where'd you learn to do that?	From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.	A medicine man?	Those are white words, not ours.	Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.	Come here.
My face tell you all that?	It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?	The same thing you do.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.	What?	Lift me down.
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.	Like you.	Beautiful?	Like they're made of polyester.	I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.	Nothing like a little liveliness.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?	I have ideas.	Such as?
All right, Grace.  No more games.	Games?	You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.	Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.	Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.	I'm just flesh and blood, baby. That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my fortune.  Thanks for the lemonade.
You never did answer my question.	Still playing?	That's not an answer.  What is it you want?	You know what I want.	Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.	If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
Doesn't the heat bother you?	Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.	You love him?	No.	Did you ever?	Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?	I'm guessing no.	Yeah, I guess you're right.	And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.	I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.	You could just leave him.	I don't know how.	You just walk away.	It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.	You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.	Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.	Whatever it takes.
How far is it to California?	From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.	Have you ever been there before?	Yeah.	Is it pretty?	Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.	Take me with you.	I can't.	Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.	Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.	I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.	Where?	Jake.	You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?	He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.	From?	He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.	You live pretty good.	Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.	How much money has he got?	Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.	One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.	Lied?  What do you mean?	I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--	It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.	If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .	We'd have to kill him.
John?  John where are you going?	I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.	John, please--	I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.	What are you talking about?	Kill someone.  I can't do it.	Is it so bad?  It would be quick. He wouldn't even have to feel it.
Shit!	It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.	Jesus Christ!  Listen to yourself! I can't do it, Grace.  I can't do it.
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?	I wanted to talk.	I don't think we have anything to talk about.	What about us?	There is no us, remember?	Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.	I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.	Stop it.	Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?	Because I know you're full of shit.	I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.	I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.	I could if I had Jake's money.	Is that what changed your mind?  The money?	I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.	Are you sure?  About me, I mean?	I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.	The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.	You said you couldn't kill anybody.	We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
Grace . . . Grace?	After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
Why the hell didn't you do anything?	What was I supposed to do?	You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls.
Where's the safe?	I don't know.	You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?	I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.	Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!	Don't yell at me!
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.	There has to be!	There isn't!  There's nothing under here but more floor.  Jesus fucking Christ!  We killed a man for nothing but floor.
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.	This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.	If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?	You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?	Don't yell at me!  I know it's here! I know it!
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.	I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
If you want.	We're going all the way.  Together.
Let's go in the bedroom.	No.
Let's do it here.	What about him?	Let him watch.  I want him to know what he's missing.
You got a suitcase?	Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.	Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.	Where are you going?	To get my car.	Wait.  What about . . . him?	Put some clothes on him.  When I get back We'll load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert.  It'll takes days for anybody to find him.
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?	I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.	I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.	Yeah.  Good thinking.	Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.	Funny thing.
John . . .?	Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.	You liar!  You wanted him dead.  You seduced me into killing him!
One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.	Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.	No, you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so I could go to a hanging alone.
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.	Not me.  Us.	It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.	Give him the money.	What?	You heard me.  Count it out.	He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.	He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
I shot him.	You killed him!	He was going to take the money.	Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.	It's our money.  He had no right to take it.
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?	Just drive.
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?	He was going to--	I know.  He was to take the fucking money.	You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?	You killed a man for no reason!
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?	You could give me the gun.
Well, nothing.	Now what?	Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.	But you said we could be together.	Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.	What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.	<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.	He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.	The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.	But I want to say with you,	Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.	I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?	I think you're a lying, back stabbing bitch.  But it's nice to know you care.
John!	Grace!
Are you all right?	I think I busted my leg.	Can you climb back up.
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?	I'm here.	Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.	I'll get it.
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?	Where the hell am I going to go?	John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
John, throw me the keys.	What for?	The trunk.  It's locked.	It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.	It's . . . it's locked.	You closed it, didn't you, Grace?	I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.	Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.	No.  I swear it.	And you're not one to lie, are you?	Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.	Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.	Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?	Someone will find me.	Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.	You idiot!  You'll kill us both!	At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?	For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!	What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.	Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?
Who the hell are you?	I'm her husband.	Husband . . .?	Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.	I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.	Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.	I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.	A lot that means.	Grace, tell him.
I have half a mind to--	Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
What happened to your hand?	Accident.	You've got to be--	Yeah, I know.  More careful.	I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.	Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.	I'm a solid man.	John Stewart.	What brings you to Sierra?	My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.	Where you headed?	I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.	Live there?	Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.	You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.	I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--	It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.	Wait a second--	Ah, I can smell it on you.
Hey!	That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.	Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.	Like you don't know.	Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
Would you?	Would I what?	Would you kill her?
Why would I kill her?	Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.	How do you know if you've never tried?	This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
Good Lord.  What happened to you?	Just ran into a little trouble.	Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?	No.	Hungry?	No.	I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.	I had a problem getting my car back.	You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
Nice office you've got.	I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.	Isn't that illegal?
Now what can I do for you?	I was hoping we could talk.	Talk?  About what?	About things.  About your wife.	Sweet Grace?  What about her?	About what you said this morning.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.	I do.	You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.	I did?	Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.	I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.	I'm not rambling.	You're talking like a mad man.	You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.	That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.	Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.	A man doesn't always mean the things he says.	You meant it.	What makes you say that?	Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.	And what does that make you?	The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.	This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.	And for that you'd kill Grace?	For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.	Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.	How do you put a price on murder?	I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?	Make it twenty.	Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.	How much could you get?	Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.	I need thirteen.	That's a bit much.	You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.	I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.	Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.	Do we shake hands?	If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife . . .?
I guess I might as well get this done with.	The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.	What should I do?	How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.	You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.	Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.	And tell her what?
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .	Is the job done?	No.	You didn't kill her?	The time wasn't right.	You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.	You know what I mean.	I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?	You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?	I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.	You love her, but you hate her?	I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.	Shut up.	Came close this time and it scares you.	Drop it, Jake.	And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.	SHUT UP!
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?	Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?	You think that's a lot of money?	All I have in the world.	That's what I like about you, Jake. You're an honest man.
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.	No.
Yeah, well, me too.	Trouble with the car again?	You could say.  I don't even have it yet.	Darrell giving you problems?	He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.	Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.	It's not like that.	Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.	Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--	You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.	Jake--	And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.	That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.	There's another reason?  It better be good.	I came for Grace.	You came to take my wife from me?	I came to kill her.	Liar.	It's the truth, Jake.	That's a thick change of heart.	Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.	That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.	Damn it, Jake.  If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me.  And if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two- hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money.  I've got to have the money.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.	Wh . . . what are you talking about?	This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.	Come on, Jake--	Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.	Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.	Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.	Christ, Jake, please--	Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?	You're not talking sense.	Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.	What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.	A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.	What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.	You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.	I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.	Not from where I stand.	It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.	What are you babbling about?	Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.	You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.	Two-hundred dollars.	Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
I asked you a question.	Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.	You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to ask you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.	Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
I want to stay.	I said come on!
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!	You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?	What?	I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
What happened to your hand?	Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.	Got any requests?	That country shit all sounds the same to me.	How about I pick one out for you?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.	She's dead.	Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?	I've had time to get over it.	You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?	Oz.	You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.	You're too quick for me.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.	For what?	For defending my honor this afternoon.	I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.	But you was going to fight for me.	I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.	He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.	Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.	That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.	How old are you?	Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.	No, I don't want to take you for a ride.  What I want is for . . . Hey, you don't happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars I could--
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.	What the hell are you talking about?	What's your name anyway?
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.	Will you shut up!
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.	Get away from me!
I wasn't doing anything.	That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.	Make time?  Is everybody in this town slap happy?
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.	You expect me to believe that?	I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.	Mister, I'm calling you out.	What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
You're fucked.	You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?	They're not very imaginative?	'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.	Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.	Not before I settle with you.	Christ, I don't believe this.	Stand up.	I wasn't hitting on your girl!	Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Mister!	Oh, shit!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.	I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.	Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.	What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?	I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.	You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!	My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.  Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
Now, what's this?	Give it to me!	Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?	I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!	This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
Nooo!	I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
John, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.	I know, Mr. Vesci.  I know.  I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had.  You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.	You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.	Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.	No.  He gets shot by the old lady.	The old lady?	With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?	You're the gambler.  You tell me.	I had to beat it before the cops showed up.  I don't have a cent to my name.  I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mr. Vesci, if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have any at all.  So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car.  I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.	A hundred-forty-five really.	A hundred and . . . Now you listen to me you deadbeat, little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and I want it.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
Do you understand me you little fuck?	Yes, Mr. Vesci.	And John, don't make me come look for you.
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.	Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
Kids.	Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.	He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.	What happened?	His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.	Jesus!	Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.	I guess.	Like I said; you really can't blame the boy.  Some people don't know how to avoid trouble.  Know what I mean?
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.	No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.	Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.	Not as bad as it looks.	There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.	Wouldn't know anything about it.	That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.	Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.	Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.	Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.	Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.	Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.	Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -	Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.	Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?	Nope.  No problems up the road.
Why don't you step out of the car, son?	I don't understand what the--	Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.	Sure, Sheriff.
Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.	What for?	I think you might just want to do as I say.	There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.	And as soon as I see that you're on your way.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!	Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.	I didn't do anything.	Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something.  He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him.  And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did.  I was there.  Like I said; I been watching you.
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.	Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?	Thirty-thousand dollars.	You ain't passing these test, son. If I can't trust you I'm gonna have to arrest you . . .
Nobody's going to hang.  We're all gonna walk away with a little something.  I ain't a greedy man. And, hell, you did all the work. One-hundred-thousand dollars.  Split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  Give or take.	And you're taking?
Got any cold soda?	Eh?	Soda.  You got any soda?	Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.	Soda.  You know.
I call the policia.	No!
No police.	But, Senor--	No police!  Wait until I'm gone.	Senor, you need a doctor.	No police!
Hey!  You there!	You want something, old man?	Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?	You want something?	Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.	You can't do that yourself?	Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?	I'm sorry, I didn't--	What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?	I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.	I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?	Christ no!	Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.	I said I was sorry.	Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.	Yeah, sure.  You got change?	Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?	All right, old man.  Christ.
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.	Christ!
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.	That's 'cause he's dead.
Oh, Jesus.	I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?	What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?	He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?	Hell no!	See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.	Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.	That a fact?
Maybe I do.	Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.	I think I've heard that before.	What do you want for free?	You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.	Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.	What?	...And everything is nothing too.
Cocksucker motherfucker! Cops. I hear you. Always sneaking around. Thinks I can't see him. Well he's right. Motherfucker. But that ain't mean I don't know what's going on around here. They're all cursed. Yes sir.	Who's cursed?	All them miners last century. Hungry ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at the mine. Earth ran red with blood, think I'm fooling around here. White sky was on fire. Grown men cried like babies. I saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I cursed them. White people can't seem to stay away from Indians . You gotta watch where ya put your fingers. Pussy pussy pussy, Indian pussy.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?	So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.	Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.	"Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that ""om""! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, ""the more you eat, the more you want....""..."	I got things to do.
...But ain't you got a little something for the infirm?	I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.	Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.	Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.	Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.	You afraid of the dark?	Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.	So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?	More or less.	Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.	Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.	No and I don't plan on sticking around either.	Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.	You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?	Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.	You know I won't be seeing you.
I wasn't doing anything.	That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.	Make time?  Is everybody in this town on drugs?
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.	You expect me to believe that?	I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.	Mister, I'm calling you out.	What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?	'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.	Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?	Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!	Christ, I don't believe this!	Stand up.	I wasn't hitting on your girl!	Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Mister!	Oh, shit!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.	I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.	Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.	You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!	My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
Now, what's this?	Give it to me!	Mexico?  You going to Mexico?	I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!	This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me.
Who the hell is this!?	Who the hell are you?	I'm her husband.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.	Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.	Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.	I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.	A lot that means.	Grace, tell him.
You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!	You broke my nose!	It ain't broke.
What the fuck do you want?	I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.	Yeah...	Say, what happened to your hand?	Accident.	You've got to be--	Yeah, I know.  More careful.	I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.	That's a solid name.	I'm a solid man.	Bobby Cooper.	"""Bobby Cooper."" What brings you to Superior, Coop?"	An overheated car.	Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?	Darrell's a moron.
California...	Live there?	Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.	You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.	I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--	It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.	Wait a second--	Ah, I can smell it on you.
Hey!	That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.	Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
"""You can't shoot 'em!"" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you."	Like you don't know.	Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
Would you?	Would I what?	Would you kill her?
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.	How do you know if you've never tried?	This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
What can I do for you, lad?	I was hoping we could talk.	Talk?  About what?	About things.  About your wife.	Sweet Grace?  What about her?	About what you said this morning.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.	I do.	You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.	I did?	Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.	Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.	I'm not rambling.	You're talking like a madman.	Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.	Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.	Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.	A man doesn't always mean the things he says.	You meant it.	What makes you say that?	Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.	And what does that make you?	The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you...  You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.	You love her, but you hate her?	"No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little ""games"" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?"
How much could you get?	Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.	I need thirteen.	That's a bit much.	We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.	I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.	Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead...  Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.	How do you want it?	How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.	You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.	Be quiet, boy.  I got to figure this thing. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be...
Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?	Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.	And tell her what?
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.	I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
Next time you'll do just fine.	No!
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!	I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
"I guess this is what they call ""ironee""? Hunh?"	It's not what you think, Jake.	No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!	Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...	...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...
I came for Grace.	You came to take my wife from me?
Shhh! Liar.	It's the truth, Jake.	That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.	Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.	You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.	Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?	What are you talking about!
Come on, Jake --	Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.	You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.	Two-hundred dollars?	Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?	What?	I wanna play a song on the juke.  You got a quarter?
What happened to your hand?	I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.	Got any requests?	That country shit all sounds the same to me.	How about I pick one out for you?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.	Cause she's dead.	Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?	I've had time to get over it.	You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?	Oz.	You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.	You're too quick for me.
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.	For what?	For defending my honor this afternoon.	I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.	But you was going to fight for me.	I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.	He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.	Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.	That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.	How old are you?	Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.	No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.	What the hell are you talking about?	What's your name anyway?
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.	Will you shut up!
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.	Get away from me!
You Harlin?	Nope.  Darrell.	Harlin around?	He's up at the Look Out.
Will he be back soon?	Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.	You own this place?	Yep.	Then why do you call it Harlin's?	'Cause Harlin used to own it.	But he's dead.	So?
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--	Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.	Darrell--	OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
So?	It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.	I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?	Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?	If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?	Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...	Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?	Yeah, I can fix it.	Great!	Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.	How much time?	Time.
Twenty-after-ten.	Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.	Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot.
Accident.	You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.	I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...	Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.	I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
Hey.	Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?	Nothing.	Don't look like nothing.	Just banged my head.  It was an accident.	Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
What the hell happened to my car?	Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.	How much!?	Hundred-fifty.	To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?	A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?	About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.	Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?	That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?	"""That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."""	What's that got to do with the radiator hose?	"I don't know, but ""it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.""  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars."	It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.	Then you ain't gonna have the car.	Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had.
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.	I don't have a goddamn credit card.	Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .	You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.	You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...	What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.	I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.	Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.	One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?	You've been there?	Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.	You believe that?	You think bad, and bad is what you get.	That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.	No charge.	Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--	Two-hundred.	What?	It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.	You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.	Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.	I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.	Yeah, but it was shot.	I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.	Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.	What sign?	The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.	What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.	Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.	Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.	Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>.
No! Okay! Okay!	What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
Look, Harlin.	Darrell.	Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?	Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.	And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?	When I work on a car, I work on a car.
What you want?	Open up!	We're closed.  Come back when the sun comes up.
What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?	I want my car.	You got the money?
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.	That's none of your business.  Get the keys.	I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.	Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?	No.	Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
Got any cold soda?	Eh?	Soda.  You got any soda?	Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.	Soda.  You know.
I call the sheriff.	No! No police.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?	I'm just going to my car?	That's right on my way.	My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.	My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?	Do you have to call me that?	I don't know your real name.	Maybe I don't want you to.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.	You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?	I like that about me, beautiful.	It's Grace.	May I carry your package, Grace?
Jesus.	You sure you can manage?	I got it.	Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
No, I've got it.	What happened to your hand?	Accident.	You should be more careful.
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.	No trouble at all, really.
Wasn't nothing.	Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.	That's all right.  I got it.
Thank you, Bobby.	You're welcome, Grace.	You're not from around here, are you?	Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?	You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.	I just drove in this morning.	Drove into Superior?  What for?	Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.	You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?	Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.	And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
Where you coming from?	All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.	You've been around.	I guess I've got wander in my blood.	Where you headed?	I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.	So, what is it you do, Mister...?	Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .	I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.	If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.	What happens when you lose?	I pack up and go somewhere else.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.	I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.	I didn't say it bothered me.	Did you like it; me watching you?	I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.	Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Nice place.	Thank you.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.	I guess it must.	What do you do anyway?	A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes.	Where'd you learn to do that?	From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.	A medicine man?	Those are white words, not ours.	Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.	Come here.
My face tell you all that?	It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?	The same thing you do.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.	What?	Lift me down.
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?	Like you.	Beautiful?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.	Nothing like a little liveliness.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?	I have an idea.	And what would that be?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.	Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.	Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.	I'm just flesh and blood, baby.  That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.
You never did answer my question.	Still playing?	That's not an answer.  What is it you want?	You know what I want.	Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...	How do you know he's still not here?	Guys like me take those chances. Let's go.
Are there snakes out here?	They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.	Doesn't the isolation bother you?	Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.	You love him?	No.	Did you ever?	Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.	Is that why you're with him?	I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?	I'm guessing no.	Yeah, I guess you're right.	I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.	I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.	You could leave him.	I don't know how.	Walk away.	It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.	You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.	Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
What's the matter?...Grace?	Nothing.	Don't feel like nothing.
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.	Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.	You'd never understand.	Try me.	It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...	Nothing I understand better than a mess.
You mean the Shaman?	"He <u>was</u> a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his ""little halfbreed""... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?"
Yeah.	You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...	I'm sorry...	Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?	Yeah.
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.	Is it pretty?	Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.	Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...	Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...	You don't have any money put away, do you?	Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...	...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
Where?	Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.	What do you mean?	At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
In <u>cash</u>?	Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...	One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch.
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.	If the key's on him, how do we get the key?	Kill him.
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.	It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
I wanted to talk.	I don't think we have anything to talk about.	What about us?	There is no us, remember?	Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.	Stop it.	Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?	Because I know you're full of shit.	I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.	I thought you couldn't get your car.	I could if I had Jake's money.	Is that what changed your mind?  The money?	I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?	I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.	You said you couldn't kill anybody.	We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
Grace ... Grace?	After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
The money's right here! Get the key!	No! You get it!
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?	I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.	I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.	Good thinking.  What's all this?	I'm not coming back.
I can't see it.	It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?	You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.	I don't know about that?	You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.	We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.	Can't we just dump him fast someplace?	I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.	Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?	I'm not sailing his boat.	But I thought --	We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.	Anywhere?	What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?	Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.	You already have.
You know I thought you'd left me back there.	What are you talking about?
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.	He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...	The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.	He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...	He was a scumbag!... He wanted <u>me</u>, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're <u>dead</u>...  You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
So, aren't you going to ask me?	Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?	Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?	Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...	Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
Why?	<u>I don't know why</u>!
No Grace, my hand's bothering me.	You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?	You could give me my gun back.
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.	You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?	I believe in this moment, that's all. There is nothing else.  Come on. He must weigh 300 pounds.
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.	Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.	Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?	I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!	You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.	I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?	I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
Time to go for a walk, Jake.	My mother died in this canyon.	Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three...
Hope is a four-letter word.	But we all need that too. Hold him.
Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.	Bobby? Are you all right?	I busted my leg!	Can you make it back up?	Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
Why's that?	'Cause I love you.
And I love you too.	And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
<u>Jake</u>...	He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
Morning, officer.	Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
Where ya goin'?	Harlin's.	Get in.
Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?	No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.	That's a nasty cut you got there.	Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.	There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.	Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.	And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...	"""Arkady"""	Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!	...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.	No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.	The old lady?	With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.	Which you don't have.	But which I can get. No problem. Look, I can sell my car in Vegas. Blue book it's worth 16 at least. I just need the 150, uh...
Yeah, if you could send it care of...	...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.	A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.	A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
What'd you say to me!	Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
I need a ticket.	Where to?	Out of here.	But, in particular?	I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.	Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--	I don't care, just get me there.
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.	How much?	One way, or round trip?	One way.	30.55. Twenty more will get you back.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.	The ticket is 30.55.
Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.	I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...
You got a beer?	What kind?	Beck's.	No Beck's. A-1, Coors...	Heineken?	No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.	Genuine Draft?	No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.	I'll fuckin' take it. To go.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25.  You try to have a nice day now, would you?	Sure, I'll try.
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.	What was that all about?	You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.	More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Let me get your change.	Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Son of a bitch!	Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?	I think I burned my gun hand!
Morning Grace.	Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.	Well it's about time. Looks like you found yourself a helper too.
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.	Oh?
Anybody hurt?	Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son.
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?	No baby, you got it wrong.	This road don't go to Globe, Grace -- where were you going to meet me?
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?	You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!	...But I bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake <u>was really her Papa</u>. And she <u>liked</u> fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you!
Who was that on the phone?	Wrong number.	You spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  But then you make friends so easily.  Don't you, Grace?
I put up new drapes, Jake.	I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?	You never said anything.  About the drapes.	They look nice.	You haven't even looked at them once.
They look nice.	I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
What the hell you looking at, girl?	Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.	Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.	You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!	Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!	You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.	No! No! Please!
What's the matter?	You didn't hear something?	Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.	There's someone in the house.
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.	Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
Help me, Grace, help...	Like you helped her, Jake?
I axed you a question.	Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.	You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.	Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
I want to stay.	I said come on!
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!	You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.	Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?	I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?	What? You trying to bribe me, mister? Just cause you Russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything...
"What's that?  ...""concealed"" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?"	What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.	I want my lawyer!
Yes?	Is Noel in?	No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.	Oh.	I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.	Wow.	I had to put him down.
Proceed.	Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
Is that the entire message?	Yes.
Wrap it up.	You've made a considerably wise decision.
Once again please?	My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.	How old is Jeb?	Four.	No.
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.	What did I say?	Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time...
I'm listening.	I'll keep it in my office room.	What about Jeb?	I have a lock on the door.
I don't think I got the job in New York.	What does that mean?	I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.	I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.	I know.
Is Jeremy okay?	He's asleep.	Oh.
I don't know. It's been a while.	I haven't been sick this year. I know that.	Okay.	Do you remember me getting sick?	Not a specific day. What's this about?	Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
...I can't remember.	That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?	It means we're probably to tired to remember.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?	Yes.	Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.	No that's it.
When was the last time I wore pink?	The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.	Oh shit...	Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
I've come to a decision.	Oh.
Megan?	Yes. Is this David?	Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?	My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
I remember you.	I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?	Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?	You use your sleeve.
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.	He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.
Would you like to try going--	Yes.	out again?
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.	Jesus.
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.	Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
...I think rust.	Rust?	As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.	My turn. What's your favorite song?	Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.	What was that?	We're supposed to be honest.
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.	My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
I'm not sure.	Think carefully?	What about the game?	It's finished. I won.
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--	I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?	That counts.
Why?	I don't know Megan.	It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have.
You've never been sick?	I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?	Seventy-five percent.	Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.	Skeptical about what?	Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
What's he talking about?	In college. A car accident.	Was it serious?
I assumed because of the train.	You assumed wrong.
"You forgot the ""Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on"" step. See usually that comes before the, ""It's over"" Step. And it always, always comes before the ""You can go"" Step.  What is over?"	The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...  And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.  And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality.	What was your idea Elijah?
At the church... You were following me weren't you?	Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you.
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?	You've misunderstood.	I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.'
It's for last week's game.	I've come to understand that...  An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
What do you want?	Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.	We're not proceeding anywhere together.	We've already begun.
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?	Are you for real?	You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting.  Now all I need is your credit card number.
Just give me a minute.	Is there a problem?	That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying.  If he's carrying, he'll step out of line.
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.	How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?	Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.	You thought he was carrying a knife?
I thought he was carrying something.	But not a knife?	I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.  Like on t.v.
You have good instincts when it comes to things like that?	Like what?	Telling when people have done something wrong?
Yes.	Have you ever tried to develop it?	I don't know what you're asking?	You're skill.
Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at--	Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort.
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.	It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.	The guy might not have been carrying anything.	Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
I have to go now.	One last question.
Quick.	The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.	That's not what I witnessed David.	Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.	I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.	You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.
Are you finished?	No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.	It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.	He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.	We are.
He's doing well today.	I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.	He's kind of a miracle.	Yes he is.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.	What's he look like?	He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.	Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.	Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
Yeah?	There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
When?	Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?	I want to sleep here tonight.	I think it's be better if I was alone.	I won't make any noise.	How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?
He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty--	In under six seconds.  I've heard.
I'm going to go in.	Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.	Why'd you do that?	Just one--	Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.	What things?	I'm going to work out.	I'll help you.	There's nothing to do.
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?	No.	What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?	No.	What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.	How much can you lift?
No.	I mean if you knew karate?	No Jeremy.	What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
How much did you take off?	I lied.
How much is it?	Two hundred and seventy.
What do you do if something happens?	Get mom.
How many did you put on that time?	All of it.	There's no more left?
I'm sleeping in my room.	I see.	I'm not scared.	That's great.	Do you know why?
I know now.	Know what?	You're secret identity.  That man was right.
YOU WON'T GET HURT...	Elijah was wrong.
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.	You're lying.	I'm not. I just didn't connect it.
I'll just shoot him once.	Jeremy listen to what--
Don't be scared.	Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
You like sports?	It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.	What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.	Is that right?	But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit.
You represent someone in Philadelphia?	I'm meeting a player from Temple University. He's a cornerback. You like football?
Not really.	This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
Yeah, hello.	Is David Dunne there?
He doesn't look very threatening.	That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind.
How are you feeling?	Okay.
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?	Fine.
Where were you sitting on the train?	Against a window.	In the passenger car?	Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?	Was your family traveling with you?	No.	Did you get up from your seat?	No.
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.	How long have you been married?
Twelve years.	How did you get together?
Now you're going to have to tell me more.	...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.	How so?	Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.	You and my mother would have a special connection.	Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.	...And everyone lived happily ever after.
There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed.  I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true.	And what was that explanation?
Is this a religious thing?	I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.	For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.	I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.	I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.	You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room.
...I got a present for you.	Why?	Forget why. Do you want it or not?
Well, go get it then.	Where is it?	On a bench, across the street.
She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.	No?	All she done was... when she seen he had a teensy little pecker... she gave a giggle. That's all. She didn't know no better.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?	Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.	But what they done, they...
You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?	I fined 'em instead.	For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?	Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...	Like whores?
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?	On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.	Innocent of what?
Where'd you get the money, huh?	We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.	You told them cowboys you had it.	We was... lyin'.	What you gonna do when somebody comes to collect?  FUCK 'EM? FUCK 'EM A THOUSAND TIMES?  The kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. They won't just cut your face up a little.  STUPID CUNTS!
Rain's coming.	Thank God.
I didn't think they'd really do it.	What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?	That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...	What wife? He don't have no wife.	He said...	I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...	I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.	A wise policy. But if you did, I can assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand... in awe.  Whereas, a president... I mean, why not shoot a president?
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.	Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.	Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?	Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.	Ah, I see.
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?	Ha. He was building his fucking porch.	Building his porch!
He's coming ain't he?	'Course he's coming.
What'd he say?	Little Bill? He didn't say nothing. Like I said, he was buildin' his porch. Have you seen that thing?
He didn't say nothin', huh?	Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.	Maybe he ain't so tough.
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.	Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.	Just wondered. Anybody could be scared.
...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?	"Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... an I says, ""Skinny, you can't do that,"" an' he says, ""Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this"" an' I says, ""Bill's sleepin', Skinny,"" an'..."
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...	Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
He tell you where them others is?	Nope.	He give 'em names?	Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.	Well, Ned, you'll want to tell me an' Mister Beauchamp here all about them two villainous friends of yours, I guess.  Bring him in, boys, for I will be glad to know the names and the whereabouts of those other two murdering sonsofbitches.
I thought... you was an angel.	You ain't dead.
Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?	You don't look nothin' like me, mister.	I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?	They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.	Scouting?	On the Bar T... looking for... them.	Oh. How long I been here?	Three days. Are you hungry?	Three days? I must be.
I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.	I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.	That big guy lookin' for me?
Are you really going to kill them?	Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.	Advances?
Free ones?	Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.	Oh. Yeah.	You want... a free one.	Me? No. No, I guess not.
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.	I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...	Your wife?	Yeah. See?	I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.	Yeah, I guess.	She back in Kansas?	Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.	Shit and fried eggs.	Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?	Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.	Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.	I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?	"WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... ""friends."""
Books. He's my biographer.	Oh.
Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?	I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
"Charley, see what kind of ""books"" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet."	Be careful with those, sonny.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.	Enemies, Bob? You been talking about the Queen again? On Independence Day?
Mmmm pistols.	Oh yeah.
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...	Alive?	Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...	He admit it?	No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...	Those cowboys messin' him up?	Uh... a little, maybe.	You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.	No?	This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.	Property.	Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.	You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.	Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.	You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
Hit your finger, huh?	Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?	Heard you done the roof yourself.	Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.	What's all that wood?	Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
Yeah?	Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...	Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.	...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?	Yup.	All week?	I didn't hear nothin' till last night.	Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.	Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's gonna come clear from Texas.	They really got all that money, them whores?	You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe.	That much, huh?	You could run off them two cowboys.	I could run off them whores.	Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.	Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.	Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.	Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.	Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?	I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.	You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.	Like I said, I...	What's your name?	Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?	I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.	Uh... yeah. Yeah.	There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.	Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.	I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.	I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.  Now step aside. boys.
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.	"""Deserve"" don't mean shit, Little Bill."	I'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole.
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?	N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...	Letters?
It's only a b-b-b-book...	A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
The... Duck of Death.	D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?	Uh... Duke.
Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.	Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.	Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...	Meaning the duck himself, I guess.	Duke.	"Duck, I says.  ""You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran,"" said the duck. ""You must apologize."" But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns."""	I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...	Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.	You were there?
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.	But he was called...	"Some folks did call Old Corky ""Two Gun"" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell."
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...	And?	Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.	You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?	Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...	He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.	But... if he doesn't miss?	Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.	Is... is it... loaded?	Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?	Give it to him.
"""Well, Jim,"" I says, ""it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."""	Did you... kill him?	No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character.
I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...	Uh... Sheriff... Uh...	Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.	Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.	What?	Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.	Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
Ned's share?	Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...	He's... he's dead.	No he ain't. He went South yesterday.	They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...	Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
Who killed him?	Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...	He hanged him?  Shot him down?	N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.	Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.	They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.	A sign on him?	"In front of Greely's. It says, ""This here is what happens to..."""	They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?	About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...	What'd Ned say?	L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...	Then... what?	A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...	An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?	Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
"He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said ""Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?"" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73."	Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?	N-no, sir?	Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
William Munny, yeah.	Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't you? And you're the one killed William Harbey an' robbed the train over...	Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.	I could of... easy.	Yeah, I guess so.	Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.	Maybe I ain't.	Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
He said that, huh?	I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.	Schofield? You from Schofield?	On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.	Oh.	Well, how about it?	About what?	Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.	What for?	For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.	Jesus!	Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.	Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...	She's passed on, Kid.	Huh?	Been gone near three years now.	Oh.
Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.	I don't never see nobody anyhow.	If you was to change your mind, might be you could catch me... due West to the Western Trail an' North to Ogallala.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...	Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...	I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
Three ways, I figured.	No.	Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
You're goin' back with him?	He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?	Huh?	Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?	Lookin' at?
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?	Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...	Easy, Kid, easy.  Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?	What business?	An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.	Well... I don't recollect.	You don't recollect!
Get some sleep, Kid.	You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
Finish him, Ned.	He ain't dead? You didn't get him?	He got the boy's horse.
Did you kill him?	He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?	If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.	What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on?
Shit!	What happened, did you hit him?
Better re-load it.	You missed him? You didn't...?	I got him.
He ain't killed.	Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
They takin' water?	Yeah.
When we gonna double back?	After a ways.
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...	Shut up, Kid.
It's gonna get riper yet.	You still think he's in there?	Yeah, he's in there.	Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.	He's in there.	Tell me right off if you see him.	Yup.	You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?	You can shoot him.
Is it him?	Yup.
Did... you... get... him?	Yeah.
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.	I can't see 'em.	Just SHOOT!
Yeah, I guess so.	Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
Say, Bill...	Yeah.
That was... the first one.	First one what?	First one I ever killed.	Yeah?	How I said I shot five men... it wasn't true.  That Mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... I busted his leg with a shovel... I didn't shoot him or nothin'.
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.	H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
Take a drink, Kid.	Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... How he's... DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. Or the other one neither... On account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...	Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.	We all got it comin', Kid.
I trust you, Bill.	Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
Wha... what f-for?	Lemmee see it.	Sure. Sure, Bill.
You... gonna take... the money?	You better get on back, Miss.
You could have it. All of it.	I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.	I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess.
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.	Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?	I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.	You're gonna kill him, ain't you?	Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle.
I... I... think I'm... shot.	You ain't shot.	P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.	You sure you ain't armed?	I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.	A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?	B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.	Yeah.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?	Huh?	Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.	Yeah?
I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.	Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?	I could tell you who was last, mister.
We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.	Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.	How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?	Eleven.	Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...	We done stuff before for money, Ned.	Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?	Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.	Well, I guess they got it comin'...  But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.
How long you gonna be, Bill?	Two weeks, I guess.	This Kid, what's he like?
Three ways?	Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?	Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
He musta been movin' right along.	We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.	Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...	It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.	Sally?	She gave me the evil eye.	It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.	I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.	Well, she...	I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.	You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.	Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.	You ain't like that no more.	Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.	Nor Quincy, I guess.	Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.	You ain't like that no more.	Hell, no. I'm just a fella now. Ain't no different from anyone else no more.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?	Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.	No. I mean...  ...an' get yourself a woman? You know?
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all.	Whaddaya do, just use your hand?	Sometimes... yeah.  I don't miss it all that much.
Some fucker's shootin' at us.	Yeah.	He hit you?	Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?	Beats the hell out of me.	You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?	I didn't see nothin' planted.
HEY.	You're marking us, Bill.	HEY, KID.	Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?	IS THAT YOU, KID?	Why would the Kid shoot at us?	HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY.
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.	Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
Shit.	How far kin you see?
Jesus.	Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.	Yeah... you said that last night.	Last night I said I missed my fuckin' wife... tonight I just miss my fuckin' bed.
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.	Not for me. I don't touch it no more.	God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.	I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
No.	What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...	Yeah?	I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.	Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.	You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?	Huh? Uh... yeah.	I seen him.	He's dead, Bill.	His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.	Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?	Worms was comin' out.	Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.	Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.	Easy, Bill.	I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.	Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?	The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.	Easy, Bill, easy.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...	Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?	She was all covered with worms. Oh, Ned, I'm scared of dyin'...
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?	Two.
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.	We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
You want the Spencer, Bill?	Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.	Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?	I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.	I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.	Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear?
What is it, son?	Two more hogs got the fever.
Who's he?	Best we move that pig.
Hullo, paw.	I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.	Three.	Three? That ain't bad considerin'.
That fella come by... Tom.	Tom?	The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...	The Kid, yeah...	Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time.
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?	Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...	Well, I come back, didn't I?
Did you... did you... ?	Did I what?	All that money... I mean... did you...?	Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.	No... I meant...	What?	K-k-kill somebody?	Who said that?	N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...	Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.	I guess you didn't kill nobody then.	Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?	Thought you was followin' me.
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...	I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.	Nothin's bent.	Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...	You gonna share your half with him?
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.	Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.	Yeah?	I'm a damn good shot.  See that hawk up there? I could kill that hawk with one shot.
Far enough.	We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?	More.	See that scrub oak yonder?	Fuck you.	He's blind, for Chri...	I ain't blind, you asshole.
Say, Ned... ?	Yeah.	How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?	I don't like the question.	Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.	How many you killed, Kid?	Five. I killed five of 'em.  That counts a Mexican I killed.  He come at me with a knife.
Jesus.  You done this before?	Plenty of times.
His pistol must of jammed.	Move the candle closer, I can't see.	He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?	He ain't as tough as you, Kid.	Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...	Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.	That was your idea, I wanted to...
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...	Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.	I don't kill nobody without him.	We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?	All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.	We done that stuff.	Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
He's gonna die, ain't he?	Maybe.	Well, suppose he does?	We'll bury him.	That ain't what I mean.	You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?	I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.	An' if I spot 'em?	I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!	Just like that?	I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.	Yeah?	Hell, yeah.
Jack. What are you doing here?	I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?	Yeah.	You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
There was ninety-one million -	We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.	What was the money for?	He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.	I don't get it.	They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze	Who ?	Bear with me here...
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +	And ?
Keyser Soze	There's more.
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;	He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.	&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;	No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;	He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;	+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;	&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;	&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;	&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;	He says the hair is longer and lighter.
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.	I'm having a stroke.	You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.	Just forget about it.
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.	Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?	They want more time to think about investing.	Goddamnit.	They just said they wanted time.	Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -	No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.	They'll never stop.	I love you.	They ruined me tonight.	Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?
Come home, Dean.	Alright.
That's enough, Edie.	I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.	Edie, please.
I know who he is.	I hope I didn't disturb you.	I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?	A glass of water would be nice.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?	Umm ...	A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative?
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.	Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.	This whole thing was a shakedown.
How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.	So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?	It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.	I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.	I don't want to know.
This is not right.	I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.	Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .	I don't know. This is bad.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.	You are a criminal.	Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.	Then who goes?	We all go. How about it, Keaton?
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.	RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.	They fucking know everything.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.	The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
You heard right.	The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
He's alright.	How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?	His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
Why don't you just calm down'	What do you care what he says?
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.	Dig.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.	Can we stealth these guys?	Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.	Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
Roger really. People say I talk too much.	Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
What are we gonna do?	I can run. I got no problem with that.
Me too.	Did you hear what he just said?	If I'm going in, I want a stake.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...	County. I was in for fraud.	You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?	I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
How do you do?	Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
What the hell do you want?	I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -	I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -	They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
Get out.	If you'll just let me -
Don't hurt me.	Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.	McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
What fence? Who?	Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.	Never heard of him.
You have to come.	What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.	Tough break.	Don't tell me you don't need this. Is this your place?
You watch your mouth.	Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
I was out of line.	You okay?	I'11 be alright.	Well, I'm sorry.	Forget it.  I'11 probably shit blood tonight.
How are they going to do it?	McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.	Fenster and Hockney?	They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.	Three million?	Maybe more.	No killing?	Not if we do it my way.
We'll make it.	Don't do this. Send her a card - something.	We'll make it.
What is it Keaton?	Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
What is this?	Who's Keyser Soze?
What-are they speaking?	Russian, I think. I don't know.	Hungarian?
Keaton, I can't just -	I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.	What if I	Just do what I tell you.
How are you, Keaton?	I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
Ready?	What time is it?
Let's say for example -	This I had to see myself.
with what?	You know damn well, dead-man.	Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been
My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.	Who's your boss?	My employer wishes to remain anonymous.	Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?	I work for Keyser Sate.
You set up the line-up.	Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.	What about Redfoot?	Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
The answer is no.	Mr. Soze will be most -	Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.	A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.	We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.	Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.	Neither do we.
I am sorry, Mr. McManus.  f implore you to believe me, Mr. Keaton. Mr. Soze is very real and very                             + determined.	We'll see.
What did you say?	Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.	You're lying.	Am I? 92 92    INT. HALLWAY - FIFTIETH FLOOR
We're on vacation.	I've got a ton of work and no good people.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.	A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.	I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.	I shivved him.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.	Business or personal?
A little of both.	Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
Get a grip. I didn't know.	You didn't know.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.	Who is he?	Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.	We want to meet him.	He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'	Tell him we'll meet.
What do you mean I can't see him?	The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.	Did they charge him with anything?
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.	What'the fuck is that?
When does he post bail?	Two hours, tops.	I want to see him.
He won't go into the interrogation room.	Someplace else, then.	Where?
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.	Which is shit.	No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.	Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.	I'11 find him.	Waste of time.	A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.	What?	Nothing. Something I - forget it.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired	This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
No, no, no, no, no.	If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?	And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.	You know damn well what I think.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.	I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.	Kobayashi.
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.	Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -	Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.	I told the D.A. everything I know.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.	I know he was good.	He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.	Keaton was a piece of shit.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?	I just want to hear your story.
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.	That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.	Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .	Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.	You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?	You know a religious guy named John Paul?	You know Ruby is in Attica?	He didn't have my lawyer.	I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.	I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?	No.	I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.	I'm not a rat.
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.	You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.	Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.	He loved her.	Sure. And I'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service wasn't his idea
That was all Fenster and McManus.	Come on. Keaton was a cop for four years. Who else would know the Taxi Service
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +	Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +	You got him wrong.	Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
I don't know about that.	I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.	He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.	What lawyer?
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.	The D.A. gave me immunity.	NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.	Is he the one that killed Keaton?	No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.	Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                  53                         + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
So this lawyer...	Kobayashi.	Came from Redfoot.	Right.	And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.?
Do you believe in him, Verbal?	Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.	And this is why you never told the D.A.	You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?	Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?	If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.	Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.	So why play into his hands? We can protect you.	Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.	This is totally irrelevant.	Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.	Can we just get back to Kobayashi?	The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.
You're stalling, Verbal.	Give a guy a break, huh?	What happened?
Then what?	McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.	What call?	Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.	Why didn't you say anything?	I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.	Wait a minute.	I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.	I don't.	YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON .
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .	I don't know what you're talking about.	YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.	Then why didn't you help him?	I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.	But Keaton...	It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.	I never heard of him.	His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.	I said I never heard of him.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.	I don't	There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.	But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?	He wanted me to live.	Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'	Edie.	I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?	Because he was my friend.	No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will.
No...	Keaton was Keyser Soze	NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.	THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
Edie...	He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.	This is all bullshit.	He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.	I knew him. He would never -	He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.	It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ	Why lie about everything else, then?	You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't
You're not safe on your own.	You think he's..?	Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.	I'm not bait. No way. I post today.	You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.	I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.	Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.	Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.	The district attorney's office will comply provided -	No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.	May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.	Immunity.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.	Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.	Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.	You're joking.	Weapons. Misdemeanor one.	Counselor, you're insulting me.	Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
Mr. Abraham...	Abrams...	Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?	I'm fine.	Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?	Yes.	Ah.  How did they treat you?
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?	She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.	What did he find?	Nothing.	How good's your intelligence?	Very good.	And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?	As far as we know, nothing.
He was accused of jury tampering.	Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.	Four cases in three years ...	The man's an ambulance chaser ...	... tell me about this case.	This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.	No -- we don't want this case in court.	Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.	I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.	No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.	So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.	All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?	Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...	I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?	Yes.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...	How did you settle on the amount?	We thought it was just.	You thought it was just.	Yes.	Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.	That was our insurance company's recommendation.	Yes.  It would be.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.	And no one will know the truth.	What is the truth?	That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it.
What are you doing here?	Mickey told me to come back to work.
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...	... yes.  Get her on the phone ...	... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...	Gruber...	Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth.  He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye.  You meet him at the hospital.'
... he wants to testify ...?	It looks that way.	You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?	... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
This is going to drive the ante up.	Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
That's the call that I'm waiting for.	What does it mean?	They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.	Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...	Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.	Yes.	Say it.	I was her doctor.	You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...	...I was one of a group of...	Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?	Yes.	You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?	Yes.
Anything special about the case?	When she...
Thank you.  When Debby...	Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?	Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...	What did these people do when her heart stopped?	We went to Code Blue...	`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?	It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...	Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?	Well, many reasons, actually...	Tell me one?	She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...	She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.	That's right.	And what did your team do...	Well, we...	...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?	Yes.	...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...	...We did everything we could...	...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...	Yes!	You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?	My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...	Tell us.
Ed Concannon.	Frank Galvin.  We've met before.
Objection, we've...	...to get her heartbeat back...?	We've touched on this, his own witness has said...	...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.	Your Honor...!  Your Honor...
Objection!	And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?	That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.	Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?	Just as you are, Sir...	Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?	No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...	...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?	No.	Neurology?	No.	Orthopedics?	I'm just an M.D.	Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?	I know of him.	How is that?	Through, through his book.	What book is that?	Meth...Methodology and Technique...	...of Anesthesiology?	`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.	How old are you?	I am seventy-four years old.	Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?	I'm on the staff of...	Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?	Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.	Do you, indeed.  I'll bet you do. Fine.  Fine.  We'll save the court the time.  We will admit the Doctor as an `expert witness,' fine.
I did.	Objection.
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.	Huh!	My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price.  They wanted this cleared up in court.  They want their vindication.  I agree with them.  But for today the offer stands.  Before we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only.    When I  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
Mr. Concannon...?	Nothing further, your Honor.	Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...	I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
No further questions.	You may step down.
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.	...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...	Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.	I'm going to uphold that.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?	It's a crime.	Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.	I wouldn't do it.	You would not...?	No.	In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?	Yes.	Just now...	Yes.	...sworn before God you would tell the truth?	Yes.	Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?	I . . ..	And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?	I...yes.	Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?	I...	You know these doctors could have settled out of court.  They wanted a trial.  They wanted to clear their names.
They lied.	`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?	I do.  Yes.	You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.	That's not my handwriting.	You've just said you signed it.	Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.	You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?	Because I kept a copy.  I have it right here.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?	I thought I would need it.	And why, please tell us, would you think that?	After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.	... that's all right.	I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...	I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...	... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.	I completely understand ...	We just ...
What is this going to cost?	It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?	Hold on a second.	I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did?  Do you know what you did?
It's all right, Mickey.	You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.	I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...	What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...	I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.	You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.	I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.	Why is that?	Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...	...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...	...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.	Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?	I am seventy-four years old.	What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?	I am on the staff of...	Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...	...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
She getting good care over there?	Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...	Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?	'Code Blue'...	It's a common medical term.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?	Well...
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'	Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?	I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.	The Doctors were not negligent.	I...um...
Dr. Thompson...?	It was good of you to meet...
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...	That's what I'd planned to...	I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...	From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...	Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...	...I made a reservation at...	...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...	...What difference would...	These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...	There's nothing they can do to me.
Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?	Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.	Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?	It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
I didn't do too well for you.	No, you did fine.	I'm afraid that's not true.   Will you want me to stay on till Monday?	No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.	You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.	Yes...I...yes.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.	No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?	Yes.  I wrote it.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?	I.  Yes.  It is.	And you wrote that...	Yes.	...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?	She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.	If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?	Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.	Thank you.
Dr. Gruber ...	Yes?  Galvin, right?
I appreciate--a man as busy as--	That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
I read the hospital report on your client.	... Deborah Ann Kaye ...	... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...	Right.  Who called?	The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...	... and you're going to do that?	Yes.	You're going to settle out of court?
Yes.	Why?
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...	Her doctors killed her.	) I'm sorry ...?	Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.	Do you know who her doctors were?	I read the file.  Yeah.  Marx and Towler.  I know who they were.	The most respected ...	Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...	What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..	Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...	I understand.	... the case with anyone.  And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony ...
Thank you ...	... that's perfectly all right.	Uh, why, why are you doing this?	To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.	I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...	I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?	No.	He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?	...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?	I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...	I've got nothing to say to you.	You know what happened.	Nothing happened.	Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand.	And ask me what?	Who put my client in the hospital for life.	I didn't do it, Mister.	Who are you protecting, then?	Who says that I'm protecting anyone?	I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?	I don't owe them a goddamn thing.	Then why don't you testify?	You know, you're pushy, fella...	You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...	Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
Yessir.  I'm sorry.	Why is that?	I was held up.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.	This is a complicated case, your Honor...	I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?	My client can't walk, your Honor.	I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket.  You follow me?  I'm trying to help you.
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.	...things change.	...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...	I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...	And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.	I'm sure you would.
What is it?	Thank you for seeing me.	That's perfectly all right.
I need an extension for my case.	You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.	I had a witness disappear on me.	That happens.	I could subpoena him if I had a week.	I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Is the Plaintiff ready?	Ready, your Honor.	Defense...?
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.	Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.	What?	I believe that's the law...is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
Yes, Mr. Galvin?	If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...	I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.	I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.	Listen to me, fella...	No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
Galvin, look, many years ago...	And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.	Are you done?	Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.	You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy.  We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end.  Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
Nothing further, your Honor...	Mr. Concannon...?
I object, your Honor...	Overruled...	Exception!	Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
Continental Casualty...	Mr. Alito, please.	Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...	I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?	I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...	...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...	I can't guarantee that...	I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.
Mr. Galvin's...	Let me talk to Mickey.
Hello, I'm calling from...	If you're selling something, I'm late for work...	I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...	From the magazine?	This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?	How come you're calling me from...?	This is Miss Costello...?	Yes.  Price...	Pardon?	Kathy Price.	We find that your subscription lapsed...	My subscription lapsed three years ago...	That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...	Missus...	We have a renew-your-subscription offer...	We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.	Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...	No.  At Chelsea Childcare.  Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey?  I'm late for work.
D'you find an apartment?	Still looking.	I changed my life today.  What did you do?	I changed my room at the Hotel.	Why?	The TV didn't work.	What Hotel are you staying at?	And what are you?  A cop?	I'm a lawyer.	My ex-husband was a lawyer.	Really.  How wonderful for you.	Yes.  It was, actually.	Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?	Who says I'm the one that called it off?	A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?	Laura.	My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.	What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?	You just got lucky.   D'you eat yet?  Come on.
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?	I think I will.
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.	And are they going to get it?	They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'	Maybe what?	Maybe I can do something right.	And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?	That's what I'm going to try to do.
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?	What...?	Is this a bad time.	We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...	What happened...?	They, uh, they got to my witness.	...and is that serious?
I've got to work...	Do you want me to go...?	No, no, I'm just...
Why don't you get some rest?	I've got to work.	You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...	You're going to stay here...?	Yes.
Do you think it's my fault?	Isn't there something you...	That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.	You're talking like a drunk.	That's what I am.
And it's over...?	Yes.	Well, then what are you doing here?	I...do you want me to leave?	You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?	I...	You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.	Who told you that?	You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.	And what makes you so tough?	Maybe I'll tell you later.	Is there going to be a later...?	Not if you don't grow up...	If I don't 'grow up...'	You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...	You, you don't under...	Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!	It's over!	What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...	What is that to you...?	What would you like it to be to me...?  I, I, I can't invest in failure.
Joe...  Joe...	Stop pressuring me...
You're pressuring yourself...	No...no...	Yes.   We've all got to let go.
Is it over?	No.	What are you going to do?	I don't have a goddamned idea.
Thank you.	I have to talk to you.	Call the A.M.A.  to Laura) ...I can't talk now.  ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody...you have to find this nurse...
Dr. Gruber.	Dr. Gruber's not in.	I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...	He's not in, Sir.	Where is he?
I...please.  My wife...my wife's prescription has run out.  If I can call him...	Dr. Halpern's taking all his...	No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..	He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
Hi, Mickey ...	What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?	Uh ...	Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...	... now who is that ...?	... You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them ...	Sally Doneghy, now who is that?	One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...	... hey, I don't need your charity ...	... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.
I have to talk to you.	What do you want?	Come on.  Let's get a drink.	Don't touch anything.
Are you out of your mind...?	...I'm going to need your help...	You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?	I'm going to help her.	To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...	They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...	That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it.  We let them buy the case.  That's what I took it for.  You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...	What?	You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'	I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.	...he's a good man...	...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.	...I have to stand up for her...	Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.	I have to try this case.  I have to do it, Mick.  I've got to stand up for that girl.  I need your help.    Mick, will you help me...?    Will you help me...?
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.	You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.	Admittance form is wrong.	Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.	I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...	...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'	They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?	No.	'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.	Right.	Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.	Right.	Brindisi versus Electric Boat.	You got a good memory, Franky.	I had a good teacher.  McLean versus Urban Transport...
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.	Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?	I'm going to get laid.
Been a long time, huh...?	I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?	Mary Rooney.  She won't talk to me.  I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
So what?	So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'	They still have to take it to a jury.
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.	So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.	Oh shit, what's today?	Today is Tuesday.  What?	I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?	Give 'em a box of Macanudos.	Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
What happened, Joey...?	I can't talk now.	D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
Yeah?  How's our new witness?	D'you find the obstetric nurse?	She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...	Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
How are you holding up?	I'm swell.	And all we've got is a witch doctor!	Yeah.
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?	You use their witness.	That's right.	I think we tried that.  The case is over.
Are you with me...are you awake...?	Yeah.  I'm awake.	Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?	The Doctors.	She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...	Read me what she said.
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'	...one of the other nurses?	Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.	All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?	What difference can that make...? All right...
Uh...the admitting nurse...	What did she do?	She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'	The 'History'...?	How old are you, how many children ... when did you last eat ...
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?	The broad has disappeared...	The Hospital...?
...yeah...good...	...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
...four years ago...	Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...	I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette...
What the hell are you doing here?	We got to talk.
What are you doing in New York...?	Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?	I don't know.
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?	I don't want a mistrial.
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?	It's locked.	It's locked?
It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...	... we, we love her, Dick and me ...	... I'm sure you do ...	But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...	... I know.  I went ...	... You saw her?	Yes.  Yes, I have.	You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.	... fifty thousand dollars?	I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...	... I understand ...	My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...	... I understand ...	... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
He saw her at the Northern Care...	... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.	I'm going to see you get that chance.
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...	We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...	Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...	Yes.
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.	I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...	She told me.	She did?	I just saw her.	In New York?	What?	You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
Hi.	Hi.  How are you doing?
I've been meaning to come in a long time.	You live in the neighborhood?	Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.	How old is he?	Four.  You're great with these kids.
Thank you.	You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?	Who told you that?	Mrs...	Mrs. Simmonds.	Yes.	I used to be a nurse.	That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?
Kathy Price...	Yes...	You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...	Yes.
Yes.	These are your initials, 'K.C.'?	Kathy Costello.  That's my maiden name.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?	Yes.	What did she say?	She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.	One hour.	Yes.	And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?	I did.	A single hour.	Yes.
Another, Frank . . . ?	...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.
I want to buy you a drink.	Thanks, Franky.
Well, well, well.  Huh?	Yeah.	It's a long road that has no turning.	That's for sure, Frank.
Dr. Towler...	Yes.	You have a record of what happened in the operating room...	Yes, that's correct.	...there are notations every thirty seconds...	Yes.	...of the procedures...	Yes, the roving nurse...	But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...	We, we were rather busy...	Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...	As I've said we had some more...	...they start again three minutes earlier...	We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...	What happened in those three...	...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.	What happened in those three minutes...?	We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...	Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...	Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?	Yes.	Huh.  And why is that?	Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.	How'm I doing so far?	So far you're great.  You got a cigarette?
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?	Should I?	A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?	Yes.	...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.	The Big Boy did...?	That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.	Huh.	Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?	Me, too.	Okay.  Now, so he's in jail.  He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake.  As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.   P.S.  He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink  and mopes around three and a half years.   You like that story?
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?	It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.	He won't talk.	No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.	I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.	Ah? That complicates the problem.	I'll give you another complication: he still is.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?	I married into it.
Interesting business.	No, to be honest, I find it dull.	You don't have to do it for a living.	No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.	How long have you been back?	Almost a year.	And you like it.	San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
Like all this.	I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?	No, I'm all right.	I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?	No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
Would you like a drink now?	"No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the ""old college gang""; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?"
Not what you think. We're very happily married.	Then?	I'm afraid some harm may come to her.	From whom?	Someone dead.
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?	No.	If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?	I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.	Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
I didn't mean to be that rough.	No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?	No.	I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...	How often does this happen?	More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.	Where'd she go?
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.	Well?	The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.	Have you talked to the doctors at all?	Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --	I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --	I want you.	It's not my line.	Scottie, I need a friend!  Someone I can trust! I'm in a panic about this!
How can I see her, to know her?	We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?	Ernie's.	All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.	That's Carlotta Valdes.	Yes.	There are things you didn't tell me.	I didn't know where she was going to lead you.	But you knew about this.	Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.	Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?	Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.	Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.	But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.	Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?	Nothing.	And when she goes to those places...	She is not my wife.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?	Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.	Why did she never tell her daughter?	Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.	I -- I --	No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
Hello.	Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.	No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.	What happened?	She... went into the Bay.
Hello?	Did she hurt herself?	No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
Could I ask you a couple of questions?	What for? Who are you?	My name is John Ferguson, and --	Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?	No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --	Do you live here in the hotel?	No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --	0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!	Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!	I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
Just let me talk to you.	What about?	You.	Why?
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!	You're not far wrong.	Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.	Let me come in.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.	You won't have to.	Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
What do you want to know?	Your name. And --	Judy Barton.	Who you are --	Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --	-- and how you happen to be living here.	It's a place to live, that's all.	But you haven't lived here long.	About three years.	No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?	I told you! Right here!	But before! Where did you live before!?!	Salina, Kansas!
Listen, what is this? What do you want?	I want to know who you are.	I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
Will you have dinner with me?	Why?	Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...	No, you don't owe me anything.	Then will you for me?	Dinner... and what else?	Just dinner.	Because I remind you of her?	Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.	I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.	Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!	An hour?	Mmm.	Okay.
Thank you again. Good-night.	Can I see you tomorrow?	Tomorrow night? Well --	Tomorrow morning.	Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.	Don't go.	And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?	I'll take care of you.	Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.	No, Judy, you don't understand.	Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.	No.	No? Then what?	I just want to see you as much as I can!	"As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd ""take care of me""?"	Yes.	Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...	No.	That's not very complimentary, either.
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!	Why?!	Please! And don't look at me.
Will you, Judy?	I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
I like that one.	No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?	Yes --
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.	Honest?
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.	But Scottie, you don't have to!	I want to! Come on!
But I like that one, Scottie.	No, it's not right.
Scottie, what are you doing?	I'm trying to buy you a suit.	But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.	They're none of them right.	But why?
You want me to dress like her?	Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.	Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!	Judy --	It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --	No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!	Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!
I don't like it!	We'll take it! Will it fit?
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.	You can.	No, you wouldn't let me.  And I don't want to go...
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.	I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.	No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.
You don't even want to touch me.	Yes. Yes, I do.
The color of your hair...	Ah, no!	Judy, please it can't matter to you...
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?	Yes.	All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
Well?	It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.	We tried it. It didn't suit me.
Where shall we go for dinner?	Wherever you'd like...	Ernie's?	You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?	"Well, after all, it's ""our place."""
Mmmm.	Is that the best you can do?
Come here.	Oh, no. You'll muss me.	That's what I had in mind.	Too late. I've got my face on.
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?	No, Ernie's is fine.	I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start...
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.	Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!	All in good time.
Scottie!	How does it work?	Can't you see?	Oh, yeah. There.
We're going awfully far.	I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?	No, it's all right.
Where are you going?	To complete my cure.
Scottie, why are we here?	I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.	But why? Why here?	Madeleine died here.
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.	I need you.	Why?	I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
I'm scared.	So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
"...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, ""If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --"	Scottie --	"-- and wanted to go on loving you."" And I said, ""I won't lose you.""  But I did."
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.	Take me away...	You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.	No!	Go up the stairs, Judy.  I'll follow.
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.	No! Let me go!	We're going up the tower.	You can't. You're afraid!	I'm going to. It's my second chance.
Scottie, please...!	But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?	Yes!	And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?	Dead. He'd broken her neck.	Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?	I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --	Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?	Yes!	And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!	Your accident...	Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?	I don't know... Switzerland?	We'll find him.
I made it.	What are you going to do?	Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?	Some money.	And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
What are you going to do?	I loved you, Madeleine.	I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
Love me... keep me safe...	Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
Why am I here? What happened?	You...  ...fell into the Bay.
You don't remember.	No...	Do you remember where you were?	Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!	Where were you?	At...
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!	Why?	Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.	Where had you been before?	When?	This afternoon.	Oh... wandering about.	Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
Please drink your coffee.	I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.	I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.	You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?	Wandering about.	You like it, too.
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.	Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.	No.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...	Oh! Yes! Here!
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.	I... didn't know where you lived.	You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?	Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.	No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.	My name is John Ferguson.	That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.	John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.	I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.	No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.	I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?	Wander about.	That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
One shouldn't live alone.	Some people prefer it.	No... it's wrong.
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?	What?	...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?	No... this is the first time for me, too.
Oh! Yes. Hello.	Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.	I... suddenly felt such a fool.	I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?	Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.	You've nothing to apologize for.	Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!	Not at all, I enjoyed --
-- talking to you...	I enjoyed talking to you.
Would you like some coffee?	No! No, thank you!
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.	The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
I hope we will, too.	What?	Meet again, sometime.	We have.
Good-bye.	Good-bye.
I don't know.	Shopping?	No.	Well... anywhere in particular?	No, I Just thought I'd wander.	Ah.  That's what I was going to do.	Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...	Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.	No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
Do you know where you're going?	Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!	How can you be sure?	If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
How old?	Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.	The oldest living things?
What are you thinking?	Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.	Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.	I don't like them.	Why?	Knowing I have to die...
Do you hear anything?	Only silence. It's always like this.	And no birds sing.	No birds live here.	No.
Would you like a drink of water?	No, thank you.
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...	Madeleine!
Where are you now?	Here with you.	Where?	The tall trees...	Have you been here before?	Yes...	When?
Where were you born?	Long ago...	Where?
No!... No!	Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?	No, don't ask me!
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.	I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!	Why did you jump?	No!	What was it inside that told you to jump?
No, I can't tell you!	What?!	No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
Take me away from here?	Home?	...somewhere in the light.
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.	And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.	Yesterday.
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.	Vaguely...	What do you remember?	A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...	Would you know the room?	No... it's in shadow.	What else?	A grave...	Where?	I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.	How do you know?	I know.	There's a name on the gravestone.	No. It's new and clean, and waiting.	What else?	This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.	A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?	No.	Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?	But I'm the woman in the mirror!	No!
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...	And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!	I'm here, I've got you...	I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
Don't leave me... stay with me...	All the time.
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...	Why? What's happened?	I had the dream. The dream came back again...
No, don't go away!	Only this far.
Where's your husband?	I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?	It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...	Yes --	But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...	Tell me.	There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
Go on.	At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --	-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.	Yes?! But --	It's all there. It's no dream.
You've been there before. You've seen it.	No, never!	Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!	No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?	I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
Here with you.	And it's a all real.	Yes.	Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  Madeleine, think of when you were here!
My love... because I love you.	I love you too... too late... too late...	No... we're together...	Too late... there's something I must do...
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.	You can't.	Why?	Let me go.	Where?	To the church, I must go there.	Madeleine --	Please let me go.
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!	It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --	Let me go! Let me go!!	Madeleine!!
You believe that I love you?	Yes.	And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.	I won't lose you.
Let me go into the church alone.	Why?	Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
Is there something I can do for you?	Yes... you run this hotel.	Oh, yes!	Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?	Oh, I'm afraid we couldn't give out information of that sort. Our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. And I do believe it's against the law! Of course, I don't think any of them would mind, really, but still I would have to know who you are, and ask --
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?	Please answer my question.	I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --	What is her name?	Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.	Carlotta Valdes?	Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.	How long has she had the room?	Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.	Does she sleep here? Ever?	No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --	When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.	I saw her come in five minutes. ago.	Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
And there! There you see? Her key is on the rack!	Would you please go and look?	In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
Her car is gone.	What car?
Ow!!	I thought you said no more aches and pains?	It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.	No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.	Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!	What's tomorrow?	Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?	More than you think.	How do you know? Personal experience?	Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?	What do you mean?	What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?	You sound so disapproving, Midge.	No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.	I had to quit, Midge.	Why?	I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.	It wasn't your fault.	I know. Everybody tells me.	Johnny, the doctors explained --	I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.	Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?	And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?	It's where you belong.	Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!	Ah, Johnny-O...
Well?... what'll you do?	Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.	Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?	To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.	Have you had any dizzy spells this week?	I'm having one now.
From that music.	Oh!
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.	I've never run across one like that.	It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.	Uh-huh!	An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.	What a pleasant hobby.
How's your love life, Midge?	That's following a train of thought.	Well?	Normal.	Aren't you ever going to get married?	You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.	Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?	Three whole weeks.	Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?	Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.	I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.	That's Skid Row... isn't it?	Could be.	He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.	Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight.	Sorry, old man. Work.	Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?	What.	My... the acrophobia.	I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.	I think I can lick it.	How?	I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.	That!?!	What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.	Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Step number two.	Okay.
Easy, now.	This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
Johnny!	Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
"Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this ""hello you look wonderful"" stuff. Just a good straight ""who do you know"" --"	Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.	Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.	Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!	Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?	Yeah.	Pop Leibel.	Who?	Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?	Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?	Do you know him well?	Pop Leibel? Sure.	All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
The poor thing....	And she died...
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.	For what?	For bringing you here. Come on, tell!	Nothing to tell.	You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!	I'll take you home.
Here you are.	You haven't told me everything.	I've told you enough.	Who's the guy, who's the wife?	Out. I've got things to do.	I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.	Out!	And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!	I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!	Think?  Well, what do you think?
Is she pretty?	Carlotta?	No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.	Mmm, yeah, I guess...
Midge!	Bye-bye!
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?	Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?	Just wander.	Where?	Around.	Oh?
Mm. Better.	Did you need it?	Yeah.	Oh?
What was this desperate urge to see me?	"All I said in the note was: ""Where are you?"" That doesn't sound desperate to me."	Well, I detected an undercurrent.	I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.	Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?	Oh... this and that.	What I've been doing?	If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.	Naturally.
What have you been doing?	Wandering.
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.	Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.	Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.	What is it, a still life?	No, not exactly. Want to see?
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.	Oh?
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...	What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?	It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.	By whom?	By... no... the name I do not remember. A rich man, a powerful man.  It is not an unusual story. She came from somewhere small, to the south of the city... some say from a mission settlement... young, yes; very young.  And she was found singing and dancing in a cabaret by the man... wait... wait... Ives! His name was Ives!  Yes. And he took her and built for her this great house in the Western Addition... and there was a child. Yes. This was it. The child.
She died.	How?	By her own hand.  There are many such stories.	Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.	But you said grey, sir.	Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted.
She'll be out in a moment.	Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
Yes! That's it!	I thought so!
Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.	How soon can it be altered?	Well...	Can we have it by tonight?	Well, if it's absolutely necessary...	Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out.
The stripper's here.	Excellent.
She's fucking hot!	I need a drink.
Jesus.	Don't touch her. Call 911.
They'll get us on accesory to murder.	Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.	"That's a horrible ugly comment. ""Dead whore?"" She's a person!"
Can't do what?	We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
How ya doing?	What?	What's that?	What did you say?	I said how's it going?	I didn't hear you.	Well that's what I said.
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.	First of all...	No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.	You're interrupting a personal conversation.	Sorry Fish.
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.	Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?	No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.	Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
You're an asshole Adam.	You're an asshole.	Oh, and why am I an asshole?	Multiple reasons.	Name one.	I don't have to...
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...	Franco mother-fucking Harris!
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.	She's dead.
We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head.	Playing?
The floor was wet. She slipped!	Why was the floor wet?	I don't know why the floor was wet!	Why?!
Why?	It's sacrilegious.
This is pathetic.	You're pathetic.	What did you say?	You're not a team player.	Don't point at me.	You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.	I have plenty of friends.	The hell you do.	The hell I don't.	You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.	What are you fucking talking about?
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.	They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd.
About anybody but yourself. You never have.	And you're a little fucking reject.	Eat my ass!
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.	You're a loser.
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.	You fucking bastard!
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.	Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.	Go home!	You go home!
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.	I'm not getting a ticket.
Don't even start.	You want to hear me out?
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.	You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.	I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I?  Prison Communications.
More.	Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
She's got no fucking pulse.	You don't know what you're doing.
Wait!	What?	What are you doing?	What are you talking about?	What do you think you are doing?	I'm calling the ambulance.	Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?	Calling the ambulance.	Why?  Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance?
We have to call the ambulance.	Why?
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!	Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?	Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
Are you sure this was an accident?	You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.	We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.	Call the police. Okay, that's one option.	"That is not an ""option."" There is no multiple choice here."	Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
Stop it!	There's more.	Just stop.	Just giving the facts.	I'm calling the police.	What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
Bury her out in the desert.	Sure, why not.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.	We can do this. We can get her out of here.	Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?	Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.	It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
Her fucking head was caved in.	So I didn't fucking do it!	She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.	You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?	We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.	What about the blood?	Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.	Have you ever done this before?	The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this.
Sun rises at 5:52.	I'm not wrecking the transmission!
Wait. Wait a minute.	What?	We can't do this.	We've already done this.	No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
How do you figure?	According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.	So that's what we're doing.	No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.	She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.	That is absolutely not true.	Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?	Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
We have to get going.	I am not flexible on this.	Alright. Let's do it.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.	We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first.	Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!	What does that mean?	You got us into this mess.	Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.	Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!	Lighten up Adam. Show some character.	Don't talk to me about character.	Watch the tone fella.
Fuck you Boyd!	Any time fat boy!
What is your problem?	I can't do this.
What?	At the seven-eleven.	Who? What are you talking about?	They're on me. They're smoking me out!	Nobody's smoking anybody out.
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.	I don't give a damn.
I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in!	Adam! Calm down.	I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.	It has worked.	I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.	They won't figure it out.	I got children. I've got a life.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?	No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all.
Don't snap at them!	They're driving me nuts!	They're singing.
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.	What?	They're screaming for Starbursts.	Later.	They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
Where's the candy?	There is no candy!	What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!
We'll be ready Adam.	I know you'll be.  Three hours.
That's one idea.	No...we want padded chairs...okay?
Real times.	They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.	Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.	Are you solid with that?	No. I think it's fucked.	Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here?
The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.	Don't ever stare him down.	I won't do it.	Don't eyeball your kids.
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...	I know and I'm honored...	If anything ever happens to me...	I know...	Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.	What happened? Oh my God...
No way.	It has to be done.
I want you to hear me out.	What.	You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.	I don't think so.	We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
Have you thought about what I said?	Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?	I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...	I got you.	Where's the bathroom?
My god.	There's more.
Money?	Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.	What does that mean?
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.	Well, oh...	And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.	So where's that leave us?
So. When is the wedding.	Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
What are you talking about?	Don't sweet lip me.	I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...	You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.	Nothing happened in Vegas.	I don't want to hear it from the liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? What happened in Vegas?
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?	Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...	Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.	I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.	Lois please.
What is it?	Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
What?	I'm with Tina. Is she there?
She's not here.	Where is she?	She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
Okay. Hi.	So who's the lucky guy?	Who?	The groom?
Yup.	Doing the bachelor party thing?	That's right.	Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?	She's in the bathroom...she's still working.	She's still working?	That's right.	Sweet deal.
Is everything okay?	Great. Fine. Perfect.
She's in there!	I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
No I don't.	Fish?
Your investment ideas never work out.	That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
I don't think so Boyd.	Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir.
But not tonight.	Not tonight.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...	Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard...
Where do you look? What side of the neck?	Left side.
He's right.	We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
I got her arm.	Here's his head.
The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.	Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
What's your fucking point?	I'm not talking to you?
What's goosed?	What is her disposition?
He just had two.	Give me two more.
He's too drunk.	He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
You said that Boyd.	Well, I didn't mean it.
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.	Who's up for making some real money?
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...	Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.	That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.	We need padded chairs.	Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.	I can't.
Oh, Jesus...call the police.	No.	She's dead. Call somebody!	Shut up.	Call 911.	Shut up.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!	Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.	Nobody knows.
Oh God. This is insane.	What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
Nobody knows she's here.	Good God...Good God...
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.	I'm calling the police.	So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.	I think we should say some words over the grave.	What kind of words?	I'm talking about prayer.	Go ahead.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.	No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
"It goes; ""Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."""	However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.	You always were a jealous man.
The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left...	No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking...
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.	Shut up Boyd.	Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.	He's having a problem here.
Easy Boyd.	No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
He's cracked up.	He is not cracking up.	Boyd...What have we done?	What did you ask me?	What?	What is the question you asked me?	I said, what have we done?	Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?	I don't know! I just want to get married.	Say it again.	What?	What you just said. Say it again.	I just want to get married.	Exactly! Exactly my point.
What's your point?	You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
Regarding what?	Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?	No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.	Suck my ass.
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.	I don't think that's such a good idea.	Just do it.	What are you going to do?	Take care of business.	What does that mean?	And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?	I don't know...	You got a nasty side to your thought process.
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.	What does that mean?
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?	Yeah.	Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.	Hear what?	That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.	Now?
That's right.	Isn't it a little late?	Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.	I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.	My what?	You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.	You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?	I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!	Okay fine.	Fine? Fine what?	Whatever you say Kojak.	I'm serious.	I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.	You're sick.	And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!	Not a prayer.	I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!	You need help.
You're a fucking moron.	It's my fucking opinion.
The hell I did!	The hell you didn't!	The hell I did!	You said one in two marriages end in divorce.	I never heard that.
Nope.	Moore?
Your ideas never work out.	Oh really? Starbucks?
I don't hate women.	You hate women.	False.	True.	Not true.	You have a King fantasy.	I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.	And what happens when you can't?	New king.
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?	Israel doesn't have a King.	Then what do they have?	They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.	I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.	What's your point?	Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?	The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.	There's my point exactly.	What? What's your point?	Take Mexico.	What?	Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico.
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.	They need leadership.	That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?	Not really, no.	Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.	You said nobody would miss her.	No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!	You will not screw this up.
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?	Ball park sausages.	You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?	"Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for ""The Immaculate Reception,"" his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime."	Easy Micheal.	He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
We're goosed.	We're not goosed.
We're goosed! Goosed by God!	Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
Stop it!	Goosed!
Stop.	Goosed!	Give me the Valium.
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.	How about my Fatburger?	Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?	I love you.
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.	All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?	Are we supposed to?	It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
May we have the rings please?	What?	The rings?
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?	I do.
This is ridiculous.	Government cutbacks.	Why can't we do it through the mail?	We missed the deadline.	Can't we do it on the phone?	I don't think so.
Why is this Kid staring at me?	I'm not sure.
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?	I think so.	What do you mean, you think so?	I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.	The wedding cake check?	Sent it.	Photographer?	Sent it.	Florist?	Yup.	Caterer?	Yes.	Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...	I think I forgot the tent.	You forgot the tent?	I think so.	Why?	Why what?	Why did you forget the tent check?	I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.	You can't play around with these tent people.	I'm not playing around. I forgot.	What else have you forgot?	How could I know what else I forgot?	I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.	Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.	Don't you dare.	What?	Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
Stop it. I'm sorry.	You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.	I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.	I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.	Are we going to do this again?	I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.	I wouldn't know.	It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.	They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.	Well it's bad timing.	How do you figure?	Right before the wedding?	It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.	I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.	He is.	He's a moron.	He's my friend. He's not a moron.	David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?	What are you talking about?	I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.	I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.	I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...	Who else?	Charles Moore for instants.	You don't like Moore? Since when?	It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.	What does Moore have to do with your growing?	I just don't see him in the big picture.	I've known him since Cub Scouts.	He's weird.	He's quiet.	He's weird.
He just doesn't talk a lot.	Why? What's his problem?	He's a great chef.	He's weird. And I expect more from you.	You expect more what?	"You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on ""Oprah"" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them."	Time out.	It's vile!
That's absurd.	I've seen it on television.	I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.	I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!	You will not be common!!!
Do you love me?	Of course.	How much?	With all my heart.	Kiss me...?
We've got problems here.	Problems?
Seating problems.	Okay.	Keith do not trivialize this.	I'm not. What's the problem?	We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.	What kind of seats can we have?	Not padded ones.	So what do we do?	You go down there.	Go down where?	Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.	Honey I don't have the time...	I need your help.	We're leaving in three hours.	I need your help.	I'll call them from the road.	Do you love me?	More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.	Take care of those chairs.	We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.	Maybe.
Will you please call the chair people?	I will.	Do you love me?	Of course.	Just call and let me know that your okay.	I love you.	Have a nice bachelor party.
Hello.	Hi.
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?	Not yet.	Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?	I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.	That's sweet.	Well I do.	Well you should.	What are you doing?	Just a bit of organizing.	Nesting?	Yeah. Nesting.	I'm mad at you.	Go have fun. Not too much.	I'll see you tomorrow...
Hello.	Hey. It's me.	Where are you?	We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.	How late?	No. Just like an hour or so.	What about the chairs?	Okay.	What okay?	What!	The chairs.	I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.	You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?	No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
What's the word on the chairs?	I'm working on it.	Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge.
"""Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me."	"""At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."""
This is our honeymoon.	After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house...
Yeah baby. Everything's great.	Well, can you come back inside?	Yeah. Sure.	Now?	Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.	Are they fighting?	No baby. We'll all be right in.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!	Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.	No way.	Can we just talk this out?	Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.	We're not canceling.	I know.	I won't even discuss it.	No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.	I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.	Don't we already have someone to do that for us?	Yeah. You.	Okay. Okay.
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.	No.	Yes.
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.	No it's not okay. It's not.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.	Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.	Don't even.	Do you love me?	What?	Do you love me?	What kind of stupid question is that?	Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...	What are you talking about?	Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.	Who's dead?	The prostitute.	You fucked a prostitute?	No Micheal did. It was an accident.	You killed a prostitute.	Micheal, by accident.	Call the police.	It's too late.	My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?	She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.	You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?	She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...	Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.	But...	No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.	But...	No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water!
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!	What money?
He kept saying he was protected.	What does that mean?	Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.	Like how?	I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.	The only proof is those bodies.	So what do we do?	Move the bodies.	Move the bodies?
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...	You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.	What?	If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.	No...	You put him down or don't bother coming back.	But...	Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...	You did all right dad.	I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.	You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.	"I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, ""My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me."" Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me."	"Harry Chaplin. ""Cats in the Cradle."""	Just kills me...	I love you dad.	I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey.  And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out.  You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead!
Everything okay?	Yeah, Dad. It's great.	Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.	OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
That's just insecurity.	I don't know. She's really been stressing out.	Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.	What does that mean?	It means she's insecure.	About what?
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.	I just want her to be happy.	Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes...  Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.
I'm not breathing right.	You're not breathing right?	Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes.
I don't care for him.	He's your brother.	So?
I'll take a ride.	Go for it.	Come on.
I'm getting married...	I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.	Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
Where did you get that?	At the newsstand on 3rd.
Do you hear buzzing Fish?	Buzzing?	Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.	I don't hear it.	Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.	Have another drink.
"Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... ""Get ready""...""watch for it""...""here it comes,"" here comes the ""wahoo""."	The wahoo?	The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?	The wahoo moment?	That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?	I think so.	I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.	No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...	What is it?	Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.
That ought to be about the end of that.	Yup.
No...No.	How do you know she's dead.
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.	I got to agree with that.
The first day.	What?
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.	Did she believe you?	I have no idea.	You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.	Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.	A move?	Greenpeace.	Greenpeace?	Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim...
Where's Boyd?	Downstairs in the closet.
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.	My God...	"He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading ""Atlas Shrugged,"" staring at himself in the mirror."	Did he try to kiss you?	All week long.
You alright?	"Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping ""Immaculate Reception?"" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?"	I guess.	"I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - ""Pup Corn."""	Pup corn?	"That's right, ""Pup Corn."" Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of ""Pup Corn"" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes ""Shelmer,"" our 8 year old mutt. ""Here Shelmer,"" my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, ""Here girl."" This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the ""Pup Corn."" Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, ""Pup Corn"" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never."
There.	Where?
Yeah?	I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.	That's a good one.	I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.	That's what I'm thinking.
Well that ought to be about the end of that.	Yup.
"We don't say ""love, honor and obey"" anymore. And we don't say ""till death do us part."" Today we say, ""respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love."" How does that sound?"	"I kind of like ""till death do us part."" I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?"
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.	Okay great. What will that be?	We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.	What song?	"""You Send Me."""	Oh I know that. How does it go...	You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
Liz do you take Fisher to be your beloved husband, to respect, honor and cherish him till death do you part?	I do.
...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...	...embarrassing, shameful...	...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...	The stone age.	The post-Vegas Man.	A mutant species.	Okay boys, smile!
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.	Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.	We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.	Take your time. I wish I had.	We will.	So where to on the honeymoon?
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.	That's our plan.	Well, I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling.
Good times.	Drum banging real times.
She's dead.	It was an accident!
Fucking desert.	Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
Right.	That's right.
Shut up Micheal.	I KILLED MY BROTHER!
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.	I don't think that's a good idea.	I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here?
I'll come to you tonight.	No, the children sleep with me.	Give them to Refugio.	No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.	Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.	You'd like me to kill them?
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?	Yes, yes.
Stop this, stop this.	Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
Where's the camera?	It's a present from my parents.
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?	Two.	Are there many windows?	Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.	Then it's a respectable house.
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.	So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.	Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
They've got a real hen house here! You can't hear yourself speak.	Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
Don Amalio!	What's that?	Enedina and Paco ...	What about them?	They're playing games behind the couch ...
Which couch?	That one.
Take me there.	Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
Yes, Uncle. How are you?	I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?	Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.	You'll think you're still at the convent.
How long are you staying?	A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.	Was that difficult to get?	No. Mother Superior told me to come.
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?	To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...	You have no feelings toward ...	No.
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.	In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
Come down here, you scamp.	Who is she?	My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.	Come down.
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.	I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.	You see, even the voice.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.	You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.	Only because you want it.
What do you mean?	Nothing. I didn't say anything.
How did you know about that?	Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?	Yes, it is.	Don't you ever see him?	Never.	How could anybody behave like that?	Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...	Evil.	And what do you know about life? When all is said and done you couldn't possibly understand.
His mother wanted to keep him. She came from a poor family. I was in love with your aunt. I would like to have acknowledged him but I was afraid of losing her. That's why I didn't say anything.	And this innocent child.	Don't worry. He won't be forgotten.
You must think I am a monster.	No, but what a pity life is like that.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.	Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.	Thank you, Uncle.
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.	Whatever you like.
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.	Today I can refuse you nothing.
How strange you are! When I asked you to do this favor for me you refused. You seemed almost offended. And now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. Thank you, my child!	I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
You must think I'm mad.	No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.	Wasn't that cowardice?	No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.	It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
Unfortunately ...	It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.	Maybe ...
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.	You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
Leave us alone, Ramona.	Don't go!
You're lying.	No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.	Go away! Leave me alone.
Let me pass!	You must listen to me before you go.	I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.	You disgust me... even if what you say is true.	Then you won't forgive me?
Leave me now. You can go to bed.	Yes, sir. Good night.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?	I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.	What's the matter?
Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?	I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.	Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?	Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.	But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.	Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.	What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.	But what can I say to her, sir?	Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
You believe me, don't you?	Yes, sir.
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.	It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
What will the lady say?	She won't even know.	If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
Is it all right?	Yes.	Enedina's going to take a picture. So we'll have a souvenir.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...	I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
How much is that?	Fifteen yards.	That's fifteen by seven?	That's it.	Good.
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?	The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.	It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.	And in the vegetable plot?	That's good land.
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?	No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?	Tonight, but I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.
Me?	Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.	Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
It's very good.	Thank you; but it's missing something.	That doesn't matter; I like it.
My God, what have you done to him!	He was asking for it.	But why? Why?
Ramona! Ramona!	Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.	Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
What's the matter with you?	Nothing.	Why the bad temper?	It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
She's mad.	No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.	Let her do what she wants. She doesn't bother us in any way. She minds her business and we ...
So, Ramona!	Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
If you wake first, wake me up.	What are you going to do?
What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.	You're happy, aren't you!
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...	I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.	You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this.
What are you thinking about?	That your cousin is more to your taste.
She isn't my cousin.	It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
How in hell does it wind up?	I think I'd better go tomorrow.	Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
You see how much you like her?	That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...	If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
Me, rich? Come on!	There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.	Where's the dough?	Kill him and I'll tell you. If I don't keep my word, you can kill me too. There are thousands of pesetas. Kill him, idiot!
Kill him.	That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.	Why did he kill himself?
I don't know, sir.	One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
And this chest?	There are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.	Why?	You wouldn't be here otherwise.	These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
I don't know -- they've always been there.	That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
Miss Viridiana ...	Are you Jorge?
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.	I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?	It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?	Well... is it so urgent?	If I wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. When you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, I never see you.
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...	But you have a right to let us know what you think.	I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
What do you know about me?	I know that you used to work with an architect.	And do you know that my mother and I had to suffer? If my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I'd be an architect now.
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.	I'm not like you, you have your wife.
What are you doing here? Get out.	Leave him alone.	You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.	Do they worry you that much, then?	They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.	I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.	Is that all you're going to devote your life to?	I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
Are they going to work here too?	Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.	I'll be ready.	Do you intend to stay here for some time?
Yes. Why?	You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
And ...your friend?	She's left.	Is she coming back?	No.	Why?
It's for people!	Then let him go and he'll follow you.	And let him get run over by somebody else?
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.	How much do you want for him?	I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you.
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.	What's he called?	Canelo!
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.	Are you sure it isn't contagious?	They told me it isn't at the hospital.
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.	I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
How are you today?	Things seem to be getting better.	Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through.
Are your parents alive?	Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!	Don't say that.	Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
You'll soon find out, you liar!	Stop this!	He's lying through his ass!
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!	Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?	You cannot leave ...	Why not?	There's been an accident.	Where?	Come with me.
Why are you crying?	I'm afraid.	Don't invent stories; go to bed.	A black bull came.	A black bull!
It's a very big one.	Very, very?	Yes -- very, very big!	He couldn't get through the door, then?
He came in through the cupboard.	You little liar! Get out of here!
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.	Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?	They shut all right now. And the blankets are ready.
What's going on, Moncho?	This louse is looking for trouble.
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.	But, miss ...
You have decided to leave, Moncho.	Yes!	I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?
Mother?	I've just had a letter from your uncle. He won't be able to come when you take your vows.	All right, Mother.
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.	In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.	I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.	I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.	He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...	The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?	Mother.
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.	I had so many things to think about!	A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.	I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.	Are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
Forgive me if I have offended you.	You are forgiven. Goodbye.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?	When you are, miss.	Good, then let's go!
Don't talk like that!	I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?	I've had a gutful of this.	If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody.
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.	Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
What about you, Manuel?	I'm only good at making people laugh.	That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
She looks like a sick marrow!	Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
Ask the priest, miss.	That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
Welcome, miss. I'm Ramona, Don Jaime's servant.	Ah! Pleased to meet you.
How do you feel?	I have a headache.	That will soon pass. It's nothing.
What happened to me?	You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.	Have I slept long?	Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Hello.	Hello.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?	Today, a good girl.	Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
What?	Yes, yes, I saw you!
How did you see me?	From the terrace.	It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?	No, I don't want to.
) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...	Can you tell us what's on the disc?	) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it.
In English, please.	I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
It was very wellhidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.	It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.	Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
You son-ofabitch, I'm going to kill you.	Me? What did I do?
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.	I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.	Jesus Christ.  I know who the dominant personality is.  Lindenmeyer.
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.	Why wasn't I told?
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.	You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.	Whatever.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?	Catch him and your record's clean.
This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.	If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.	Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.	But only you will know he's not human.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?	Madison lives two blocks from their present location.	Why would they be going there?	I don't know.	I wish we could hear them.
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.	He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?	Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.	You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe online, yet?
You all right?	Why'd.. .you pull me out?	Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you.  You may not believe this, Parker,
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?	He was a computer program for crissake.	You were supposed to act as if everything was real.	Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?	Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar  you making it okay in there?	I'm getting by.
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.	Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.	You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?	What about them?	Do me a favor  keep sending them.
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.	Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.	It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee?
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?	I've seen worse.	Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?	If you can catch him.
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.	What she's going to do is get in my way.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.	She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.	Fine  you want to stay here?
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.	Their weapons missing?	Sid 6.7 is now armed.	Where's my gun?
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.	You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.	Then I guess we're even.
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?	On my life, I promise you I will.	If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twentyfour citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.	Any sign of Lindenmeyer?	None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?	Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.	In other words, we collectively don't know shit.
I should have told him.	Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?	I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.	You think he's smart?	Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.	I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?	I need your help--
Why didn't anybody tell me?!	I don't set policy.  You have the key?
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.	Got it.
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?	We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.	What's the assignment?	You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?	Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.	Not if you're with him every step of the way.	The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.	I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you.
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.	Only because I got pulled out early.	Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.
Think you can do it?	Not from in here.	This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release.
What happens if I can't catch him?	If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.	How do you know I won't run?
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!	Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?	What did you find out?	Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.	It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?	No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?	Enough to level an entire city block.	If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.	Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...	Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.	You know how much man power you're talking about?	You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
This better not be a wild goose chase.	Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?	Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell.
What did Cox pull him out early for?	Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?	Don't remind me.
What the hell happened?	Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.	Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.	I was assured the problem was corrected.
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.	Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?	The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.	Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.	I'm still making adjustments...	You've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.	I'M WHAT?!	You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?	I understand... I understand perfectly.
How does he know who I am?	He hears...everything.	As a matter of fact, I do.
HEY!!!	Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.	I haven't been working on anything.	Do I get to see it or not?	Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
Get that fucking thing away from me!	You're...such a wimp.
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.	It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...	Coordinated by polymer neural net.	It feels so.. .real.	It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.	This is supposed to be years away.	As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.	How do you kill it?	Separate the character module from the neural net...
... and you get nanodeath.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.	Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.	I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...
You need a maid.	What I need is a nymphomaniac.
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.	What's wrong with Parker?	How should I know?	Show me his physical sensory level.
I wonder how that...	Turn it down!
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.	Talk so I can understand.	If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.	Then fix it.
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.	Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?	Should I have?	Think hard -- it'll come to you...
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!	True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.	It was you, wasn't it?	It was me, what?	You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!	I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.	My God...	Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.	What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?	I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.	All my work is my finest.
You catching my drift?	I think I understand what you have in mind...
SID  NO!!!	What do you expect me to do, thank him?
I am beautiful, aren't I?	Of course you are.
How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?	Help me get out of here.	Glad to...
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?	I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!	Don't worry. Through me, you will live forever...
You actually listen to all those tapes?	No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?	A little less than yesterday.	In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?	John died.	I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.	You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it  I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.	That's not true, Parker.	If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.	What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?	Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.	You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...	Go to hell.	It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.	Enough!
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.	I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
I don't need a babysitter.	What you need is a collar.
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.	It wasn't a lie.	Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.
You all right?	Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
You ready for this?	Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.	Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.	Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done.	Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.	I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?	I know who would know.
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?	He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.	What happened when he was 17?	Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?	Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
What are you doing?	Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?	You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.	Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.	I'm still working on it.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?	I've been in prison, remember?	The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.	Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...	... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.	I am impressed.	For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.	Who said that?	Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?	He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.	Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.	But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones.
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.	As a matter of fact, it is.
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?	Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.	What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.	In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
Give me your wrist.	Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.	And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.	How did you get your hand out?
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?	I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.	She's beautiful, you know?	Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?	I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.	You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?	Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.	What does that mean?	Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.	Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.	What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.	Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...	You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...	Don't worry about it, all right?	Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...	Relax. I know what you meant.	I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.	Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
Don't get out of the car.	Stop me.
What the hell's going on?!	This is my area of expertise.
What did you do to those people?	Nothing.
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?	Enjoying yourself?	You know I am.	This isn't a game, Parker!	Tell him.
What's the problem?	I'm doing the best I can!
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.	Start of what?	I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.  Whatever it is, he isn't finished...
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.	You like baseball?
Real effective security...	You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?	Authority still makes me nervous.
Which way?	Both.
Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you	If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!	No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!
We know you didn't kill those guards.	They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.	You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
How did you find out about the toxin?	Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.	You're not capable of it.	I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?	I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?	I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.	Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.	Part of him is.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.	Think he's keeping track of his creation?	That, or living through him...
See something?	I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
Nice work.	Thanks.
Find out anything?	A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
Can I ask you something?	You mean there's something you haven't asked me?	You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go  right now.  Why are you going to do this?	You don't know?	That's why I'm asking.	Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
You okay?	...I think so...You?	More or less.	Lindenmeyer?	My guess is dead.	Sid?	I don't know.
Where the hell are you going?	Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
How's your pulse?	I couldn't tell you.	Then shoot him already.	Duck!
What do we do now?	You won't want to watch. Turn around.
Where's John?	Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
The symphony of collision...	The only thing I want to hear is your silence.	I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common  we have such history together I've been thinking we should become friends.
You and me have nothing in common.	Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands?
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!	Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.	GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?	DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?	You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you	Why's that?
What C-4...was Cox talking about?	Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.	Where did you plant the C-4?!
What C-4...was Cox talking about?	Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.	Where did you plant the C-4?!
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!	My...secret.
It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.	I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
There you go  best seat in the house.	You are going after Mayor Bennett.	Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his ReElection Rally...
Aren't you going to watch with me?	I've got some final preparations to take care of Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport.	What are you talking about?	I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty!
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?	BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.	As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.	As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.	Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.	Do they have to look so...robotic?	At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
You want some research, flu?  Side-effects of medi....	Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...
...tonight...	You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...	What if he's busy tonight?	<u>Lure</u> him.	What are you saying...	Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.

And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.	I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.

Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait...	What about tipping off Yurovich?	If I ever need surgery, get me the heart of an arb like Yurovich, it's never been used...Happy Holideals Harold...
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...	Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes...  You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess...
Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.	They don't know what's going on!
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?	Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.	Please, no thanks...	Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.	Oh really.	I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer...What's your favorite drink?
Grand Marnier.	Sounds like a french word, what is it?	It's a romantic and tragic drink.	Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
... That's what you told us to say.	Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
He's lying.	Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.	Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!	Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.	I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...	Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?	I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch.	No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going.
...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?	...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?	...if I had your looks, better.	...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.	...not that you learned anything, Chunk.
Buddy boy, how ya doing?	Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin.
Wanna play some tennis Saturday?	You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...	...you take that Anacott Steel?	...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
So whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at Piping? Meet the membership? I got a little blonde named Mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs... she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins.	...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.	Yeah, where's your machine gun.	Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what?
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.	Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.	Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.	Hey, things could be worse. It could've been my money. Let me help you out, rookie.
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...	Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.	Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?	It concerns his future!	Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life.
...well, see him?	Yeah, but he didn't see me.	Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook Gekko the Great's hand and you still got all your fingers. He's not the only elephant in the jungle.
...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?	...gotta read my reports.	Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there.
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?	Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today.
Got a little action there, eh buddy?	Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.	Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...	Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?	All right, I owe you one Marv.	That's right, next time a little birdie talks to you, talk to me too E.F. Hutton.
What the hell...	Anacott Steel. Buy it.
What's going on?	Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota.
"Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: ""Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe."" Yuk yuk."	Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?	Hey the door was open.	Then get out and close it behind you.	You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.	Get the hell out!
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.	I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it.	Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders.
The stock's going to Pluto!	Start unloading.	Sell?	Now! Tell everyone to dump!
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...	It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me.	Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.	Speak English will ya.	D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.	I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,	Coulda been a contender.	you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.	Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.	You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.	Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.	I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?	50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...	So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...	It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see...	It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?	Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
...Got a 100 on me, you...	Not in here Dad... please. Later.
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...	How's Mom?
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.	...Work okay?	...this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. I got flagged for my blood pressure pills. The only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati. And I was right.
That's great Dad.	Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.	Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all I can advise is hold on to that stock Dad...
You sure about this FAA announcement?	About what?	The FAA announcement.	Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.
What brings you out here...	Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...	Don't start, alright.	Alright. Why so pissed?	Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?
Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.	Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...	...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.	Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.	What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes.
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.	... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?	Whatever night you like.	Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.	Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.	...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear?
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...	I met them before you were born.
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.	No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.	What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.	That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.	Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father.
...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent...	Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please.	I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!	"Your men! All my life ""your men"" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?"
Your words, not mine...	You speak for me, son.
Another cup of coffee?	No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.	I guess it's time to hit the road.	Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.	Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...	What are you doing here?	...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.	First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.	Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
...thanks Natalie.	...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas?	No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made...
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...	What'd you tell him?	I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...	Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.	What if he asks where I got the money?	Tell 'em your father gave it to you.	What if they call him?	They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.	You sure?	Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.	I don't know anything!	Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry.
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.	Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in?	Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.	We are?
So, where are we going?	Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?	Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...	I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?	Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8...  Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield...
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.	So you're hot on this stock?	It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?	Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?	Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?	Nah, she asked the wrong question.	What was that?	"""What are you thinking?""...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt."	"So, does ""this guy"" have a tip for an honest lawyer?"	Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.	Okay.	What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?	Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?	Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.	Yeah, right...	Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.	...and if I did, what's in it for moi?
More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?	Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.	All right, Bud... let's do it.
So what's the problem?	...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...	....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...	Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...	Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?	He never told me...	You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on.
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.	So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these?
So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.	Oh no, no...	Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.	I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...	So what firm you with, pal?	Jackson, Steinem...	...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.	...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.	...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?	Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.	So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.	It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
...rings a bell somewhere. So what?	A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...	...don't like airlines, lousy unions...	There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
How do you know?	I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
My home number's on the back...	Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
Hi sport.	Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...	...I can't even see it...	...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.	Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...	Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.	No sir, that would've been illegal...	Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.	...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.	Excuse me sir.
...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...	Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.	...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...	Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!	Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly...  ...about 50 thousand.
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.	What? How do you know about my father?	The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?	Yes...
Know the name?	'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.	Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.	I remember that deal. You were involved?
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...	I don't understand.	Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...	Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?	Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
What about hard work?	"What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being ""comfortable"", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??"
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.	Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.	...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.	You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.	My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.	...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.	Allright. Wait here...
I guess I'll head back...	"Stick around... Larry, one of my ""gang"" -- Bud Fox."
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.	But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.	"""All warfare is based on deception..."" Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate."	You're learning, sport...
Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.	Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.	"You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - ""a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar."" I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on."	...Gordon.	Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.	How much?	Close to two million.  But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...	I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers...	Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!	I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.	Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.	What does that mean?	The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...	What makes you think you can?	I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.	Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.	A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...	Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.	I'm sorry, this can't wait.
What the hell do you want?	I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.	Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.	You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.	Why do you need to wreck this company?	Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.	If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.	It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.	Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?	Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.	How much is enough Gordon?	The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...	Obviously...
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...	...I can't make it tonight.	Are you with me Buddy?
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.	Dump it.
Hello Bud.	Gordon.	You sandbagged me on Bluestar.  I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.	Excuse me.	Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.	Oh yes, I remember you.	Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.	Aha. Poet or philosopher?	Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.	...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me.	Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.	You could have a great beach house for that.	Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.	Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.	Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.	I gather you're a decorator.	You got it, a great spender of other people's money.	Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place.	Where is it?	Upper West Side.	Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.	Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
What if I have a previous engagement?	Break it.	I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.	You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
So. See you Friday.	You really do believe in destiny?	Only if I want something bad enough.
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?	He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.	How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five.
If I could have anything... this would almost do.	Yeah, almost...
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?	The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.	You have modest wants. I like that in a man.	And what do you want?	...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...	Well, why stop at that?	I don't.	You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
...isn't it perfect!	...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it.
You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.	"I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the ""demolished"" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio."	Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...	I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.	You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.	That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
Do you think you're ready?	It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.	I'll let you know.
Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...	...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.	You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?	Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.	You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...	...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...	So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?	Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride.
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.	Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...	Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.	I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.	At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!	I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.	I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.	What the hell's that supposed to mean?
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...	You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...	I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see.
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...	Get the hell out!
Hi.	Why?	I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...
How you doing Buddy?	Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
Morning Buddy, you look happy.	Any better and I'd be guilty.	You were never that innocent sugarpie.	...how do you know? You wish...
Bud! Where you been the last two days?	...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...	Oh Christ!
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...	Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours.	Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.	Old values. Buy.
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.	No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.	You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.	Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.	It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy.
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.	...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?	Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.	There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.	I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?	No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions.  I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ...
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.	"...that ""scum"" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day..."
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.	Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.	Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?	It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.	Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.	It's over you, Gordon.	You told him about us?	No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.	Now tell me, why would I want to do that?	Because I don't want to see him hurt.	Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?	I can't...and I won't.	Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.	Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.	You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.	You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.	Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!	You got it, G.G.
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.	He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.	Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.	And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.	Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.	Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.	The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...	No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
"You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the ""sir"" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline..."	I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.	Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?	Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.
Are you prepared to put that in writing?	I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days.
Cards are on the table. What do you think?	If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.	You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!	We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night	With Mark?	He still likes you	Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?	He did?	Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.	Businessman?	Businessman!	Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.	Yeah, yeah, OK	Yeah	So why are you dating Jonathan?
But?	But he still has something Mark hasn't.	What's that?	A body.  I mean we're talking major body
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.	Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
Anybody want another drink?	It's eleven forty-five let's go
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?	About what?  About us.	Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.	Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.	A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.	I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?	Yeah well why should I suffer for that?	Suffer?  We're living in America.
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?	Ok toots, I will.
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.	China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
Weird and tiny huh?	Hi
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.	Hmm.	Would you like a closer look?	It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Yes, I guess you're right	Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
Your books Master Loftmore	Thank you Jenkins	And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir	Thank you	And uh, your nicotine sir	Thank you	Allow me sir
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?	Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air	Have a nice day  sir
We're all here, and ready sir!	Jenkins!	Good evening sir.
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?	Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards!
Hello?	Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?	No Jonathan.	No?	She went to a waxwork party	A party at a waxwork huh?	Can I give her a message?	You don't happen to have the address do ya?
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.	Uh, wrong picture Tony.
I hope you enjoyed your visit.	Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.	Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.	They seemed, closing by much	Tony and China?	Vell.  Goodnight.
Haven't we been doing our homework.	I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.	What?  Tony and China, together?	Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.	I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
Then why do you still like her?	Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.	I know what you mean.
No Mark. MARK Why not?	I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.	Come on.	No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.	That's not what you said last night.	Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.	A little?
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!	Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.	Oh that explains everything.	You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.	Big deal!
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.	Who's is all this?
Well?	Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
Well, it all started when a friend and I	China
Sarah listen to me.	Go away.
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night	Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.	Safety in numbers man.	Right.
Anyone else not coming?	Right behind you.
This time I really don't see anyone man.	Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.	This. is killer.
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.	Hi there Sarah
No thank you sir we're fine.	So Mark, what's so urgent?	Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED Oh good share.  I love them
Well?	Well divide 18 into three	Six six and six
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either	Sell my soul?	Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?	You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.	Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
Can this be stopped?	Maybe before the event, never after.
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.	Mom.	One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'	They're all human beings	Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared	Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?	Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college	Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?	When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you	But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY	I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.
Stop saying things so loud!	Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain	You guys are being real assholes
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people	Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays	YES!
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?	Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
Do you have a scarf?	Hey.
Yes?	It's only two hours away.	I know that.	I'll come back all the time.	Of course you will.	I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
That was very good.	Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.	Why?
Besides, Dad would have freaked.	No, he wouldn't.	"I think playing in a band called ""Bitch"" might put a dent in the whole ""perfect family"" thing."	That's not true.	Yes it is.  Can we please not do that? Please?  Cause it is.
He loves you very much.  He just--	I know he does.
Are you mad at me?	Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
I miss you.	So much.	It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.	What do you mean?	I started seeing things.	A ghost?
Did you?	No.  But once I heard...	What?	Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.	Then we both are.
Who's idea was it?	Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
I didn't want to come.	Then why did you?	Because he was worried about me.	Your husband?	Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.	Do you really think so?	No.
Why is he worried?	Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
Fireball?	You're joking.
These are good.	Mm-hmm.
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.	How do you know it's a she?	I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.	What does she look like?	Pretty.  She's a blond.	Do you have any idea who she is?	Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.	Fine.	What do you think I should do?
What?	Try to communicate with her somehow.	You think that'll help?	Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
Are you humoring me?	Nope.
How?	I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
What's happening to me?	Well, that's what we're here for.
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.	Yes, but...	Your friend saw them.	Isn't there something called group hysteria?	You think you influenced her?	Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.	You're saying you willed these events to happen?	I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
"She said, ""You know.""  That I know."	Do you?	No.	What do you think?  Guess.
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--	Have you been hurt?	Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...	You were in an accident?	Last year.  I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  But the car looked bad.  It could have been bad.  I think it scared the hell out of Norman.
What?	That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.	That can't feel good.	"No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of ""empty-nest"" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist."
Of course.  You must be so proud.	I am.	Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity.
How're you holding up?	Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.	Almost.	Wonderful.  It's good to see you two doing so well.
I'm sorry?	I know how hard it can be sometimes.
Uh-huh.  What can be?	Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.	No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.	There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.	At the party.	Toward the end.  You remember?	Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.	Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.	Who's that?	The wives.
Yes?	Um...	I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.	Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.	This really isn't a good time.
Well maybe your wife...	She isn't here.	When...when will she be back?	I don't know.	Oh-kay...	I have to go.
Who?	Give me that shit.  Your wife.	I didn't kill my wife.
Who are you?	It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--	You're the flower lady.	Um...yes.	I've seen you.  From the window.	Is everything alright?
Hello?	I'm not...
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...	Who?  Your husband?	And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
What?  What are you afraid of?	I can't, no, no, I can't...
Tell me.  Please.	That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
Tell me.  I can help you.	How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...	That's not...It's not like that.	I've never even met you.	I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.	This fence...it's so...	I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...	Wait!  Don't go...
I wanted to apologize.	You do?	For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...	And then you weren't there.	Right.  I'm sorry.
Would you like some iced tea?	Very much.
Your house is so beautiful.	Thank you.	And these roses.  They're much prettier up close.
No.	Of what?  What were you so afraid of?	You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
Love.	What?	Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?	Um...sure.	I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
You must think I'm pathetic.	No.  No, I don't.	I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.
Mrs. Frank?	Yeah.	I'd like to talk to you about Madison.	You know where she is?	No, I don't.	Please leave me alone.
What's your name?	Claire.	She never mentioned you.
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.	It's fine.
You look a little old for a student.	I'm not.  We...we met at a party.	Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.	She never mentioned her father.	Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
Why are you here?	I don't know.	It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.	You must have been very proud.
They're calling me in to work.	I should be going anyway.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?	Of course.
What was her major?	Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
Wow.	This is...	We know each other.
He looked like one of the Monkees.	Anyway, Claire slept with him...	I didn't sleep with him.	...just so she could cut them off.	He was so pissed.	I came in from my room...	We were suite mates.	And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.	Oh God...
You should have heard her play.	Stop.	We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.	Do we have to?	And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.	She's making this up.	I'm not.  Couldn't pick up my cello for weeks.
She got it.  Turned it down.	I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
How you holding up?	Good.  I'm good.	You are?	Why does everyone find that so surprising?	Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...	Okay, I'm a little tender.	Well good.  So you're human.	And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.	Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this.
What is it?	Kambucha mushroom tea...	Jody--	It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--	You're discussing me with your psychic?	She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.	Thanks, but I'm fine.	So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
Oh my god.  You bought it.	Yep.	It's niiice.	Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?	Absolutely.	Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?	You got it.
You think he killed her?	I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
Know what I think?	What?	Seance.	Jody, no...	Telling you...	...no...no...no...	Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.	Please.  That's all I need.
Someone's there.	What?	In the window.  Norman's at work.	I don't...
Wow.  I'm losing it.	No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
Sit down here.	Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
Place your fingers on the planchette.	The planchette?	This.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?	I don't know.
Nothing's happening.	Shhh.
Oh...	M-E...
Mef?  What's Mef?	It's initials.  F is Feur.  It's her.
I have to go.	Jody, wait.
Are you okay?	I think so	I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...	It's alright.	I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
Does Norman know?	Jody, she's alive.	What?	Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.	Then what was it?	Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--	Something was there.  You saw it.	Did I?	Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...	Hartford?	And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.	No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.	But Claire--	Please.
Okay.  Okay.	I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
Oh God...you knew.	I was down in Adamant...	Adamant?	Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.	Why?	Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.	Relieved?	I had just been left by Richard.  I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.	Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.	Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.	All of us.
I'm a terrible friend.	No.
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?	What are you going to do?	I don't know.	If she was dangerous before--	She could have hurt me if she wanted to.	You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.	No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
Jody, she tried to kill him.	I know.	I can't believe this is happening.	We need help.  Please let me call the medium.	That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.	Like what?	I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...	What is it?
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.	Did he say that?	Jody he was lying.	What if he was?  Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?	I guess not.	He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.	I don't know...	Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?	I think three...	Three weeks.
What's their name?	Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
She's awake.	We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
When's she out of here?	Norman Spencer.
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.	Don't.	Claire, I have to show up for the--	It's Saturday.
It's today?	Yep.
Claire?	Three o'clock.
Whatcha reading?	Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.	How is it?
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.	Nice.  Almost done.
If you have to work...	No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
How are you?	Fine.	It's okay if you're not.	I am, really.	It's just she's been the focus for a while.	Not the focus.	You know what I mean.
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.	You are...	To get my life back.  To have some time for myself.  Some time for us.
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.	We did.
It's just us now.	I know.
Tired?	Nope.	Wanna fool around?	Yup.
Did you...	Shhh.
And we moved out here for the quiet.	Mmm.
Maybe we should just...	Tomorrow.	I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.	After that.	I'll be there.
Of what?	Of him I think.	Did she say that?	More or less.
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.	I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...	Remember how we were?	Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--	Why?	To make sure she's all right.
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--	That's not what I'm sug--	...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.	But what if something happens?	Claire...	I'd never be able to live with mysel--	Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...	I know.	It's what I've been working for.
I just wish you could have heard her.	Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.	Promise?
Norman, you have to look at this!	Mmnph.	Hurry...
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.	Is it gone?
Hi.	I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
Oh.	Unless you need me to come home...	No, no.  It's fine.
Claire?	Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
What are you doing here?	There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
What do you mean?  Some noises where?	In the house.  I was scared.	Did you call the police?	No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.	Of course.
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.	What kind of whispering?	I don't know.  Just...whispering.
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.	I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
Think I may have cracked it.	Really?
I think so.  Maybe.	You are so brilliant.	Yep.	Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...	You know what that does to me.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...	You're kidding.	He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...	Wow.
"And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, ""Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."""	Well, that's nice.	"""...especially Spencer's Theorem..."""	Oh, no...	"""...of Perpetual Distances.""  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  ""I'm afraid you've mistaken me,""  I say..."	That's...	"""...for my father."""	I'm so sorry.	Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.	That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.	Did you tell her?	What?  No.  No.	You didn't?	Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
Sorry.  You understand.	Did you call about the Feurs?	Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.	Huh.
Get down!  He'll see.	What's going on, Claire?	Shhhh.
He killed her.	What?	He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.	And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--	No, no, no, no.  The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  It's not from here, believe me, I...  All right, look at this.
Our house.	No.  Look!  In the window.
It's a flare.	A flare?	From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.	It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!	It's a ghost.
Where is she then?	She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.	Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this.
See?	What am I looking at?	I didn't do that.	Who did?  Mrs. Feur?	Maybe.  Point is...not me.	Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?	She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--	Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?	Dressed?	Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.	When?	What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...	Oh.	...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?	Tonight?	Yes, tonight.  We're going to be--
When you do this, I swear...	...Don't get all...	...like it never even happened...	Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
What are you doing?	Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.	Five minutes?
You're not at the center.	I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.	We're going to be fine.
There we go.	Well, that's a relief.
I don't need a shrink.	Harvey says he's amazing.	Norman...	What can it hurt to talk to someone?
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.	"I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some ""symptom"" of something..."	I never said...	...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
Are you lonely?	No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
What are you doing out here?	He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--	This is the Feur thing?	Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
How do you know this?	We had a seance.	Who did?	Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.	How did you--	Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
What?	Maybe you resent how busy I've been.	What are you...?  No.	You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.	Sabotage?	Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...	The accident...?	But then you've been so much better...	Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...	Sweetheart--	No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
Keep your voice down.	I will NOT.
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...	Claire, please...
I'm sorry...	Then where is she?
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?	No, it's fine.  I'm fine.	Really big bed.
Do I have everything?	Yep.	Call ya later.
What?	Are you glad?  I'm glad.
You know I am.	Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...	I felt you...looking through me...	We walked all night...	You told me that I was...
You don't remember?	When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
You dropped a glass.	I...	A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...	In the living room...	You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.	But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--	It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.	But I don't remember.	Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.	What's wrong with me?
I may have seen her on campus.	Not personally.	No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.	It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.	The...	Yes.  The ghost.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...	Stop...	...I'm positive this time...	...Please stop...	It's Madison Fra--	STOP IT!
I take it your not mad at me.	Wouldn't go that far.
Ow!	What's the matter?	It's too rough.	Since when?
I don't like this, this...	Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
I think she's starting to suspect something.	Who?	Your wife...	STOP IT!
"""You know..."""	What?
I was there.	Claire--	I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.	Oh God...	I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
It was last year.  We were having troubles.	So you fucked a student?!	That's not what I'm sayi--	DON'T touch me.  Just get away from me. Go!
Claire, please don't...	What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...	I never asked you to quit!	...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.	Who?	To Caitlin!!
Leave her out of this!	And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...	Stop...	...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.	I'm not going to listen to this.
I tried to break it off!	You should have tried harder.	Claire...	Get out of my way.
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...	How did she know where it was?
She did it.	We don't know that for sure.	Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
We have to get out of here.	It's alright.	Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.	She's gone.	What?	She can't be here without me.	How can you be sure?	I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.	Claire...
The leaves...	Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.	Look for antiques...	Yep.  There's some great places nearby.	Adamant.	What?	Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.	Huh.	Do you know it?	Don't think so.	Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
What's that for?	Nothing.	I'm cooking you dinner.	You don't have to do that.	I know.	Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.	Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.	Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!	I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--	I don't believe you.	IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
Mmmuh...	Shhhh.	Mauduh...
What?	MADISON!
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?	:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.	:Would you stop it!	:Well, they are.	":What do you mean ""They"" are? Are you officially a woman now?"	:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.	Then what is he...?	A spacial entity.  An organized energy.  something that precedes our definition of existence.
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.	Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
Thank you for this honor, my dear.	You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.	I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
I have seen him again.  Last night.	But you've not told Michael.
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -	Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
Are you alright...?  You look pale.	I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
There are two.	Two what...?	Two heartbeats.
With his hands!	But why would they do that...?
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!	But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.	Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--	Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?	With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.	Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.	You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.	Come.  There is a lot to read
A what...?	A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?	There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?	Rowan.	Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
Don't tell Rowan about this.	Michael, Rowan should -	NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?
What have the witches always asked of you...?	"""Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."""	Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.	Nothing was ever more false.	Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?	Every day  twice.
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!	What are you talk---	He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child!
Rowan...	You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.	I want to see my mother.
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.	He made that quite clear, yes.	Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.	Nothing worse than a common tool.
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?	Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.	In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -	I don't want it.
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.	Then you wear it.	C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.	It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.	In certain cases, hell is the operative word.	Giff - shuttup.    you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.	"I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - ""make us rich"" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'"	Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!	Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -	Hello...?  Who is this...?	Who is this...?	Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?	I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.
I beg your par---	When did she die...?	Who is this...?	This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -	Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
My...mother...?	Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -	But my mother...  Ellie said she died -	I under5tand.  All the same	-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -	I had you sent away.	Who the hel1 -	It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -	What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!	A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -	When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!	Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -	I'm coming down there!!  And it you put my mother in the ground betore I arrive, you'll wish you'd never seen my face!  IS THAT UNDERSTOOD...?!
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.	I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?	In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!	A Mayfair it ever I saw one.	I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -	I'm tired.  I need to rest.	There are things I have to know!
I don't want the -	Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.	Eighty million doll --- ?	And this - if you decide to take the rest.
What is it...?	The lamplight.  That's all.
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.	Better than most, I suppose.	Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead-
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.	She didn't feel them	You're a monster.
Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.	Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!	You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.	'He'...?
Lasher touched you and you loved it.	It wes a dream...!	Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!	Stop it!	Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.	ENOUGH!!!
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...	You're mad!  Your mind is sick!	...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -	You - are - a - murderer.	But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?	I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -	Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back	The door, Michael.  find the key...	Help us.  Do what you can.
Michael...  Do what you can.	Michael...  Help us...  The door!
Lasher - bring us through!	Now, lasher - it is our time.
Parents say he - uh - fell -	Anybody got a BP yet...?
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -	FAST.	uh - then he - be just -	He just went out like & light-
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now.	I'll tell OR we're bringing -	He's herniating!  Forget OR.  He's dead batore he's oft the elevator Get me a trephine tray -  Anesthesia - stat!  We need him intubated and blow down!
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?	Lie...?	There are things you will not tell him.
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...	Like this...?
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.	Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
STOP!	Always loved you..
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.	I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.	YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!	Explain this to me --- violated...?	You bastard...
Made it...?	It is from love.	To love, you must be able to feel.	If you knew how I yearn for that...
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...	It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?	
You're very clever, aren't you...?	I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---	I bring her flowers too.
There is no one here but the dead.	Go away!  I don't want you here.	If that were true, I would not be here.	It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.	From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. and Deborah.  Stella - Marguerite - Antha  - Diedre -  All of them.  And you will have a child...
A girl...?	It's too soon to know.
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.	What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.	But I could understand. I want to understand!	I LOVE him!	Do not tell me that!	I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
I know that you're evil.	I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...	And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!	No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!	But have I...?  Ever...?!
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.	I love Michael...	Then help me--- for his sake...
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..	Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...	Only you...	Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.	Leave me alone!
What is wrong...?	Wrong...?  Science is not magic.	I do not understand...	You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!	There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.	I don't know what you are!!!	That is what you must discover.   see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am.
No!	Tell me what I am, Rowan.
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?	It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!	They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
Oh god...	Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.	No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...	How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...	ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!	I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -	'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.	I know.    you are my son -
Harder...	Rowan...	Harder...	Like this...  LIKE THIS...?	Yessss...	Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
They like you ------- kids.	I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.	'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?	I'm glad you're around to say it.	My jury's still out on that,	Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?	As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
What do you see...?	Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
Just one.  The bar's closed.	The one time I want it to work...	You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -	You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -	No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
Harder...	Rowan...	HARDER!	Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!	Yessssss...
you're very --- different.	I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
What else did you see- Michael...?	What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.	You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
It's unbelievable that you can do that.	It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.	And whose houses do you design...?	Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...	You still feel that crazy...?
I was born, in New Orleans, too-	Really...?  Your family there...?	Nope-  My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth.   El1ie was my only blood relation.  so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
Too much... too fast...?	Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.	He fools around with his patients too.
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?	It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.	Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.	Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
Why don't you let at do that...?	Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.	Doctor's orders- - -?	Captain's orders.
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.	All I meant was -	You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me.
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -	Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?	I'm serious.  You don't -	Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -	Stop it.	You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
Seems more like a year than a month.	Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.	God knows, I'm intriguing.	Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?		You could fly down tomorrow.  I could be there the next day  I think I can last that long without you.
We're quite a pair, you and I.	Mad. for each other.
Hello...?	Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -	Rowan...?	Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...	What's wrong..?
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -	What about you coming down here...?
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.	Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?	Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.
You know...?	I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
She - she said I - I was a ---	- a witch.
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -	Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.	Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.	Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---	He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!	But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.	Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!	I am!   And so are you.  You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause)  Michael, if you don't want -
Do you love me, Michael...?	Yes.  I love you.  Very much.	I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - with you.
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.	I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
What about your work back home...?	They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.	Let's see.
You sure...?	It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
Everyone - this is Michael curry.	Hello..	Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff---
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.	He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.	Maybe he's just - waiting...	If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
Ro, how long have we known each other.	I don't think of us that way - ever.	Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU.	Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?	No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.	Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.	And I thought I was the mindreader.
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.	That's GREAT!	Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...?
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -	Their what...?	So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
Wanna snack...?	A little wine...?
Hey - you're bleeding.	Dropped it.
You look a little green.	Mm-hmmm...	Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.	Mm-hmm...
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore	Mm-hmm...
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...	Did you see the old man on the ---	Michael!
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?	No.    This is unreal...	It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.	I love you too.
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.	That's cause we're below sea level.	ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.	That's not funny.
You did that, didn't you...?	Talking to me dear...?
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---	- we made a fire.
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?	Your beneficence.	I'm serious.    Whatever it was - it's still there inside me, isn't it - change and all...?
You alright...?	A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?	Lock the door.  Lock it
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?	I don't know.
If it's a boy --- Taylor.	A bit much.    Lucas.	Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.	Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
When aid you get home last night...?	What were you talking about...?	Yyou look terrible.  You're exhausted. You practically live at the goddamn clinic.    Even pregnant women who aren't doctors know that You can't -
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.	Go ahead.
Something's wrong with you.	Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
Hi.	Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?	I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -	Gotcha.
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.	It's not true.  You have to believe me.
I can't.	That's not good enough.  Why not...?!	I can't leave now.  Don't ask me to explain!  I just can't!
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!	Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.	Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?	Stop it!	How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?	You bastard!
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!	Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -	No.
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---	It's alright...it's airight.  He's gone, Michael...  Gone.
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.	I just - hate it when they're - finished.
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.	Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.	On which planet...?	You can't just -	Go away, GODDAMNIT!
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?	The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?	That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
Wow...	If you like that type.
You okay...?	Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
I'm getting --- left behind.	Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?	Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.	Just don't fall off any ladders.
Rowan Mayfair.	Sut McKinley.  Marry me.	I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?	You really love this guy...?	He's got great hands.	Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.	I like him.  He can stay.
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.	Is that a crack about our singing...?	Is that what you were doing...?
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?	Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
We'd better get to work on the papers.	Papers...?	Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -	I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -	No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.	That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.	I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
Which do you think is her best shot...	The one on the left - definitely...	Don't give me shit - what do you want?
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?	As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.	You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.	I heard something like that	Then it's going to be 'I killed for sex'... Listen darling, why won't you let us use your real name for the features - if people knew that it was the ELLEN CARTER writing the features and not just some pseudonym - then we might shift more units. You haven't written anything in four years darling - I know you need this job - and if circulation keeps dropping, there's not going to be a magazine for you to write for...
OH MY GAWD!	I'm sorry - I didn't think	A person could get killed round here just for working late
I thought you were someone else	Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?	Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
Sounds good - thank you	Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE	CHIC MAGAZINE?	Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round.
When could I look round?	Well, if you could come sometime just before we close, then I could show you everything and  then we could go for a drink to discuss the finer points...
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?	BRIAN...	But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN	Yes it is...	Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?	Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock	So there is only one key...	That's right...	And it can't be forged?	I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job	No -it's no problem - I do it all the time	All the time?	No - not all the time - I mean	I know what you mean - I'll meet you at VINNIES WINE BAR at six if you like. And don't make any plans for this evening...
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time	No - I've been abroad for a long time...
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know	Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.	I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?	I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
This must be one of the old keys -	Yes - I have had it for years.
It doesn't mention 'females only'	I really don't know what to say
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?	Sure...	Tell me - ELLEN CARTER  Forgive me for being so pushy, but aren't you a novelist? Didn't you write that terrific book - 'The Color of Fear'?
I lost the touch	The touch?
Do you take sugar?	Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
What are you doing?	I'm sorry?	What's with all the locks - and hammering	It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
My names isn't ANGELA...	Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...	Don't worry - Is that my hammer  Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage...
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen	I think I will pass...
Sugar?	Yes, one and a half please.
So what do you do?	I'm a dentist	And how long have you been a dentist?
Oh, about six years since I graduated	And how many people have you killed?	I don't know	You don't know?	No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't	Where do you kill them...	Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of	my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?	I don't know	Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -	Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?	No she didn't...	What did you do with her?	You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them!
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?	I don't want to talk about it -	OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...	I don't know...	Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?	I don't know...	Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?	Let me ask you, why do you wear black ELLEN CARTER? What are you running from?
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed	Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
How long have you been watching me?	I have something I have to show you...
Tell me about your wife...	My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...	then why did you marry her -	It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
What didn't you like about her?	I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league	I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.	You've killed but you're not a killer	That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
Tell me how it happened...	Why should I?	Why not? Please - it would help me
And how did it feel to be rid of him	Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted	Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?	Did you?
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.	STEPHANIE?	My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -	Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?	STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?	It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
I want it to stop - it all to stop...	Then make it stop...
What?	I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...	Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons	Demons... This wouldn't have been possible without you... You have given me incentive ELLEN - I can see clearer now...
What's wrong?	Nothing could be better...
What's wrong?	I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
What is it?	Open it...
Yes...	You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...	But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...	But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
Where are you going?	Out - I may be some time
We've got nothing to talk about	LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...	I am sorry...
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?	Yes - I suppose so...
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot	No thanks -
First finish your tea...	He doesn't need to...
Why did you let him in?	What was I supposed to do?
I don't like sugar	There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?	It's not that - I just don't want any sugar	Why whats wrong with the sugar -
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE	CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?	Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...	WAIT FOR WHAT!?
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...	You killed my friend!
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?	It's what you would do to me
Don't you want me now LESLIE	No - I'll have you after
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?	At 2.00...
Well, what do you think?	I don't know - it's your house ELLEN	Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?	I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
What's wrong with you?	I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE	What?	You heard me - keep away from him
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!	Yes I can...
I want you out now	Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?	I'm your landlady
What happened?	I had an accident - I fell down stairs...	Is LESLIE here?	No he had to - he's just - he's out...	He saved my life you know - has he told you...
It's been what, three years?	What's this all about?	So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
What brings the rats out of the sewers?	I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...	You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?	At home alone - where were you?	As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?	Get out...
I'd watch her mate - she has thing for men - they disappear near her.	I think you had better leave
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...	Surgery? Are you a doctor?	No - a dentist
Just put it in my room	No worries
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...	Don't worry about it -
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?	And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
Her husband left her	Oh...
I thought it was you - how are you?	I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...	Yes, come on in...
That's good	I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...	Yes, that would be nice - I'll call round some time...
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...	Yes - of course.
Dr STECKLER?	Yes...?	INSPECTOR DAVE TAYLOR - Scotland yard ...Can I have a word?
Dead?	Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.	So she didn't mention anything more about it?	No - she isn't in any trouble is she?	Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand	I'll be sure to...
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...	Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
Sugar?	Yes - one please.
ANGEL...	Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...	You and your pep talks.	Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.	That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.	That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
See? Did you see that?	She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
"The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  ""Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex."" Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it."	Were you always this sick?	One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked.
Someday, I'll find out.	You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.	That's crazy talk.	I defy any and all limits.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.	Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.	Poor Freud, turning in his grave.	Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.	Nobody knows about your mental retardation.	Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.	Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.	And nobody knows you're a virgin!  Aw, who are we kidding...
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?	Astronomical.
Who the hell was your father?	Well, Dad said...
...A bouncer? Are you serious?	Maybe he got promoted.
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!	Cut it out, before you break something!	For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.	Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.	And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.	Perv.
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.	Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?	This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.	Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.	Not ever. Never.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?	I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
So far away? In Xenia?	Yeah, whatever.
Check this out.  Hurry!	I better go, Dad.
Hurry.	What is it now?	Check it out!
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?	Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.	Dead?	Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.	Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.	And some really fast cars.
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.	It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.	I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...	...where they get all the really good porno channels on cable.
Oh, how inappropriate is that!	Take a whiff of heaven.	How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?	I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--	Give me those!
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.	Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
You're late, bro!	Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.	You'll never believe who's in there.	It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.	With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
I thought I loved her.	Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!	No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.	And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.	I love those springy head puppies!
Get them together.	Brilliant!  Molly, give me all you've got.  For Merk.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?	We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.	Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.
You got everything you ever wanted.	Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
"Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called ""Heaven."""	This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
Never say never.	Oh, god.  Look. Look.
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.	Let me get this straight...	If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.	These are real, live women?	We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.	God, I love being dead.
What gives, Don Corleone?	We reinvented ourselves.	New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.	You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.	That explains the emptiness that haunts me.	Jealousy is so unattractive.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.	He kicked major ass and you know it.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?	From your lips, to God's ears.	You go first.	Ladies first.  I insist.	Well. The prom's coming up.	Yeah?	And I was wondering.	Yeah?	If you don't have...I mean...
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?	SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
Ted, have you lost your mind?	You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.	I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.	But that smile.	Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.	So you'll think about it?
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!	So that's a maybe?	The answer is NEVER, Ted, NEVER. Except maybe in your dreams.
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.	Yeah? You like?	Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
Hi, Teddy Bear.	"Christy?  You want to be in ""Heaven?"""	I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.	I do? I mean, yeah, I do.	I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.	Do it?	You know...take the pictures?
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.	Which you pulled, hard!	"That was code for ""I like you."""
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.	I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.	Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
Well?	You have changed since second grade.	I mean, what do you think?	You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.	Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.	Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.	Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces.  Are you hungry?
God, you are so hot.	Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.	We own a small family grocery store.
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?	Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
Sweetheart, what is it?	I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.	Oh, honey. We can't accept this extravagance.
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.	We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.	We love our lives just the way they are.
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.	But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.	Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
"We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called ""flesh parties"" you attend. But we can get past all that."	We miss you. We miss our son.	We miss our family.
We think you should give up the magazine. Sell it. Let someone else run it. Whatever it takes.	We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.	It's my private business! Mine!
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.	Dad, please.	Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.	Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?	You're way ahead of me again?	It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.	The lesson being?	Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.	I'm getting so good at this.
You guys are my parents.	Of course we are.	They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...
Son.	Well, why should I?	They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.	I guess.	They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.	Yeah.	Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?	I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.	Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.	"Like one of those ""National Geographic"" specials with the topless chicks?"	Whatever helps you cope.	I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.	There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...	...not the pit.
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.	Just say it, Dad.	I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?	Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.	Well, good. Every little bit helps.
Finally, some gratitude.	We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.	Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
Sorry I--	It's okay. You need me?	Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?	You ordered a Winnebago?
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.	Watch your tone, mister.	Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.	I will not have my boys arguing.
I-I don't have the keys.	They're in the ignition, silly.
You do know how to drive?	I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.	Want a lesson?
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.	Got it.
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.	I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.	It's your car. These are all your cars.	Some of them have to be automatics.	"Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. ""Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."""
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.	I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.	The one with the horses.	That's me.	I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?	Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.	Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.	Hi ho, Silver.
Who exactly ARE you?	What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.	And who IS Ted Nelson?
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.	I always knew there was more. I felt it.	Then remember, you are the heir to a billion dollar empire. You have a staff of literally thousands. Multiply everything you ever imagined by a million and you still can't even wrap your head around everything that is yours. ALL YOURS.
Teddy? I was thinking.	Hmmm?	After graduation...maybe we could go away together?	Whatever you want.
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.	Of course we were.
Ted! Do something!	What do you want me to do?	This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!	Hang in there, I'll think of something.
Well?	I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!	But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.	But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.	If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.	We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
Can you believe that was me?	Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.	So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.	Everything.
You're on the next plane home.	I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?	We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
It's a little more serious than that, Bill. The stockholders have requested a meeting. They want our guarantee that this will never happen again.  Some of them are even calling for Ted's resignation.	Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.	You mean they knew who I was?	They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them.
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.	"Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded ""Heaven,"" they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours."	My legacy.	Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.	They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.	I understand.	"And the girl I love, she hates ""Heaven."" If I keep it, she'll never respect me."	But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?	Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.	Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee?
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.	"What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in ""Heaven?"""
"Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of ""beauty."""	I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?	"Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, ""The Girls of Xenia."" Just to show my appreciation."
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.	Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
James, what are you doing here?	You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.	Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?	She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.	It's really late...do your parents know where you are?
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.	Most places are, Jimmy.	They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.	So, what brings you here at his hour?	My new bike.	Very funny.	I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.	My room?	Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.	It's not up to me.	Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.	You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
If you could just sign right there.	You want it in writing?	Just a formality.
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.	Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.	Are they okay?	Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.	I miss them, too.	You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.	You're a peach.	Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
He was my Grandfather, too.	I meant biologically.	That's a crappy thing to say.	Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.	I didn't forget.	"You ever look down on them again and call them ""grocers"" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?"
Great.	From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.	That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.	Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!	The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning exposé changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?	"Look, I loved ""Exposed!"" and I hate it that you got busted. I know the school paper sucks in comparison, but it's really not THAT BAD."
Don't even tell me you're hot for Miss Titty Pom Poms over there.	Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.	I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.	Me-ow.	Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.	I have absolutely no intention--	--Do it. I triple-dog-dare you.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.	But you triple-dog-dared me.	It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.	It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?	Your article sucked.	In what sense?	"In the sense that there is no ""hidden agenda"" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs."	Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.	Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.	Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.	I'm trying to help.	I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.	That's not ENTIRELY true.
What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.	Then I'll write about YOU.	Me?	"""Local boy inherits more money than god."" Call me crazy, but I smell human interest."	Really? You wanna write about me?
I have to admit, I always felt... different.	Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?	I don't get the distinction.	Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?	I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.	I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.	I guess.	Interesting.
She said peanuts, you cretin.	You never know around here.
Don't write that part.	Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?	Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.	Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.	"Funny you should say ""peachy."""	I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.	My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.	Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.	I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.	See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.	And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.	A little respect would be nice, that's all.
Well? What do you think of her?	You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.	You're implying she's, what, a gold digger?
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.	Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.	Why can't you be nice to me?	You've got enough people kissing your ass.
Wow...you clean up nice.	Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
Where are we going?	To the best hiding place in the world.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.	He didn't. He had it built.	Whatever.	"Not ""whatever.""  It's two different things."	He cared enough to want you to have it.	He phoned it in.	I see.	I doubt it.	Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.	The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.	You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?	Your dad taught you everything.	I mean my father.	A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.	It's all so complicated.	It's incredibly simple.	I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.	Eventually you'll let go.	And then what?	Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.	You're amazing.	I know.	Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.	But you never do.	If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.	In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.	"That's two words. And I'm out of the ""exposed"" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout."	There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.	You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.	He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.	Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
That's probably my office.	Well? Where the hell are you?	He's on the move?	I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.	Let's do it.
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.	You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?	At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.	Amen to that.
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.	I'm trembling with excitement.	That has more to do with your proximity to me.	My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.	I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.	I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.	Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.	Wearing them?  Or humping them?	My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.	That's refreshingly deviant.	What about you?	I'm very aural.	Tell me more.	Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.	I see.	I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.	"A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very ""Cosmo."""	You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.	Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.	You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Do you trust me, Julie?	Not a chance.	Come on.	Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
I want you to trust me.	Maybe someday.	Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.	That's hard to believe.	But absolutely true.
"I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise ""The Girls of Xenia."""	I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.	I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.	Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.	You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.	"Which explains the continued success of ""Heaven"" for how many decades?"	You're quick. I like that.	You think you're working with chimps here?	The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.	Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.	I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.	I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college, learn a few things, you know.
"And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a ""coxswain."""	Very ambitious. I like that.	The thing is, I'll need a first mate.	I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?	"I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called ""EXPOSED!""  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio."
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.	Yellow pages?	Let your fingers do the walking.
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?	You better.
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?	No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.	I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
That's part of growing up, honey.	What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.	Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.	Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?	Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.	Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.	It's okay, Mom.  Trust me.
Well? Surprised?	What is all this? When are you coming home?	Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.	Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.	Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?	Only the best for my mother.	You promise you'll finish school?	I'll make you very proud.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.	But how would we pay our bills?
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.	Oh. Goodness.	You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!	Like what?	Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
But who would run the store?	Forget the store. Think big.
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?	Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.	"Don't say ""shit,"" honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you."
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.	Thanks, Principal Merkin.	I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.	Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.	Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.	You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?	That's a good start, yes. A very good start.	Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.	I never figured you for a pimp.	"Have you ever even looked at ""Heaven?"""	What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.	I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?	We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!	"If that were true, this would be one seriously constipated town. Most guys in Xenia have been looking at naked girls in ""Heaven"" since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress."
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.	Rules are rules.	Come on, it's our only senior prom.	Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.	A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?	I'm warning you.	A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.	Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.	What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?	Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.	You called the cops on us?	Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
Smashing!  Welcome to the family, Ted. You are going to breathe some new life into this place. You are going to set the world on fire! You are going to...call me Uncle Billy? Please?	Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.	I have only one concern...
You do like girls, don't you?	Of course I like girls.	A lot? I mean, a whole lot?	As much as possible.	You're sure?
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.	Seldom? No kidding?
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?	Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.	I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.	Tipping?
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?	Yeah.  Everything's cool.
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.	Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.	They said that? Really?  Oh, your parents. The Nelson's. Right, right. How midwest. I like that.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.	YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?	All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.	Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!	I do?	You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.	Me? The King of Coitus?	The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.	Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...	Why, look who's here.
I told you you could do it.	I was like a different person tonight.	You were the new and improved you.	I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.	No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.	It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.	You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.	Really? You'd do that for me?	I've been very lazy for a long, long time.	You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.	I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.	My parents always say hard work builds character.	It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.	What kind of ideas?	"Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of ""classic beauty."""	You think we should be more open minded?	The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.	In other words, our scope is too narrow.	At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.	That's perfect.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.	I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.	Really? So I'm doing OK?
My father must've been amazing.	He was in a league of his own.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.	I can't wait to see the pictures.	It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?	Seriously? I'm doing all right?	"You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this ""stuff"" spoil you."
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.	I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.	Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.	You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.	Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.	You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
Yes?	We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--	--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
What are you doing?	My job. Back off, Benedict.
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.	"All is fair in ""Heaven,"" Ted-baby."	That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.	Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
In a hurry, are we?	I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?	Bad news.	People pay good money for that?	I'm just a messenger.
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.	It's about your parents.
My parents? What do you mean?	I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.	You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.	Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
How quaint.	It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
"Are you familiar with ""Heaven?"""	I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.	"Your fathered owned the entire ""Heaven"" empire.  You own it now. Any questions?"
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?	I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
Talk to me Artie.	Kelly Van Ryan...	... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...	Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...	This is insane.
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...	That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.	The Van Ryan family created Blue Bay. They built the school... Sandra Van Ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  You're gonna need some help on this one, Sam.  You're gonna need a lawyer, and he'd better be a good one.
How you doing, Artie?	I... You know... I...
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...	Eat a power bar.
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?	Kelly.	She's going to wash your Jeep?	Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
You look pretty.	Thanks.
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.	And where might that be?	I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.	I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.	I'd like that.
How soon can we get something?	We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
Merritt, Forensics.	The teeth doin' any talkin'?	Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...	What about the blood?	Could be hers.  Types match.  Could be a lot of other people's too...	Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.	What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?	Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?	I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.	About Suzie?	Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.	He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.	She still work there?	No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.	Was there ever any kind of investigation...
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.	And the child...	She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...	Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...	Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters.	And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
You okay?	I'm fine.  Nice TV.
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?	I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.	I know you do.
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...	Take your time.	They were in me.  Both places... you know.	I understand.	"He said something like, ""Do you want it dirty7"" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor."	Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?	Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...	That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?	No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...	He was large?
Did you try to fight him?	I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'	Then what?	"He kept saying, ""Let it happen, let it happen.""  Then he just stopped."	You mean he withdrew...	Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.	Try, Kelly.	"I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, ""Don't worry, I didn't come."" I can't forget that.  He said, ""No little girl can ever make me come."""
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.	I'd like that.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?	Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?	No.	Weren't you a little worried about her...?	There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?	Suzie Toller is missing.
How long?	She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.	Maybe she used another name.	Ray thinks she was murdered.
I don't know what to say...	You could tell me where you were last night.
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.	Suzie?
I've got that two o'clock in town.	Back to the land of grownups.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?	All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
It's our job, Gloria.	Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.	Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there.  Same with the kids.  They saw her running down the street, but that's it.  With no physical evidence, what do we have?  Her word against his.	You're telling me you believe the guy?	All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.	Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?	The skinny brunette.	This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.	You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.	It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
You saw the news today?	Lombardo's settlement?
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.	Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.	I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...	Unless what?	Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.	Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...	The job looks okay to us.  But look at it from his point of view.  The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...	Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?	I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.	Eliminate the competition.	You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?	I net a guy in a bar.
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.	What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
Guess I kind of lost it there.	You could say that.	Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
We all have...	I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...	Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?	You have someplace to be?
If you want company...	Just check out the car.
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.	Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.	Where's the body?	The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.	You don't think Sam could've put it there?
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.	We don't know that, Ray...
Will you do me one favor?	Ray, you heard him...	What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...	And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?	If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.	Where's Lombardo?	He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.	The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.	It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it.  I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track...
That bothers you?	Yeah, maybe, a little.	Why is that?
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.	We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
About a year ago.	He dropped Jimmy off first?	Yeah.	And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?	No.	So you were alone.	Yes.	Did he come in with you?	I guess.
At that point were you able to fight him off?	No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
He did say something.	What was that?	"He said, ""No little bitch can ever make me come."""
Why?	I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...	Where's this coming from?	I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
I want a full-scale investigation.	You know what that will mean for Lombardo.	I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case.
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...	The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.	What about witnesses?	We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.	And what do they say?
Are you crazy, Ray?	"You heard Kelly say ""Sam.""  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls..."	Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...	I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
Oh, Ray... no...	You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  And those girls are going to wind up dead...
Kelly's next, Gloria.	Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?	Just tell us what happened.	I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did her rights.
She bit you?	Bit, scratched.  But I had her pinned. She calmed down.  I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick.  She asked to use the bathroom.
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.	You didn't cuff her?	She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
The teeth, were they...	Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?	Yeah... okay... he did	And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...	I wanna go home now.
What did you do then?	Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...	Suzie!  Did this man rape you?	Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.	I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?	Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
Ms. Toller?	I said he did.	Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
This wasn't my idea.	I'm sorry?
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.	Your Honor... Please...
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?	No!
Thank you, Jimmy.	Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class...  No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...	Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?	What?	A ride.  You want one?	Yeah.  But I got my bike.
It's those rocks, up there.	You and Suzie used to come out here together?	Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?	Lombardo ever come out here?
I say something funny?	No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...	Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...	Yeah, but...
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.	Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...	Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.	Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?	I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.	You can trust me.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?	Oh, for Christ's sake.	You are.	Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?	What brain?
What are you looking at?	Nothing.
I thought we were goin' to a movie.	I think we just need to get wasted.
I wanna live at the beach someday.	Shit.
Is there some reason why you're here?	Curiosity, I guess.	About what?  How to improve your breast stroke?
Excuse me?	You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.	You're out of your mind.	I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.	Police -- God -- get a life.
Get off my property.	I'm not on your property!
Is that Sam Lombardo?	Hi, Mon.	Sam!  Hi!
"Which one of your ""bodyguards"" is that?"	Whichever one I want.
Okay, what's the matter?	You notice my new jumper?
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.	I would hardly say you look like trash.	No thanks to you.
Kelly.  What is it?	I miss Dad.	Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...	No you don't.	He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
What?	I was raped.  By Sam Lombardo.
He... Sam Lombardo?	Yes.  God, Mom...
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...	I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.	Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.	Where, the mall?	A friend of mine bought a boat.
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.	Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
Don't forget the car wash.	I won't.
Look, he forgot.  I knew it.	No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.	In back of the garage.
So, where you off to now?	Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.	Jeez, that thing... Can't you...	Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
All right.  I'll have to look for it.	Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
Kelly...	Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust.  How do you like that?  I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you...	Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?	So you got my mom's money.
How much?	About six and a half million dollars.
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.	Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...	Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...	Do it to ourselves?	We have to stick with the plan.	Stick?
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?	Yes.	Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?	Why can't you come...	No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...	You know what it takes.	Then do it.  I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight.  We'll figure something out... Okay?
I'm here.	Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it...	There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
Hello?	Hello.	God, I've been calling you.
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.	Duquette.  Forget him...	I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...	Yeah, he got her busted for possession...	I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...	And you believe her?	I don't know.  I want to see you...	Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.	But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.	Okay.  I love you too.
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.	That's not your line.	Say you love me.	I love you.  Now give me the line.	No little girl can ever make me come.
I'm running away.	You think that's wise?	Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
But check this...	Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
Good thinking.	You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...	Forget it.	Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.	I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
Can't you take that stupid thing off?	Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.	What's that supposed to mean?	For you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... It doesn't add up.  Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em running scared.  And I'll tell you something else, you rush, you get careless.
Nellie Gail Ranch...	Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.	There's nothing for them to get.	Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...	I just want my life back...	Fair enough.  Let's go make a statement.
Come on, let loose!	I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.	You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.	Just like that?	Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.	That's right.
Who is it?	Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
Where is she?	Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?	I'm placing your daughter under arrest.	You can't...	Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.	I did.  At Blue Balls.
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.	So Suzie, you called us, remember?
No.	Will they?	It doesn't look like it.	Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.	You got something against cigarettes?
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...	That's cop bullshit.	Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.	About what?	Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.	Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?	You, Kelly, Sam.	I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?	I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...	Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
Get away from me.	Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?	Shut up.
Davy.	That's right.  That was his name.
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...	Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
Sam, for godsake.	Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.	Story's the same, Detective...
I had to go look for this coupon.	The one you bought at school.	Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.	In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.	Yes.	And she wanted to talk.	Yes.	But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.	I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.	And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.	Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
But she ran away.	That's right.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?	It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...	With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra...
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.	Sit down, Lombardo.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?	The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?	Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.	Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
You mean this thing?	Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.	I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?	Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.	Yeah, or get me drowned.
Jesus, man... You okay?	That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...	Come off it, man... It was an accident.
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?	Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Sam...	Put Kelly on too.
But I..	Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
Yeah, right.	Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.	Are you mad at me?	No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight.
That was about as grim as it gets.	The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.	But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...	But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
What?	That was the same thing Ray said.
What's wrong?	Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.	Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.	Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?	We?	Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already.
How...	Walter.  He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years.  I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.  I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass.  What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?	I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them.
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?	Hi, Sandy.	Why don't you come in, have a drink?	Can't.  Got a passenger.
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.	I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...	Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.	What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...	Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
Sandy... What's up?	Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?	No.	Shit. Here we go again.	Didn't you see her this morning?	To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?	So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.	Goodbye, Sandra.
J. S. Bach.	Jim West.	Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.	I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?	Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.	Funny.  So am I.	Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.	Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.	Interesting.  Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?	Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.	If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
But don't pull that again.	Wouldn't dream of it.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...	Put them all together and what do we have?	A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.	Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?	"""Ay, there's the rub.""  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy."
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...	Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.	"""Gadget guy?""  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science."
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.	You need that real often?	Always hoping.  Or this...	No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.	Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!	All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.	Try what?
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.	Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
That should put us ahead of the criminals.	I'll work on it.
Aha!	Aha?	Yes, aha.  A brass screw.	Is this leading somewhere?	Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.	Starting with a screw?	Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...	What about the explosive?
Limestone quarry?	Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.	Absolutely.  Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.	Prepare what?	My disguise.  And here...
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.	Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.	Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet.
That's a lot of butler.	Quite.  Come, let's mingle.	Do your own mingling.  I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.	Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.	All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...	Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.	Almost?	Yes.  Now, observe....
You feeling all right?	Come on, Jim.  I'm serious.  Dot...  Dash.  It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
Now, what was that?	"You're either having a seizure or you just said ""hello."""	Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
What was all that back there?	All what?	All that jumping and kicking.	That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.	And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.	I'm going to hit you.
Never seen a gun fire so fast!	It's a repeating steam cannon!
At least I tried something.	Hey, I tried the board.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.	At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.	That's right... That's good.
Jim, are you all right?	No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.	Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas.  Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works.
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?	What way is that?	So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.	"""Spontaneous.""  I like that.  Most people say something like ""hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."""	Well... that, too.	Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
So... what happened?	Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.	Uh... how long ago was this?	I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
You might have mentioned you had that.	I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.	I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
They're so precious when they're asleep.	You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
Can you fill me in here?	Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.	Thank you.	Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.	You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.
Know what this is?	Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.	A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
This is good.	Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
Oh, damn!  That's it.	It's better than nothing.	It is?	He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard.
No record of him.	You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
What's this?	Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.	Yes.  And a much nicer one than ours.
Willard...	It's not a guy...	It's a town!
"Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was ""damnably hot."""	That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.	Relax.  We're almost there.	We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
What is that?	This?  I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.	And people are actually fooled by that?	My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
Not again.	I adjusted it.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?	You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
When we find him, he is mine.	Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?	Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.	Oh, thank you.	My pleasure.
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.	What?  President Grant is...!	I know!  I know!	I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!	We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.	I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?	There's only seventy-eight.	Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
It was in your book.	Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
Are those just button buttons or...?	Of course not.
My hat is off to you, sir.	Thank you.
God in heaven, what is that?!	That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
My God!  He's so excessive!	Where have you been?
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!	Oh, I see, an easy plan!
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!	He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!	All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.	In the next two minutes?
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.	What is this?  A whole new train?	Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.	I'm sure we will.
Terribly sorry.  I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  Federal agents, ma'am.  We're rescuing a kidnap victim...	Yes, me!	You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.
You didn't tell us you had this on!	My Lord, he was telling the truth!
He calls it the Tarantula.	But it only has six legs.
He's not giving up?	Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.	Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
A new friend?	We'll see.
Anyone?	Here.  Mr. Tyler.  He claims a certain skill at handling firearms.	Wonderful!  Our new friend from the wild west.  Please...
I could get used to this, looking down on people.	They don't even realize they should be frightened.	Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.	I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.	You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.	I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.	Really?	Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.	My... the wild west.
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.	Your guests, ma'am?	Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.	Well, I owe you one, don't I?	You most certainly do.
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.	I don't like to lose, either.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?	You tell me.	I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.	Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.	Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?	I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.	Would that include me?	Oh, I would hope not.
You've... done... this... before.	I've had some practice.
She's perfectly safe.	Really?  Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
My.  It's gotten longer.	You bring the best out in a man.	I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.	Fine, I'll stop.
Look, I'm Captain James West...	Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Your private train, sir.	Private train?	That would be correct.  Orders from the President himself.  Trans- portation at your beck and call. No delays.  Although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.	My friend?
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?	I would, Mr. Doyle!  Are you game?
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?	Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.	Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...	French?	Yes sir.	French?  Damn it, I want my own man on this case.  Somebody I trust. Somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...	A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.	That'll be all, boys.
Good work.  Really.	This is Colonel Richards.	Nice to finally meet you, sir.
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.	Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!	Nicely said, sir.	Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...	And?	And now the job's yours.
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?	On my way to Denver...
Where'd he say he was going to do this?	He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
I admire a man with a sense of humor.	When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.	Thank you.  I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have.
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.	No, sir... just a businessman.	Really?  Must be a dangerous business.	I deal with some tough customers.
Sir... I believe you have only two barrels.	How embarrassing.  Did I hold up three fingers?
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.	Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!	Dr. Loveless?
You're not that big.	Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.	He had a pressing engagement.	Philistine.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.	Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!	Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.	Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.	That would be... the Mexican War?	Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
I've even printed my own currency.	"""Emperor Miguelito...?"""	The first.	Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?	Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!	So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
Easy now.	Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
Dr. Pemberton?	Yes!
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.	Who were they?  What do they want with me?	We'll explain on the way.
"I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the ""rare and unparalleled opportunity"" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do."	Who was this partner of his?	A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.	A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
Are you all right?	For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?	He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
This is something.	It's a smelting retort.
Now it's a bomb.	It is?
I beg your pardon?	You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
Well?	They're coming.	When are they coming?	They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?	In an hour they're gone!
Hey...!	You're not going to use it, are you?	Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...	Right.
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.	He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?	Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.	Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.	Hey, remember?  You don't need my help, Madmartigan.  Little rabbit trap like this?  Come on!  I could open it for you, but I wouldn't wanna insult you!	Gimme a sword, Airk.  I'll win your war for you.
You left me to die, friend.	You managed alright.	Is this what's left of your army?
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?	They're not after me.  They want the baby.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?	Then come with us.
You're chasing a dream.	Just get me some horses.
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?	Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Thank you, friend.	Let's go.
Willow Ufgood.	Yes...?	I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?	She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.	Me?
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.	What is Tir Asleen?
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.	You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.	You are very important, Willow.	No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.	My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
They look like acorns.	Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.	Not today, Willow.	It's a matter of great importance to me!
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.	My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.	If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?	You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.	I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!	Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
Go in the direction the bird is flying.	Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!	Waste magic on revenge?  You have much to learn, Willow...
You!  Are you the mother of that child?	No.  I mean yes.
I can't.	Let me see it.
I can't.	Why not?	Why not?
Gawd...you're...beautiful...	You're not a woman.
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.	My step-father's going to tear you apart.
I do what I'm told.	Too bad you're not more like your father.
You're a fool.  Now put her back.	I'm not going to let this baby die.
Why did you say that?	Say what?	I love you.
Because it's true.	I don't believe you.
Sorsha.	Madmartigan.
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.	I have no family.
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?	He's no magician.	He turned that monster into stone!
Then you get us out of here.	I will!  But I need help!
Who is that girl, anyway?	Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
We're a tiny version of all that?	As above, so below.
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.	Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.	Good.  How long will it take?
Don't make me angry, Peck.	You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.	Miserable Pecks.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?	Why.	I have to give this baby to some- body.
Hey!  Somebody's coming!	Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Thanks for your help, Peck.	Are you okay?	As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!	I don't know.
You a woodcutter?	Farmer.	Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic- tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world.
You all right?	These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
Smells like a battle.	Are you a warrior?	The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
What's that?  I hear something!	You hear trouble.	What is it?
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!	Friend of yours?
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?	I hate this.
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why?  Nobody cares...  Except me.  You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.	You don't know anything about ba- bies.
You gotta promise to feed her.	I will.	Fresh goat's milk.	Absolutely!
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.	Of course!  I promise!
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.	Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
You!!	Where the hell did you come from?
Hey!  Give me that baby!	These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.	Nursemaid?!
Time to change her diaper.	Time to leave.
Because she's sick.	Because she's sick.
Where's the baby??	I thought you had her!
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!	Elora Danan!
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!	Madmartigan!  You saved her life!	I did?
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.	Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.	The Fairy Queen?  And the baby here's a princess?  And these two rodents are your guides?
Madmartigan, I need your help.	My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!	You?	Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
I'll help you...!	I won't.
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.	The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Did she ask about me?	Who?	Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything?
She said lots of thing.s	Willow!
She asked about you, Madmartigan.	Well what did she say?
She's in love.	You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
You?	What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.	Want me to carry Elora?	I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?	She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.	She's a bird, Willow.	That's my fault, not hers.  I've got to keep practicing.  I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--	Watch it!	Ahhh!
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.	Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!	I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
I don't know, Willow.	Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
It's not a Nelwyn baby.	No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
Can't we keep it, Dada?	Absolutely not.
Dada, what's a daikini?	Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.	Are you scared?
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!	What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
Who are you!  Who are you!	I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
What do you want!	We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
Kill him!	No!	Kill him!
Did *you* give that acorn its power?	No.	A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it.
You must learn magic.	That's all I ever wanted!	Then I will teach you.
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!	What do I need for that?	We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?	Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...	I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?	As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
I'm all finished.  Now what?	Burn it to a fine ash.
How am I gonna do that?	Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!	I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!	What's the magician's weapon?	The limitless power of...
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?	I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?	The art of transformation!
But what am I gonna transform??	Me!
Oooh, this smells terrible.	That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
Ouch!!	Shhhhh!
What'd you bit me for!!	We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?	His will.	Now use it.
I just wanted to test it first.	No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
Tir Asleen.	There's nobody here.
How??	Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!	More!  More!
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!	You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!	Why?	Just do it!
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!	No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!	She's too powerful, Raziel
Time is running out.	Surrender!!
Patience, Willow.	Courage, Willow.
Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.	Somebody has to do it.
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.	He never misses.
I'm not going in there.	Me neither!
Are you sure?	Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
We gotta follow them.	Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
Get back here, Rool!	Ouch!  Let go of me!
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.	Shut up.
She needs to be changed.	I changed her already!
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.	Who is that horrible friend of yours?	Madmartigan.	Who is he?	I don't know much about him.
She's hungry.	I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.	Here.  Hold her.
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.	Queen Cherlindrea?	She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.	Who??	You're the guardian, aren't you?
I'm getting her out of there!	No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
Ohhh, I hate this.	Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.	Why not?
This is not going well.	Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Talk!  Say something!	I can't see anything--she's too bright!
Hey, careful there!	How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.	How are we going to get out there?
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.	The sorceress.
Obviously.	Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.	Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?	Maybe milking.	Milking?	Cows. You know, cows?	I've seen pictures.	Good, you start tomorrow.
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?	Not one this big.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?	Guess I'm not used to so much.	Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company	Sorry. It's important.
Where's Timmy and Buck?	Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?	You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?	That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.	Oh sure, Fred.
Who are these orphans, anyway?	They're Amish.
Put my car in the garage and close the door.	John, I don't understand any of this.	You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.	John, why?...	Just do it!
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?	I thought I was the English.	English, Yankee. It's the same. My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.  You look plain, Book.  Very plain.
I came to see Rachel Lapp.	Try the house.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.	It's been a while.	No matter. Come with me. We can always use a good carpenter.
Your hole is healed, then?	Pretty much.
Nail it!	Yes, sir.
Everything is all right, John.	Pick up the hat.
I saw him.	Who'd you see?
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?	No... I saw the man who killed him.
He was... like him.	Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?	No pistol. Ever.	Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.	Okay, Mr. Book.
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.	You don't say.
Hey, Sam...	...I want to say a thing.	What's that, Sam?
Is it them?	It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.	Are they going to kill you?	Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!	What are you going to do?	I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
Don't let them hurt you.	I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Are you really ever coming back?	Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.	Have you got your gun on now?	Sure have, Sam.
How reliable is this kid?	Oh, he's good.	Amish.	Yeah.	What have you got?	Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight  street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.	So one of them got to him.	Maybe.	You know who?	Maybe.	You're still convinced there's a link to the department?	If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.	That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.	The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.	When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.	Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde  what's-her-name  come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.	What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.	Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.	I hope you don't have any doubts about that.	If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.	Who else knows?	Just us.	Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up	More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.	Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
What's your first move?	A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
Who else knows?	Just us.
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.	How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.	I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.	Johnny 	You might want to pass it along to Mac.	Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in 	I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you.
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.	Don't try me, Johnny!
It's all over, Paul.	Move! Or you die right here!
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?	Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.	There'll be another train.  The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there.
Where are you taking us?	We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.	You have no right to keep us here.	Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.	You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!	Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.	It's not a joke.
What was that?	He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
Now what's the problem?	The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
Whacking?	Yes. And I also want to leave this city.	Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.	We do not go into your courts.	People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...	No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.	They kid a lot.	I would not be too sure.
But not a good tired.	What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
Your sister said you don't have a family?	No.	She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
Oh? Anything else?	Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?	Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
But why would they murder...	Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.	I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.	You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
Where are you taking us now?	Home.	You couldn't wait until morning?
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.	I was wrong.
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.	I can't.	What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?	No, no doctor...	But why?	Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.	But 
Who are they?	The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.	Can I have something to drink?
Does anybody know I'm here?	Only the elders.	How long?	What?	How long have I been here?	Two days.	Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.	But you can't.
Tell him his tea stinks.	You tell him. When you're able.
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.	Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -	It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.  That is not for Samuel.
Enjoying your reading?	Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?	Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.
Your husband's?	Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.	Something wrong with buttons?	Buttons are Hochmut.	Hochmut?	Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.	Anything against zippers?	You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.	Quaint? Can't imagine why.
Where's the nearest telephone?	Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.	No. I'd want a public phone.
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.	I'm going this morning.	But Stoltzfus said...	I know what he said.	You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
The... bullets?	Oh. The bullets.
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.	Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?	We had some lemonade and he left.	A real fireball.
You know carpentry?	I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.	What else can you do?	I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.	Whacking is not of much use on a farm.	Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.	I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.
Sure.	But... You may not be well enough.	I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
When will you be going?	Not long... A few days.
Won him over just like that.	I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.	I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.	There was.	There was a time when I would have welcomed it.	I know.	I was being foolish?	No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.	You're so sure of that?	Aren't you? After today?	I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!	Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.	There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!	Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!	What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!	That's your way, not mine.	That's God's way!	Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
I want you to take this... to remember by.	Where's my baggy pants?	Here. Whenever you want them.
Anybody know about this?	I didn't even know about it.	Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?
I got there late, John.	Let's just find Coalmine.  Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens 	It won't happen again.
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.	What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.	Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.	Johnny, what the fuck?	Listen to me  Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...	I hear you.	Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
It's me.	Johnny! Where the hell have you been?	Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?	Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.	I'm coming.	Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch  I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
You hear me?	I hear you. I'll stay in touch.	That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.	Say again?	Make that 1790.
You know where he is.	Wrong.	You'd lie to protect him.	Probably.
You admit you're lying?	I admit I don't know where he is.	You're the first one he'll contact.	He's got my number.
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...	What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
Did you find him?	Not yet.
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.	He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!	Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.	Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!	Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 	I don't know where he is.	But... if you had to guess?
Everything okay?	Yes, thank you very much.	John said you're Amish.	Yes.	Oh.
Good morning.	You didn't have to...	I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!	Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.	You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?	I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
What's so funny?	Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.	God, Fred...	At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.	No? Why not?	You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.	Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
Who was that man?	His name is John Book.
Is the English dead?	No...	Looks dead...
That has no place in this house.	I know.
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws 	We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!	Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.	I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.	Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?	I have done nothing against the ordnung.	Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?	I have committed no sin.	No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!	That is idle talk.	Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
I am not a child.	You are acting like one!	I will be the judge of that.	No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!	You shame yourself.
No, Rachel...	I have to help him!
Never seen anything like that in all my years.	He's from... Ohio... My cousin.	We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.	John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.	You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?	Yes. Samuel! We're going.
She say where he is?	I don't think she knows.
What about Carter?	Tight. But I'm working on him.	Lean on him.
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?	They don't have any shit.
He's not in this building.	All right, where is he?
No, you listen. Get out!	Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?	You have no right here!
He'll live.	You might have killed him!	Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
Get back in there.	My son is out there!	Nobody's going to hurt your son...
Is this where we're going?	Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
Momma... are they angry with us.	No... No. It is just the English way.
I don't want to stay here.	They are English. They don't understand.	I wish dawdie was with us.	I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Aunt Em!	Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --	Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --	Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--	Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!	Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --	Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!	Oh -- all right.
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --	Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.	No --	Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
Dorothy!	You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --	Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.	Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!	Yes, darling.
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.	There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.	No --
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --	No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.	I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.	Yes.	Oh, I hope we got them in time.	Yes.
Uhh -- yeah --	Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --	Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!	Well, Dorothy was walking along the --	I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!	All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --	Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally	But we've got to verify it legally To see...	To see?	If she...	If she?	Is morally, ethic'ly
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!	If any!	Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
From now on you'll be history	You'll be hist...
Our echo.	Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!	The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
...have you come back?	Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.	Oh ....
...resourceful!	Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.	Not so fast!  Not....
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!	Do you presume to criticize the....
... -- Oz -- has spoken!	Who are you?	Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.	You are?
Uhhhh -- yes...	I don't believe you!	No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!	Oh ....
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!	Ohhh!	Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!	I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!	Oh --	Goodbye, folks!
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.	Well, gee, I try and have a heart.	Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.	This?	Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!	Oh!	Who did it? Now wait a minute.	Hickory!	Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!	Are you all right, Dorothy?	Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
...didn't you?	No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!	All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.	Oh, please give me back my dog!	Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.	But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.	Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.	That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
Ahh!  Ah!	I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?	No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
Run, Toto, run!	Catch him, you fool!
Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?	Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.	Oh!  Well....
Toto's my dog.	Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.	Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?	The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.  It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out.
I thought you said she was dead.	That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.	Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.	No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!	The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?	Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?	No, I'm afraid I didn't.	Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.	But, how do I start for Emerald City?	It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?	You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.	I have?
...Toto, too?	Toto, too.	Oh, now?	Whenever you wish.	Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
Are you ready now?	Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Yes, I'm ready now.	Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
"And think to yourself -- ""There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."""	There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.	How did you guess?	Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?	Why --	No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --	Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
Yes --	Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?	Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.	Oh --	Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.	Aw, come, come, come --	No, they won't - honestly.	Oh --	Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?	Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
That's our farm!	Oh -- yes.
...her face is careworn.	Yes...That's Aunt Em.	Her -- her name is Emily.
That's right.  What's she doing?	Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.	Oh --	Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.	Me?
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.	Uh-huh.	What's she doing now?
...room --	Has it poppies on the wall....
...paper?	I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
...bed.	Oh, no -- no!	That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.	Oh, you....
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!	But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.	Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
Oh --	But you couldn't have been, could you?
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.	Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
Now you're seeing reason.	No --	Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.	Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...	Stop her!
Oil can.....Oil can....	Did you say something?	Oil can....
Where do you want to be oiled first?	My mouth -- my mouth!
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.	Oh...
Oh --	...Oh, did that hurt?	No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---	Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?	Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.	Well, you're perfect now.	My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!	Oh --!
Oh --	All hollow.  Oh --
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?	I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.	Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.	Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?	Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already.	Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
Oh! They're - they're gone now.	Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?	I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.	Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!	Oh - I'll get it!	Oh! Oh!
Oh --	Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!	Oh-oh-
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.	Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
We might.	Oh --
And bears!	What sort of an animal is that?	It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
And him a brain.	I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Can't that female take no for an answer?	Oh --
Oh, he's just ascared again.	Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
No.  Why only --  Oh --	Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
Oh! Something bit me, too!	Now come on - you're acting silly --
Dorothy!	I knew you would!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.	You've had plenty of time already!
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!	Yes...!
...yes.	Look -- it ticks!
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.	Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
Oh, my!	Lions and tigers and bears!	Oh, my!	Lions and tigers and bears!	Oh, my!	Lions and tigers and bears!	Oh, my!	Lions and tigers and bears!	Oh, my!
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.	No, but you tried to.
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --	Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?	Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!	You're right -- I am a coward.
...has been simply unbearable.	Oh.	Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
A home --	The nerve.
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!	Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
Yes -- let's run!	Yes.
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?	Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho	Hah!
Who's her?  Who's her?	It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.	And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
I'll be home in time for supper!	In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?	Not nobody, not nohow!
How about a hippopotamus?	Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!	Supposin' you met an elephant?	I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.	Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.	I'd sooner wait outside.	But why?  Why?	Because I'm still scared!	Oh, come on.	Ohh!
Oh -- Oh, come on.	Huh?  What'd he say?
Does it work?	No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.	Oh --
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.	It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.	Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?	I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!	Did they hurtcha?	Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
They're coming back!	Ohhh!
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!	Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
Oh, now I'll never get home!	Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.	Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.	I think I'll miss you most of all.
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.	I have so got brains.	Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?	Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.	Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!	What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
...don't talk.	It's pleasant down that way, too.
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --	Oh, well, here -- let me help you.	Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
...yes.	Ohhhh --	Ohh!
Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!	Oh -- does it hurt you?	Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.	Ohhh --	My, it's good to be....
...free!	Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!	Did I scare you?	No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!	They would?	Um-hmm.	Where's Kansas?	That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.	You're going to see a Wizard?	Um-hmm.	Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?	I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.	Yes -- that's true.	But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.	Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.	I don't blame you for that.	But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!	Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.	Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.	To Oz?	To Oz!
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.	Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.	Oh --
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!	What?	Yes.  Oh -- look --
Oil can what?	Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
He said his mouth.	Here -- here --	The other side....	Yes --- there.
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.	And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.	Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?	I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!	Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.	Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?	I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
...along.	Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!	Oh --
Yes -- there --	Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.	Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Dear, whatever shall we do?	Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Oh --	Looks like we came a long way for nothing.	Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
Oh -- Oh --	Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Oh, come on now - everybody --	Did you just hear what I just heard?
No -- No -- No -- No!	Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!	Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!	Leave her alone!	You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
...ting the ruby slippers?	The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---	It's too late!  There they....
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!	Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.	Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
Real courage. That's what we want.	You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
Yeah.	Ah --	Dorothy next!	Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.	It did?
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.	Don't you start it, too!
What if it were a brontosaurus?	I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Would...would it do any good if I roared?	Who at?	I don't know.
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.	What's the matter?
What happened?	Somebody pulled my tail.	Oh, you did it yourself!	I -- Oh --	Here --   Come on.	What was that?
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?	Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
I've got a plan how to get in there.	Fine.  He's got a plan	And you're going to lead us.	Yeah. Me?	Yes, you.	I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?	That's right.	All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Up!	Now...
Come on -- I've got another idea.	Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Stop pushing!	Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
Where -- where do we go now?	This way!  Come on!
You humbug!	Yeah!
Sneaking up on me, eh?  Why!	Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!	Oh, scared, huh?
I haven't slept in weeks.	Why don't you try counting sheep?	That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
Dorothy!	Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Not even a rhinoceros?	Imposserous!
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.	She - she can have my Witch Remover.
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away!	Hold still - hold still --
It's a whatzis.	It's a whatzis?	Whozat?	Whozat?
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.	Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.	Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.	Yeah --
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.	I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
No?  Now, wait a minute.	You don't neither --
Where do we go now?	Yeah.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!	Don't push!
You don't get around us that easy!	Not nohow!
Mr. Gale!	Howdy, Miss Gulch.	I want to see you and your wife right away....
... about Dorothy.	Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?	What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!	You mean she bit you?	No, her dog!	Oh, she bit her dog, eh?	NO!
...Tin Man!	Ohhhh -- it's me!
...junk!	Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --	Quiet!	Ohhhhhh!
...of the West.	B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
Beautiful!  What an echo!	It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!	I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
No, sir!	No, sir!
That's right.	We do.	To Oz?	To Oz!
Animals that -- that eat straw?	Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
I'd be gentle as a lizard --	I'd be clever as a gizzard --
Then I'm sure to get a brain --	A heart --
Come on -- come on --	Hurry -- hurry --
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!	Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!	Emerald City!
Hey, Dorothy!	Dorothy!
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!	Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.	I don't think I could, but we could try.	Let's.	Yes.	Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!	Here, Tin Man -- help me.
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!	It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!	It's no use screaming at a time like this! Nobody will hear you!  Help!
Ha -- ha -- ha --	Ho -- ho --ho
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!	I can fairly hear my heart beating!
Oh, did - did you see that?	Oh - look out.	You know something?
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!	I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
It's a whozis.	It's a whozis?
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!	Oh!  Well, what happened to you?	They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!	Well, that's you all over.
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!	Now, now, don't fret.	Oh, dear, dear.	We'll get you together!
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.	But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
...to Dorothy!	Oh --	Come on, fellows!
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out.	Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
No, you don't.	Oh, no!
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?	You put up a great fight, Lion.	Yeah --	I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Oh - upstairs, quickly!	Go on!
Hey -- what about Dorothy?	Yes -- how about Dorothy?
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!	It makes you nervous?	Yes.
What about us?	Well, I --	What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?	Well, I --	-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?	Well, I --
Well --	You promised us real things -- a real...
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.	Th.D.?
How can I ever thank you enough?	Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.	But I still want one.	Yes -- ....
Stop that dog!	This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!	Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
-- Ruined my exit!	Help!
You new?	Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?	Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.	Dont know any doctor jokes.
What happened to Len Tashka?	Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.	The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we werent around, theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
He is an impostor.  Theres no Davidov at Miratom.	Heres your imposter. Hes paid off the men on the plane outside.  Theyre not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, theyre flying it wherever he tells them.
Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing.	So who are you?	Bond --
They wont get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.	With this?
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?	When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.	Alright then, brunch.
The plutonium is missing.  Theyve taken the core!	Then its no longer a bomb?	Its a bomb alright. Were still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!	I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.	What the hell are you talking about?	Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.	Whos she?	Elektra King.	Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.	Makes her look even more innocent.	What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?	I was hoping you could tell me.
What is it?	She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And Ms life is part of the bet.
Nuclear.	Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.	Made to look just like an accident.
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...	Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...	The King pipeline.	Elektra would control it all.
Zukovsky...	If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead.
Is there another way?	We go down to the torpedo bay.
Hes sealed himself in.	Hes going to insert the plutonium.
Do you know what youre doing?	Like riding a bike.
What kind of bikes did you ride?	Just wanted to put him on edge...
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink.	But what if...	Count to twenty.  Ill be there.
Weve got to get out.	We cant.
I love Christmas in Turkey.	So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wont just be two weeks out of action.	I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Its just a scratch.	James.  It wouldnt really be...
Then maybe Id be... open to that.	Perhaps after this ... test?	...yes?...	I could come for a second opinion?
Constructions not exactly my line.	Quite the opposite, in fact.
Old friend?	Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.	Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  Ive known that girl all her life. Im not sure she knows what shes walking into.	Shes not a girl anymore.
Ive scheduled a medical for you.	Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.	Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?	Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.	And now its up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought.
Who told you to look at Elektras files?	I took the initiative.	You havent been given an assignment in this case.	I was the one who brought that money in...	Im well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.	The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
Its a message.  He wants us to know hes back.	Who?	Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...	Renard.
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektras ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.	Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?	How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, Id do the same again.
He survived?	The doctor who saved him couldnt get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, hes a dead man.
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.	That which does not kill me makes me stronger.	Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.	Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.	The worm on the hook again.
The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.	Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.	Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...	The inside man?	Is maybe...the inside woman.
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..	Which is neutral, no doubt.
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.	Who did you get it from?	I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...	And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.	Your last chance. Take the money.	Your last chance. Give me the name.	Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
The name?	I cant tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.	Indeed.
Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it.	Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
Who is it?	You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.	Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?	Consider me ungrateful.	Its I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.	Shell get over it.	You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldnt have done it without you.
In case youve forgotten.  Im dead already.	Havent you heard the news?  So is she.
Beautiful, isnt it?	Yes.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.	Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.	A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.	You knew him well?
He was my father.	Im sorry.	He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
I met you at my fathers funeral.	Yes.	I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.	Funerals arent exactly memorable.	God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Im not sure he knew that.	Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?	Partially, yes.
Who is he?	My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. Hes decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette.	How long has he been with you?	Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
Does this look familiar to you?	Its my fathers pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?	Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.	If youve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I dont need a third...
The killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue, doesnt want to see you take over...	Thats every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  Thats why youre here, isnt it? You think I cant do it. You think Im going to screw up. Or get myself killed.	I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially Kings daughter.	You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.	Always wanted to see the upper lines.	You dont take no for an answer, do you?	No.
Oh my God...were buried alive...	Were alright.
I cant stay here.	Youre not going to.
No!  It will cave in!	Its the only way out...
I cant stay.	I know.
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.	I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.
What is it?	...you should rest.
James...	I have to go.	Then take me with you.	No. Youll be safe here.	I dont want to be safe!	I have to go to work.
Vodka martini.	Two. Shaken not stirred.
What the hell are you doing here?	Someone wants to kill me, Id rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now.	You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill.
I understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.	Really?
Surely you believe in living dangerously.	Not at that price. Time to surrender.
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.	Shush.
How did you survive?	I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  Ive never told anyone that.
Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy?	A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive?  Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto?	What are you talking about?	Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?	...what?	We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
Are you saying...Renard is the man whos trying to kill me?	You can drop the act, its over.	I dont know what youre talking about!	I think you do.
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didnt have to sleep with you to find that out.	He used your exact words.	You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
Im coming with you.	You do what you have to do, but Ive called in M.  Shes en route from London even now.
I could have given you the world.	Not interested.
Wheres M?	Soon shell be everywhere.
All this, because you fell for Renard?	Five more turns and your neck will break.
Since I was a child, Ive always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.	You turned Renard.	Just like you...only you were even easier.
So you killed your father.	He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
Was this all about the oil?	It is my oil!  Mine and my familys!
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. Im going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfathers name, the glory of my people.	No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
Know what happens when a man is strangled?	Elektra, its not too late.  Eight million people neednt die.
One... last... screw?	Oh James.
Valentin Zukovsky.	BondJamesBond. What brings you here?	You, of course. I need some information.	Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...	Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rats nest.	Have some of the rats nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
See?  Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want?	How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?	What?  This is not possible.
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.	Where did you get this?	Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.	How high up does this...arms dealing go?	Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.	But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?	Shes no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.	Ah, I see.  A purely...plutonic relationship.
Really Bond, couldnt you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?	Whats your business with Elektra King?	I thought you were the one in her business.	She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?	As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!	You are out of your league.  Shes working with Renard.
Now...where were we?	A rope!	No.  The truth!  She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for?
Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff.	And the payoff on the tables?	A special job.  A...a...a submarine.
Wheres the sub going?!	No!  Get me out!	This is too big for even you.  Where is it?	This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.	Where?	Istanbul.
Mother of God.	The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
The Maidens Tower.	How appropriate.	Id heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
What?	To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
No! Bond!	Bond!
What is this place?	Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.	What class sub does your nephew run?	C-class.
Ill send someone out.	Could...could you come?
Perhaps this isnt the time...	Please.
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.	Your father...	Is nothing.  His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back.
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.	Someone will come.	Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
Warm.	Is it?
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.	How would you know?
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  Its what you wanted.	Of course...
He was a...good lover?	What do you think?
This is the end.	No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?	Yes.  Au revoir...
Weve been pawns in someones game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.	And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
Do we have the range of Renards plane?	Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...	Marvellous.
The parcels in the post.	Its heading for the oil terminal.	Where it can do the most damage.
Any word from him?	Still no contact yet.
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.	Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.	Why?  What's the problem?	I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.	I would like to use the bathroom --
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.	What?!	Please.
What about our end?	Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
What kind of time frame are we talking about?	Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.	"What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . ""nuclear winter"" theory?"	We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.	The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
Had a lot of blood in him.	You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.	No idea who's behind this?	Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.	Washington?	They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
Walter --	Don't call me that.	Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.	Wrong answers?	There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.	Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
A whore fucking.	Who is she?  Do you know her?
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?	Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?	God isn't there to do it.	We don't know that.
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --	Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
Hi, Jon.	Hello, Adrian.
The bearer of bad news.	We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
"Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is ""stalking"" the Watchmen."	Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.	What's your theory?	Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.	You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?	Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Blake?  Dead?	Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
I'm here, Laurie.	Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?	Not yet, there's plenty of time.
Would you like me to stay?	Mm hmm.	I could stay and go.	. . . And just how would you manage that?
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.	Collect me?	In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .	Jon, no -- I can't --	It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.	Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?	Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.	You -- you know about me and Dan?
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.	Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?	Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.	That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?	Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.	Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.	I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.	But you knew that I'd -- die.	Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.	Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!	Because --	"Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this ""script"" you're following . . . who writes it?"	I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.	Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
Jon, I do not want to hear it.	I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .	Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.	You're the only human being I care for.	Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.	I won't do that.	You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.	I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.	Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
What -- am I --	Cured, yes.
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .	Jon -- what??	The south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.
Jon, where are we?	Veidt¹s complex.
Jon --	Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.	Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?	I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.	My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?	It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.	Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.	You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.	He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.	If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?	No.  I just wanted you to --	You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.	Good night.
Who?	I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?	She's with me.	Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.	Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .	The missing scientists.	Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
What??	I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.	Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?	It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.	What is it?  How does it work?	It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --	Adrian -- you've lost it.	I've seen them!  I've seen them in there.
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?	And what if you¹re wrong?	I¹m not.	What if you¹re wrong??	Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!  I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.	You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?	We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?	Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.	Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .	Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.	Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.	
Damn straight.	Damn straight!  We were heroes.	Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.	Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .	Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .	Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?	That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?	He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?	Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.	You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.	Maybe not, but why take chances?	Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --	No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.	You're sure?
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --	I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
His what?	His . . . whatever.	I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.	I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.	Play one.  Educate yourself.
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?	Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!	I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?	I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .	Old?	Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.	. . . What?	Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.	Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?	The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?	One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
-- What is it.	I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.	Laurie --	I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --	With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?	Memory lane.
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.	-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.	Antarctica??	Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.	Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.	You and me.
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.	Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.	What are you up to?	Don't look.  Turn around.
This'd better not be what I think it is.	Okay!
What the hell -- ?	It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.	Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
They're following us.	All right.  Mission accomplished.
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!	I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.	They're practically on us . . .	That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
What?	The costumes.  Am I right?
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.	Yes you are.	No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.	That's because --	It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?	Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.	. . . What??
What's he doing?	I think he's going to the john.	My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.	Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Welcome back, Night Owl.	What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
What was he doing?	Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
He saved himself.  He changed the past.	Where did he go?
Dan, is this -- is this New York??	Those cars.  What year is this??	Everything's changed --
Dan -- what do we do now?	Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --	We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.	Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.	Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
So do I.  So do you.	Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.	Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
. . . That was quick.	Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.	Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.	What new information?	Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . .
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.	What do you mean, frame-up?	Obvious pattern -- all ties in --	Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .	Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
Where's Laurie?	I don't think she's coming with us.
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.	Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --	Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.	Coward.  Giving up.	SHUT UP, Rorschach.
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.	Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
What happened?	The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.	What caused it?	Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?	He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.	Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.	Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.	With lots of ketchup?
Nothing wrong with ketchup.	Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?	Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --	We should get back --  What?	Nothing.  What were you going to say?	We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --	Janey, will you marry me?
I can fix it.	-- What?	My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?	Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --	No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.	Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.	No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
No comment.	Did you know he was back on the streets?	I did not.  Now get out of my way!	Isn't it true that you --
Their real names, please.	I don't know their real names.	You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.	I don't know their real names!	"You're not ""protecting"" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --"	Then why don't you ask him?!?
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.	What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
I'm terribly sorry.	What does this mean?  What does it --	Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.	That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.	Am I free to go?	You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.	I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --	Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.	Jon??  You mean he's --	That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
Adrian.	Laurie!  Good to see you.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.	And how's life with the walking H-bomb?	He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --	I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.	Please.
He's a little farther gone every time.	Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.	Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.	I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --	What about you?	I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.	Maybe I'll do that.	I'm sorry about Blake.
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.	Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.	You're making a big --
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.	ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --	Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.	CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --	Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.	No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
New information.	Ever see one of these before?	Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.	What is that ungodly smell?
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .	Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.	Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .	Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.	No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.	Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
Who the hell are you?	The name's Gibbons. You were saying?	What is this place?	Looks like a diner.	"Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a ""salesman"" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a ""trucker"", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I ""walked"" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?"
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.	That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?	Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.	Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.	It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.	A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.	"Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. ""Many are called, few are chosen"", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?"	..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.	Why is that?	Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.	Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.	Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.	You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.	Is that a fact?	Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.	You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.	You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.	You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.	Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.	You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.	You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.	I'm not interested. I've already got a job.	You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.	I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.	That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?	There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.	What do I get out of it?	If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.	You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along.
Not bad for a gimp.	"What's with that ""X"" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're ""extreme""? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head."
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?	Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?	Yeah, I spy or I die.
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.	Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
Up yours.	Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
Is that all?	Just remember, I'll be watching.
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.	If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.	Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.	One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!	I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?	We're not after car thieves here.	What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.	That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.	Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?	My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...	I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out.
"You did say ""Ahab""? You're sure about that?"	Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.	"This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this ""Ahab""."	Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?	I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.
Thanks.	You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.	You ain't seen nothing yet.
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.	I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?	"They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that ""classified"" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song ""Silent Night"" mean anything to you?"	Yes it does.	Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.	Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.	Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?	Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.	Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.	Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.	We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill.
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.	I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?	You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.	But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.	Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.	Who says you're the good guys?
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.	Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?	On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?	No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?	All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.	You're a jerk-off, you know that?
What do you have?	"Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called ""Ahab"". Whatever it is, it cost him his life."	He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.	They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.	Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys	We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.	How will you fix it?	I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.	So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.	You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...	The scum of the Earth.	But programmable. And expendable.	I've seen enough. Turn it off.
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.	That's exactly why we need them.
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.	I think we should send him whatever he wants.	You what? A wire transfer of this size?	If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.	You're talking about a very expensive risk here.	He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.	Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.	So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
Whatchu doing here?	Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.	That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?	We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.	You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.	Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.	Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
What game is that?	"Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called ""Anarchy 99"", they're the bad guy bosses."	Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.	You wanna check it out? Come here.
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.	Naturally.
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.	"Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the ""Finger of God"". Assassination and weapons."
"Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it ""blood week"". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99."	"""Anarchy"" 99""?"	What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.	What weapons do you have?
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.	What do you get if you finish?	Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.	Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.	Like what?	He gets to be the hero.
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.	I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet, if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two, max.
Do you know what a wire transfer is?	Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.	My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.	Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.	So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?	Yorgi asked me to.	You do everything Yorgi says?	Go to hell.	It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?	Mind your business.	Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
Where are you going?	Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.	I was invited. What's your story?	I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.	Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.	That right? Why's that?
Who are you?	We hung out last night, remember?	I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?	Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.	You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
Hey, you're good.	Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.	That makes two of us then, sweetheart, because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them, I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me, who's bullshitting who?
I don't know what you're talking about.	The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.	Go to hell!	Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
What are you?	I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.	I'm from L.A.	So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?	Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.	Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.	Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.	You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.	I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.	Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?	The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.	All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.	We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.	A beach named X? That I'd like to see.	So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
They tell me you're an American agent.	What are you talking about?	There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.	It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.	Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.	If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.	That's alright, I'll figure something out.	Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.	They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?	No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.	We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?	There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.	What's that?	I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.	You're what? What the hell have you been doing?	I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.	I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.	Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.	Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.	When can I see you again?	You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember?
Are you alright?	What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!	I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.	I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
What are you doing with the Ivans?	I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
Where are we going?	We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.	Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?	It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.	Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!	What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.	Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.	No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?	We can't leave now. We have to do something.	Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said.
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.	We'll have to go after them.	Aren't you afraid?	A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.	I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.	You don't have to do that.	Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.	Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?	I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.	When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.	What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.	He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
Yorgi and Kirill.	Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
Did you do your homework?	If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.	Let's do this.
Where's he headed?	He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
Where'd the damn truck go?!	Go to the water, it's that way!
Toadies right behind.	Let me.
You okay?	A piece of shrapnel hit me.	I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
He's shut out the communication circuit!	You can't talk to it?	No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.	A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.	It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?	By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!	Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.	You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
What are you doing?	It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
Nothing. He had two days.	Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
What are you doing?	It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
What was that for?	I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.	You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.	Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.	Viktor! Stay the course.
The Peace conference...	Nice place to start, don't you think?
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.	That's would be me.
Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.	I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.	Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.	Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.	Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.	They come in any other styles or colors?
This is your standard dart gun.	That one I'm real familiar with.
I think I'll hang on to these.	Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
From the Beastie Boys collection?	It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.	You're joking, right?
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.	I thought that was in detail.
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...	I'm through, Xander.	I can see that. Why?	You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.	I'm having fun, what's the problem?	"You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much ""integrity"" for that."	I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money...
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?	Alright, so I'll get more.	It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.	Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
What...?	I was gonna wait till the islands, but...	You're serious?	Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?	This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?	I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.	You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.	"You're not exactly ""going anywhere"" yourself."	You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
Sit down.	I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.	Here we go again.	You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.	First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
Nice hops.	The corner. Anarchy 99.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.	Yeah, thanks a lot.
Dude, what are you doing here?	You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.	Is this what you're looking for?
"Sorry, ""dude""."	What's the deal?	Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?	Why you dogging me up?	They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
What's so damn funny?	Been to any good diners lately?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?	A parachute. This does not argue well.
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?	He's a pretty good actor, though.
Help me with this guy.	It's like you said, every man for himself.
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?	Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
That's the guy.	This pizda? Never seen him before.	Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead?
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?	He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.	I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house.
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.	Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.	I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.	When else are you gonna do it?
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?	Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.	It'll work faster if I have an account number.
Very nice. I'm impressed.	I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
I had to inspect the merchandise first.	Of course.
What's this?	This is a gift. From me to you.
What's going on, my friend?	You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?	He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.	Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!	Had to do what I had to do.
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!	"What's ""Anarchy 99""?"	It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.	You wanna see my politics?
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.	That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
"To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: ""America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."""	"""...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese"". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals."	You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.	How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?	Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.	It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.	I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.	You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?	Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.	Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.	My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.	That's alright, I'm kinda tired.	You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
That was for Anders.	Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?	I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.	Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.	You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.	So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.	Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.	Including rape, pillage, murder.	Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.	"And here I thought ""anarchy"" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt."	Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --	Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
What does that mean?	The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.	... until he found tungsten.
I wish I could go.	We all do.	Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--	Beast.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?	I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.	Its core?
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.	For what purpose?	Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.	So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
Scott.. I -	I don't like him being here.	What are you talking about?	You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.	If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
What's wrong with him?	His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.	We have to find Magneto.
Are you all right?	No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.	Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.	I'll tell you one thing though.	What's that?	He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.	Into the Hudson?	Uh-huh.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?	It's too far.	Storm, Rogue, -- you take the south entrance.  Jean and I will go in here.
Jean... can you?	I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?	I wanted to talk to you.
How long have you been in Alaska?	I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?	You know, you --	Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.
I'm o.k.  I'm o.k.	Sure you are, sport.
Anything else I can get you?	Some cigars.  Case of beer.	There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.	I won't light the cigars - how about that?	I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.	What if I like the pain?
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.	Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.	Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.	By reading my thoughts?	If necessary.	What if they're naughty?
You should always work with a spotter.	He's busy right now.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.	Were you now?	What do you say?	Not interested.
Let go.	Suit yourself.
He's uptight.	He takes his work seriously.	He takes himself seriously.	What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
Logan, do you see this ring?	I've seen a lot of rings.	Yeah, I'll bet you have.
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?	I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?	Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --	You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --	Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -	I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.	I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Dr. Grey.	Senator?
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...	Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.	Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.	I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?	Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.	You mutant bastards...
Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.	Gosh, I hope so.
The intention of registration act -	INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
What is it you intend to do to me?	Let's just say, God works too slowly.
I do love a good check mate.	What do you want?	Come with me and I'll let her live.	You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
Where am I?	You're backstage at the encore of creation.
What are you going to do?	In the road to survival, there is always sacrifice Logan.  We are the future... not them.  We must protect ourselves.  After tonight, when the leaders of the world return home -- They will return as brothers, as mutants... and our cause will be theirs.  This is survival, I know you understand that, Logan... or is it Wolverine?
What am I doing here?	I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.	Who?	A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.	Deal.
The point of what?	"This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of ""team"" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?"
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.	What if it never happens?  What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
Now that's Magneto talking.	No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.	I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
Where are we going?	To find Rogue.	How?	The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
You designed this yourself?	Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.	He helped you?	We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
I've found her, Westchester Mall.	I'll go.
Don't you knock?	They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?	Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...	What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
Why is everybody up at sunrise?	The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.	What did she do to me?	She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.	I felt like she almost killed me.	If she held on any longer she could have.	And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
I lost him.	How?	It was Xavier's people.  They knew.
Is that what you're looking for?	A piece.  Only a piece.	Is it enough?	Enough for a test.
I'll find him.	ALIVE.
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.	And I'll never understand terrorists.	I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.	Not at the cost of lives, Max.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?	What do you want with him?
Is that so?	Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.	You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?	Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.	The way what is going to be?	I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.	What do you mean to do?
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.	WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...	I know.
Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?	It does indeed, Max.	And what do you do when you wake up to that?	I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?	Yes, my dear, he is.	And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?	He is the fifth leading authority in his field.	Oh, shit.	Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
Frederick Frankenstein?	You have the wrong house.	And who might you be?	Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.	The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?	No!	What was your grandfather's name?	Victor Frankenstein.
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?	Ugly, vicious rumous.
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?	Poppycock!
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?	Now wait a minute!
Where did you get this cauliflower?	From your office, sir.	Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?	Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.	Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
No, sir.  It will never happen again.	Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
Give him an extra dollar.	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.	He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Carlson!	Yes, sir?	Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.	Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?	... No!
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?	I did, sir.
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.	Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?	Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.	What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?	'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!	Yes, sir.	I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!
What in God's name are you doing?	Baack!	What?	Baack!
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?	MMMmmmm.	All right then... seven's always been my lucky number.
MMMmm!	Is it that music?	MMMMM!  MMMMM!	Probably just some nearby cottage. Nothing to worry about.
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.	MMmmm.
Still happy you married me?	MMmmm.	Love me oodles and oodles?	MMmmm.	So this is what it's like to be completely happy!	MMmmm.
Darling!	Hello...?	Surprised?	Well... yes.	Miss me?	I...
Darling!...you will be careful!?	Of course.	You have your tickets?	Yes.	And your passport?	Yes, don't worry.	Call me from New York before you leave??	Yes.	Promise??	I promise.	Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.	Oh, darling -- so will I.
Will you miss me?	Very....very!	Mother's going to help me with the invitations.	Oh, nice.	I hope you like large weddings.	Whatever makes you happy.	I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.	You're incorrigible!	Does that mean you love me?	You bet your boots it does.
I will!  Goodbye, darling!	Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling.	Goodbye, darling!
Darling!	Darling!
Surprised?	Surprised!	Love me?	Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
Darling!?!	I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Ready, darling?	Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.	Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
What a strange fellow.	Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.	Why does he call you 'master'?
Are you suggesting I call him master???	No, of course not.  I just meant...	All right then!
Poor Delbruck!  There must be some way to reach him -- to control that body.	Darling, you mustn't worry so.
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.	But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.	Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?	You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.	I suppose you're right.	Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?	Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.	Oh, darling!  Don't let's spoil everything.
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.	Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??	That's a tough choice.	Is it worth taking a chance?	I suppose you're right.	Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
Good night.	That's my good boy.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.	It seems fine.	You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.	Does that include the key to the laboratory?
You mean... the laboratory??	Yes!... the laboratory.	No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.	May I have it, please?
There seem to be quite a few books.	Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.	I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?	I don't know what you mean, sir.	well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.	This is the only library I know of.	Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?	I think you must be mistaken, sir.
Well... we'll see.	Will there be anything else?	I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?	I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.	Good.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?	This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.	Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
Dr. Frankenstein?	Fron kon steen!	My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.	But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.	Do you have a hundred thousand of them, sir?
How long will this whole thing take?	A week.  Ten days at most.	I'll have to think it over.  It's not so easy just to pick up and...
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.	Why did you do that?	What?	Break that old man's violin.	I didn't do that.	The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?	Yes, sir.	One week at the most!?	One week -- I'll see to it, sir.	Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.	Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.	Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'	I beg your pardon?	My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.	Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.	No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!	But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?	That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.	Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.	Very good!  Since our lab work today is a demonstration of just that distinction... why don't we proceed?
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?	Dr. Fronkonsteen!	Yes?
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?	A piece of what?	Vermicelli.	Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
But wasn't that the whole basis of your grandfathers work, sir...? the re-animation of component parts?	My father was a sick man.	But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?	You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?	How old are you, young man?	Nineteen, sir.	Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.	But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!	Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.	But, sir...	I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,	But your grandfather's work, sir...	My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! Dead is Dead!  There's only one thing I am interested in... and that is the preservation of LIFE!
Frederick Frankenstein?	Fron kon steen!	Are you putting me on?	No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.	And do you also say Fro dereck?	No, Fred ereck.	Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?	It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.	I see.	You must be Igor.
No, it's pronounced Aye gor.	But they told me it was Ee gor.	Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?	You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.	I'm sure we will.	This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.	How do you do?
Are these your bags?	Yes, just the two.
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.	What hump?
There.	I beg your pardon?	There wolf!  There castle!	Why are you talking like that?	I thought you wanted to.	No.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.	What wockers?	The wockers with the knockers.	Wockers with the knockers???	Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
Home!	Home.
Down!  Get down, you beasts!	I wonder what's got into them?
Aye-gor!	Fro-derick!	What are you doing here?	I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
But what you were doing?	Just putting up some tea.	Did you hear that strange music?	What?	Did you hear that strange music??	What?	Did you hear that strange music?
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?	What?	You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?	Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Did you see anyone else down here?	No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
What is this place?	Must be the music room.
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!	'How I Did It.'  Good title!	Funny it should just be lying out here on the table.  I wonder what kind of dribble this is?
Taking the book along?	Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
What a filthy job!	Could be worse!	How?	Could be raining!
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!	I have a pretty good idea.
Do you have the name I wrote down?	Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.	I want that brain.	Was he any good?	Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
Hmm!	And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.	That's not bad.	Can you imagine that brain in this body?	I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?	He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.	Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?	Why?	It's always been one of my favorite names.	If you like -- just hurry!	Thank you, Master.
You're sure you know what you're doing?	Yes!  It's all written down in the notes.  Tie off the kites and come down!	Yes, master.  Just don't turn on any radios.
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.	All right... elevate me!
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.	Tonight?	Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!	You've got it, master.
Throw the second switch!	This guy means business.
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?	What?	More, do you hear me?	What?	Throw the third switch!	Wait till he sees the bill.
You can't win 'em all.	But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
Cold!  Cold and dead!	You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
Don't try to cheer me up that way.	Well, I don't like to see you mope.
You'll be getting me sad next.	I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
I'm not that sort you know.  I appreciate you feelings, but try to show them some other way.	You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.	Who are you talking to?	To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.	I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.	But you did -- I just heard it.	It wasn't me.
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.	I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.	Don't fall for that one.	But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.	careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.
Original.	Give -- me -- your -- hand!
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.	You can say that again.	Yes.	You're just supposed to repeat what you said.	Why?
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.	I'm not trying to be funny.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.	... I'm glad that's...	No, no!  That whole thing!	... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.	Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.	Yes, Master!	Act casual!
How's it going?	What did you find out?	Someone was playing this in the music room.
Where is he?	How do you know it was a 'he'?	All right -- where is she?	How do you know it was a 'she'?	Bring -- me -- the -- violin!	Can you play it?	Maybe...if you get here on time.
Thanks...for all your help.	That's what we're paid for.
I'm a failure.	Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
What monster?	"What d'ya mean ""What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement."
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.	What???	He's carrying her off now through the woods.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...	That sound good, boss.	... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...	I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?	There's only one way.	I'll bet it's a doozy.
Come on, big fellow!	Is everything ready?	Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?	It's the only way.	Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?	It's alive!
Hello there.	MMMMMmmmmmmm.	How's everything?	MMMmmmmmmmm.	I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?	MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!	Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready?
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?	... It's.
Get the sedative ready!	MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!	Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................	Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!	Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.	Soo -- pah doo -- per.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.	...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!	For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!	Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??
MMMmmmmmm.	Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
What's that tune that you're playing	Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.	How sweet!  Such a quaint little tune.
May I see your violin?	It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?	Oh, just a little.
Nice!  Nice little balance to it.	Ja, ja.
Extremely well.	How nice.
Did you have a pleasant trip?	Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
Did you ever have a roll in the hay?	I'm not sure I...get your drift.
Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.	Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing to be afraid of.
Are you busy?	That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?	Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.	We only arrived a few minutes ago.	I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.	Well...	Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.	Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
Would you like a sandwich?	No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.	Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
Inga!	Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.	Inga, wake up!	What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?	Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?	Yes!  What could it be at this hour?	I don't know.  It just woke me up.
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!	Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.	Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.	All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
Ooh!	What a filthy mess.
Look, Doctor!	Well, this explains the music.	But who was playing it?
Oh, doctor!	Perhaps we'd better leave.
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.	And look at this, Doctor!	'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.	Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...	A god?	Yes!	I know.
Right here?	Raise the platform, hurry!	Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Reputation.  Reputation!	I thought it was wonderful.	I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
It wasn't me.	Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
Oh, Doctor!	I think you've done it, master.	Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
It looks that way.	What do you think we should do?
What are you going to do?	I think I'll...carry him.
Do you think you can sing it?	Me?  Sing?	Yes -- quickly, dear!
I'd be so nervous.	This is not the finals -- just sing!	It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'	Stop -- singing!!!
All right -- give it to him!	Are you serious??	Give him the sedative!	Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
Did you do it?	I think so.	Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
Good night, Doctor.	Good night!
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.	Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
Just passing through the night.	What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.	Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.	I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?	Not fooling around.	I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?	I see what you mean.	There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.	I know Frederick.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.	Of course not.
What?	I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.	Nor to Elizabeth.	No.  Nor to Elizabeth.	We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
And Elizabeth has hers.	Yes, Elizabeth has hers.	But, after all, you have yours.
Yes, I have mine.	And I have mine.
Yes...yes, you have yours.	Why don't we talk inside?	Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
Yes, I know.	It wouldn't be fair to her.	Yes, I know.	You've got to help me to remain faithful.	Yes, I will.	...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?	MMmmm.
MMMMmmmmm!	Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
Are you ready for me?	MMMMmmmmm!	Ready for Fuchsmachen???	MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!	I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
No, not sound.	There must have been someone else down here then.
His what??	His schwanzstucker.	Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.	Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
I'm getting tired.	Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
Look how far we've come.	You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.	I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?	Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
How do you know they're done?	The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
How long is it so far?	Four	Three minutes to go!	Yes.	What d'ya want to do to kill time?	Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?	Absolutely!  May my mother grow two heads if I'm not telling the truth.
	Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
Oh, must be around ten... ten-thirty.	Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Another fifteen seconds to go.	Do Something!  Stall them!
Yes, sir, name, please?	Food!	Do you have a reservation?	Food!!	I'm sorry, sir.  We only seat by reservation.
Drink!	Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
Foooooood!	Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?	GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!	Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
"Will you hear ""Last Post"", Sir?"	"I listened extra careful to your ""Stand To"" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?"	From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t	So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .	Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....	You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?	One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
Why don 't the Zulus attack?	Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
An historical moment, Gentlemen.	"Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of ""The Standard"", My Lord."	1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir	Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.	Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?	They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.	Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right	"If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but ""why?"" is the question my readers will ask. ""why?"""	Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.	So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.	My only fear is that the Zulu will avoid the engagement
What o'clock is it, Mr Noggs?	Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42	Our friend Colonel Dumford will be  should be   at this minute approaching Pulleine. I think we'll eat here. I want to scout that mountain top and be back with an appetite in one hour. .
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?	Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.	They come well recommended do they? DURNFORD
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.	I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?	My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?	I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.	Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?	I'm explaining my reasons.
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?	And the threat of counter invasion no longer exists? 40
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.	But will they make good use of them?
What's that strange name the newspaper chap's called?	"Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from ""The Standard""."	Our runners bare his dispatches, do they not?
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.	Thank you.
Yes?	A large party of Zulus have been sighted in the direction of the King's KraaL Getting up, CHELMSFORD moves over to look at the map on his desk.
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.	Certainly, Sin
Stuart?	Yes.	How quickly can you move your artillery forward?	Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.	Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .	Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.	Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.	Well that's typical of Her Majesty's army. Appoint an engineer to do a soldier's work.
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?	Which one?	Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.	ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55	Keep steady. You're the best shots of the Twenty-Fourth. You bunch of heathens, do it
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?	Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
Your orders, Mr Vereker?	I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river	Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.	I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45	And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?	So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there.
