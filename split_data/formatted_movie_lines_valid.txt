Hello Lydia?	Yeah?  Who is this?
Yes.	Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?	Huh-huh.	Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...	Which ones?	All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
Your name was picked.	Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?	A list.	Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?	Well there....  What's the difference?	Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.	You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.	Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?	<u>No!</u>  <u>I told you</u>! <u>You won a contest</u>!
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.	Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
So how do we do this?	Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
Now what?	Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...	Free?	Yes.  They're free.
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline...	How much?	Well, since you're a member, we could...
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...	Tonight!  How's tonight?
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...	What girl?  I didn't notice.	Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
Oh, Lydia!	Lydia.  Lydia what?	God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.	No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
Please don't hurt me?	"""OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!"
I need a drink.	I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.	Great place huh?
Have I died?	Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...	If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.
Where am I?	My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?	No... thanks... Listen --	My name is Parry.	Hi... Where are my shoes?	They're --  -- What?	Where -- ?	<u>What</u>!?	<u>What</u>?!	Sshhhh!
Do you know what the Little People just told me?	The Little People?	They said you're The One.	I'm the one what?	<u>Oh shut up</u>!!!
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.	I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
... Do you know who I am?	Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.	Take a guess...  <u>Let him guess</u>!!  <u>Tch</u>.
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...	No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.	A quest?	But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.	The Little...	They work for Him.	Him...?	God... I'm the janitor of God.
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?	I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.	Listen... I don't mean to be flippant or to enrage you or anything but... you're an imbecile.  And I'm not The One... I'm not <u>any</u> One...
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...	Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.	I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...	But I can't get it... He's...
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...	Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...	Parry.	Parry... I'm Jack.	I know...
Thanks... You can keep the doll.	Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
I'm not married.	Funny -- you look married.
"""Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee""...."	Parry!
Do you follow her every day?	Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.	What's her name?	I don't know.
Why did you do that?	Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.	Fifty dollars?
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!	No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
That's O.K.	Can I take you to lunch?	No..I have to get back to work. Take care of yourself.
Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!	What are you doing?  Give that back!
But I gave it to you!	Well what am I gonna do with it?	I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.	You really want to help me?
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.	You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.	O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....	All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.	Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.	Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...	I don't need a job. I have a quest.	I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!	Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.	No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?	Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?	I LOVE THIS MAN...YA HEAR ME JADED CITY...  ...I'M DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!!
Will you shut-up!!!	You're a true <u>friend</u>.	I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.	You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.	I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...	That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.	I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!	So what? You going to help me?	WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PARRY the Grail, the voices...                           Jack... There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are knows this isn't true.                             saying... I know who you are...                              I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent                        Jack... man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?...
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!	You're totally gone, aren't you?
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!	WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
SAW WHO!!?	The Red Knight!	The Red...?  You're totally gone, aren't you?
Parry...	Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.	Who?	Well, maybe he wants to stay here.  Do...do you want to stay here?
It's such a great song.	It's a classic.
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.	Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?	Yes. I think that's very fair.
.....What are you doing?	Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.	Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!	NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.  This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!	Who are you talking to Jack?	YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!	Bingo!
Are there any questions?	What?	"Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, ""You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men""...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, ""What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?""...And the King says, ""I need a sip of water to cool my throat""...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, ""How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find""? And the fool answers, ""I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty.""... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool."
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.	Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.	Maybe, when we get the Grail...	Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...	Happily married, probably.	Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...	Is that what your girlfriend does for you?	Sure...
Holdin' my penis...	<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
Will you stand still so I can do this!	I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?	In a bar called Hellfire.	Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?	No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.	What are the other reasons?
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.	No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.	I'm still scared.
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.	I know!
Beautiful night huh?	Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!	It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.	Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...
You a fag too?	"<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>""Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!""</u>"	Fuck you.
OWWW....What are you nuts?!	BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
I advise you to let us go.	You advise us!	You're out numbered son.
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!	<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
Are you all right?	OWW...MAN...
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!	You won't be alone for long.
Parry Parry?	No just Parry.	Oh...like Moses.
"How about the ""Hell Merchants""?"	I don't like horror movies!	"How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's ""The Purple Bread,"" an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles."	I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.	Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...	Got any Ethel Merman?
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.	What a gyp.	Yeah.
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.	It sounds exciting.	Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.	Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
How do you know him?	We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
What do you do - for a living I mean?	Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
Tell me more. I want to know everything.	There isn't any more to tell.	Don't say that.	No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.	Well, it's enough for me.	You don't have to say that.	I never say anything I have to.	I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.	What are we about to do?	Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...	I don't drink coffee...	... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...	I don't drink coffee...	And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
Excuse me...	Listen, I'm not feeling well.	Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.	Listen, you're very nice... b...	So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.	Oh... You mean you don't want to.	Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?	You're married.	No.	Divorced.	No, I...	You have a disease.	Will you stop!...  ... I'm in love with you...
... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.	Shhh...
See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right?	I leave it to you.	My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.	Twinky?	"Yeah, 'cause she's so ""twinky""..."	Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...	That's a wig you wear, isn't it?	A wig?	Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.	Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.	Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
Give 'em the horn, Bob.	Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
Well, id'n that nice.	It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.	I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!	I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
You're not going to play it again.	Well, lemme play the other side then.	No.
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.	You said.	"Well, lemme sing the one I picked an' see what you think...  ""When there's a fire in your heart/Break the glass/Sound the alarm..."""
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?	I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself...  You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?	You're playing the other side.
Cerveza.	Serveza yourself!	Now, now.	No, dammit, I would easy.
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.	Out where?
I'll go out with you, or I'll stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do... if you'll just do one thing. If you'll tell me that you love me.	You can sing the song.	You know what, you are never satisfied.	That's right, hand.
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.	No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
Is it my turn again?	Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...	Will you just do what the hell I tell you...	I did, didn' I, El?	You got another ball comin'.
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...	Yeah, great.  Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.	I'm not.	You just going to sit there?	Yes.	Okay. Hope no one hits on you.	I hope they do.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.	You're the pathetic one, not me.	I'm going on over there...	I'm not some piece a crap.	I know you're not.	You treat me like I was.	I'm sorry.	You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...	Now, hand...
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.	You're goin' a find me dead one time.	Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.	If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.	I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.	Do you love me, Bobby?
I'll be gone two or three weeks.	You'll be gone, period.
You like it?	I love it.	"""You'll be burned out/Or smoked out/An' come back to me, I know..."""
"""Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."""	What the hell is that?
What?	I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!	Shut up! All of you!
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?	No.	I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?	Is what you?	You're depressed that I come along.	Who said I was depressed?	Well, is that a happy face I see?
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.	Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.	I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?	If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.	Bobby, don't talk like that...
Okay, Ray...	Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?	Sure...	It brings out my eyes...	Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.	Okay...
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?	I don't know.
Rayette.	What?	Just finish eating.	Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.	I don't, huh?
Bobby...	I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
Come on.	Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...	No, let's go...
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?	No.	You got any change?
Sure you don't want anything?	Fill it up.
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!	You're lucky no one was hurt.	Seven hundred dollars, down the toilet! I'd like to go back and punch the son of a bitch out! Can you give us a lift?
What's your name?	Palm Apodaca.
How far are you going to?	Washington.	We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.	Where are you going?	Alaska.	Alaska? Are you on vacation?
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.	How do you know it's clean?	I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?	Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.	Who?	Who? People, that's who! Pretty soon there won't be room for anyone. They're selling more crap that people go and buy than you can imagine. Oofh! Crap! I believe everybody should have a big hole where they throw in all this stuff and burn it.
Well...	It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
Hey, mack!	Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.	I didn't get it, did I?	No, but it was very clever... I would of just punched her out.
Can I get you anything else?	No. How much do I owe you?	Five'll do it.
No substitutions.	What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?	No. We have tomatoes.	But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?	Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.	I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.	I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.	I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.	What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?	Would you like to talk to the manager?
I don't make the rules.	Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?	Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.	You want me to hold the chicken.	Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Wasn't it, ladies?	Are you talking to us?
We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?	Am I on TV?	She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.	Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.	Well, you seem very professional...	I always tell everyone the same thing. I got rolled and beat up real bad recently, and since then it's two for one, an' I work strictly in tandem with Betty...
Tea.	Would you tell her Bobby's here?
Oh my goodness... Bobby...	Hi, Tita.
Robert Eroica...	Now don't...	No, I'm not...  I'm not.	That's good.
I just can't look at you.	Don't, then.
You always do this to me.	Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.	Thank you...  Oh no, don't put it on there...
Sorry.	This is a very special, very old CB 275...	Oh.	You know who it once belonged to?	No.	Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.	No kidding.
Robert...	Very nice.	I have to talk seriously with you...	Everybody still up on the Island?	Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.	Who's Van Oost?	Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.	Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?	Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in La Roche... and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck...
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.	Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...	Robert, I have to tell you something...	What?	Daddy's very ill.	Oh, well, what, what's he...	He's had two strokes.
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...	Don't tell me about this...
Yeah... I guess so...	I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?	No...
I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.	I know.
Well...  I better let you...	Wait...
Maybe you better stay, then.	No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...	Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...	Yeah, me, too...	It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...	Tita, I've got to go...	All right...
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.	I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
How long have you been staying here?	A couple of months.
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...	Uhm hmm. Some range.	It's not that bad.	Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.	A week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for Godsakes.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?	No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.	We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
What questions?	Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?	Sometimes.
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?	No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?	Sort of.
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?	No, I don't really think you're a freak.	I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...	What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?	Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...	Uhm hmm.	Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...	You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...	Like what?	Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...	Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...	There's nothing to say, Tita...
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?	I don't know.
Do you want some gingerbread?	What?	With applesauce?	No, thanks...
Look at that.	Why are you being so mean?	I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.	Yeah, well, he's...
I think he's got a terrific personality.	You know, he was formerly a sailor.
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?	Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
Where is she, anyway?	My turn.
It's none of your business!	Where's Catherine?!	I don't know where she is!
I'm talking to you, Tita!	Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
You're leaving?	Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...	You were going without saying goodbye?	I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.	But what about me?	I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
Bye, now.	Bye, Robert.
What have you been doing since then?	What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.	And you no longer play at all?
Hello...	I guess you fell in the water.	Yes, intentionally.	That's dangerous, you know.	Swimming?	Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.	Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.	Why?	What would I do with it? Run amok?
Besides piano and swimming, what else do you do?	Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.	Nothing.	Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.	That's right. Have you anything to suggest?	I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.	Then after that?
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.	Tomorrow, then.	Tomorrow's a full practice day...  But the day after is kind of open.
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.	The day after tomorrow.	If you're free.	Yeah, I'll probably be free.
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...	I gave it a second thought.
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...	I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.	You don't call that music, though.	Of course I do. It's music. You know...
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...	Thank you.	I was really very moved by the way you...
Is that funny?	It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.	Why?	Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.	It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.	I didn't have any.	You had no inner feeling?	None.	Then I must have been supplying it.
Wait...	Well, at least you're accomplished at something...	What?	At being a fake.
Catherine...	No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
You think I'm a fake.	I think it's what you think.	No, it isn't what I think.	Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.	I don't think that's accurate...	Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...	I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?	I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...	Some bath oil?
I don't find your language that charming.	It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.	I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
Serious, that's what's important to you?	Yes, that's what's important to me...
No, don't do that...	Shut up...
No inner feeling.	That's right.	I don't believe vou.
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...	That's what you said?	Something witty and devastating like that.
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl...  How are you?	I'm fine.	Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.	Is he?	Yes.
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?	Yeah, I think I could.
Robert?	What?	I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.	Of course I'd like to.
Where are you going?	I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?	I have to talk to you.	I'll be back later...
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...	No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...	Yes, it is!
No, I can't...	Will you let me talk to you, please?	I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.	Oh. You have to tell me that.	What?! I can't hear you!
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...	Catherine...	Please, I'll see you later this evening.
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...	Just give me a chance, will you?	I'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me. It's not just because of Carl, or my music, but because of you...  I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something... How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it?
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?	Yes.	That'll make you happy.	I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
Four or five years.	No, the last time was three years ago.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?	What?	It's still nearly impossible for me to turn my neck. If I wanted to turn toward Catherine, for instance, I'd first have to twist the whole base of my body around...  ... like this...
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.	Is she?
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.	Thanks, Carl...
Robert, do you mind?	What?	Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
You sure you should be playing, Carl?	What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
I'm not aware of it. Like what?	Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...	That's what I mean...
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?	At game, Carl.
That's three games to none, Carl.	All right, let's have a rematch.	I thought you had to go to the mainland today. Aren't you going to miss the ferry?
Oh, for chrissakes...	Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
Robert, I think you better just...	You're all full of shit!
Come on, get moving, dammit!!	Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?	No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...	I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.	No, it's okay.	Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.	It's all right. I'm fine.
You've been staying in a motel all this time?	For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...	I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.	Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...	Oh, no. You're more than welcome.	Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.	Not at all.
No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.	I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing...  Is there any ketchup around?
What kind of doggy is that?	It's a Borzoi.	Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me...
Oh no, it's been much more than that.	Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.	I don't think that's true.	It is true.	Besides being very rude.
You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...	"Oh, my, ""a summit conference."" I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin."	I don't know where you were, penis envy.	I hope I didn't hear that.	"At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, ""What for?"" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that..."
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...	I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
And what about love?	What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?	No, I wouldn't.	Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.	"I think these cold, ""objective"" discussions are aggressive, Samia..."
But I'd like to say, so that I don't dampen the spirit of your adventure...	You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.	Well, I should hope not...
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!	Jesus, what a rude person...
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...	A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Well...	Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.	That's an old maid's tale.	Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating places on the road.
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.	"Don't call me ""honey,"" mack."	"Don't call me ""mack,"" honey."	I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.	You better hold onto your tongue!	Hold onto this.
Mass production is what does it.	"What do you mean ""mass""... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either."	Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.	Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...	In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...	In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...	Yeah, it could be adorable...	And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...	Steam.	Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a stink! I don't even want to talk about it...
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...	There's some good things on it, though.	Pardon me?	The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.	I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
"The choice of words, ""squashed flat,"" juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten..."	Well, she was.	Perhaps...
Miss Dupea.	Yes.
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.	Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?	If you want to call it that.	Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.	That's exactly what I am doing, again.	Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.	I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.	Oh, for pity's sake...
Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.	Aaron, how you doin'?	Fine.	Look at me.	What?	Why you have an attitude for?	Not now, I'm busy	God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.	Hurry up, you're wastin' my time, what the fuck.
Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is.	So get the fuck outta here.
I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.	Then don't go out with me.	"For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'."	Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.	God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.	Just get the fuck outta here.
Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?	There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.	What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.	Is it true?
I told you, no. I'm not that type.	Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.	Alright.
Who are you?	I'm wit' Carlos.
Do you have a name?	Victor.	What?	Victor.
Wussup?	Wussup.
Yo.	Hi.	Remember me, from the pool?	Um. Yeah! Shorty!
So watcha doin'?	Nothin'.	What are you doin' here?	I, umm, came to see you.	You know somebody around here?	No.  What you do today?	Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?	I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
Whadja wanna see me about?	I just wanted to see you.
So you got a girl?	Of course.	So what's her name?	You know. I got a lot, more than one.	A play-ya.	You got a boyfriend?	Me? No. Don't want none either. Such bastards, man.
So wadda you do with your girls?	Just chill.	That's it?	Nah, we make out and stuff.
So what you think of me?	You look good.	I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?	I buy them flowers.	How you treat them?	Good. I'm faithful to them.
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.	I did.	Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?	I kissed those girls.	No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.	I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.	Oh, 'cause you got it like dat?
Come down!	I can't!
Who gives!	I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
Wussup?	Wussup, Victor.	Yo, can I talk to you for a minute?
Eddie from Compost?	Eddie from Baruch, the one who was sittin' wit' dat little girl;
Why don't you ask Eddie?	Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
Why?	I got punished, man.	Fa what?	I won't let my motha cut my hair.	Wha'?	She fucks it all up!	Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.	I can't man, I'm punished!
They are?	Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!	I'll be right down.
So what girls are over there?	Natasha, Maria, Tina-	These are the pretty girls you told me to come down for?
What are you going that way for?	I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,	Where you goin'?	Pitt.	Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?	C'mon.	Man, if I go down you're goin' down with me.
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.	Eddie from Compost?	No, Baruch.
I gotta go take a piss.	If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?	Which one?	You know, Eddie's cousin.
The one with the phat ass?	No, c'mon, stop playin'. The girl that you kissed when we got there. Where s he live at?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?	She lives near Eddie?	I think she lives down by Pitt.	Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?	I think by Twenty-two.	For real?	What you want with her anyway'
Yo! What you goin' for	'Cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her Moms and if I don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. You want her to die?

Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.	How old is he?	I think he's 18 or 17.	You gonna talk to him?	Um, yeah I think so.

You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.	Positive.	You sure?	Positive.	My friend told me she lived around here.	Your friend must be misinformed.	Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
So what do you want with her anyway?	I'm a good friend of hers.	How do I know you're not lying.	Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.	Probably.  One of the many.	What?	Nothing.

Where you know Amanda from?	Jus' from around the way.	You live around here?	Yeah.	You gotta girLfrLend?
I know how ta get him back if you want.	Nah.
First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even --	Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.	Unbelievable.	I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?	Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.	God I admire you.	By the way: what kind of name is Poon?	Comanche Indian.
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.	You're kidding.	Would you like me to change anything?	So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?	We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.	Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.	You mean her.	What?	Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.	Oh, thanks.
Maybe tonight?	Whaddyamean 'maybe'?	That's what he said.	He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?	I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.	Sonofabitch.	Wonder who his supplier is.	I have no idea.	I wasn't asking.	He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?	I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.	I ought to get some sleep.	Creasy, how old are you?	Nineteen.	You're not taking real good care of yourself.
Hey, what are you doing?	Fletch, this is dumb.	You don't have to run with me, Crease.
Fletch!	What goddamn right do you have to take him?
Hey you're really nuts.	They didn't do anything.	What? What are you talking about?	I busted their window, they didn't do anything.	You're lucky.	Not luck. They don't want me.
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?	You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?	Fletch.	Full name.	Fletch F. Fletch	I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?	I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?	Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.	For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...	It was planted on me, sir.	We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.	I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.	'Your men' might just be involved in all this.	You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.	Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.
You can't keep me here.	Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.	I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore... but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way.	My God, you're serious.	Ask anybody.	Can I ask anybody now?
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.	What'll it be Fletch?
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?	Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?	Not a prayer.	That a boy.
Thanks for coming down to see us.	Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Greetings, everyone.	Thank God, the police.
This one's going to be even more fun.	Go ahead. Make my evening.
What the hell are you doing here?	Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.	Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.	I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.	What, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear you say something about Rio, Alan. You're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars I staked you for the next load, are you?
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.	Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
So where do you know Alan from?	We play tennis at the club.	Really. The California Racquet Club?	Yes.	That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.	Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.	Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?	That's Babar.	Two bs?	One. B-a-b-a-r.	That's two.	But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.	Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?	I don't know. I don't have any.	No children?	No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.	Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.	Your aunt?	Mrs. Smith.	Joan or Margaret Smith.	Right.	Well, which one?	Margaret.	Funny old bird.	Is she ever. I've got some stories....	I'll bet. Shame about Ed.	It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.	Oh, he was dying for years.	Sure, but the end was so sudden.	He was in intensive care for eight weeks.	Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.	Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.	Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...	Just relax....	Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?	Breathe easy...	Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.	There is?	Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?	Just relax.	Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?	I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.	I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?	Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.	I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?	Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.	Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
So what do you figure?	No idea.	No idea at all?	Okay. Some idea.	Like when?	Like tonight.	For sure?	No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?	I think Id rather have drugs.	Fletch...	Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, dont you?
Jesus.	You don't know me.	My pleasure.	I'm serious, Sam.	What, the heat here?	Affirmative.	The two surfer boys?	Affirmative.	Thought so. What for?	For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.	You gonna nail the chief?	I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --	Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.	You don't have a piece of the action?	Noooo. Free snort. That's it.	Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.	Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?	What?	You find the source?	Gum thought Brazil.	Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive.
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?	Nothing. They're still there.	Right. Fine.
Are you all right, Doctor?	Where am I?	You're in the Records Room.	I'm fine.	Can I get you something?	Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.	Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.	Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.	Oh my God!	It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.	Yes, right away.
Here you are, Doctor.	Thank you.
Is there anything particular you're looking for?	My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.	Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.	That's it?	That's it.	This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.	I guess not.	He'll be so relieved.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.	What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?	I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.	I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.	She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.	I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.	It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.	Until she remarries, Fletch.	Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.	I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.	She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...	You should have proved that in a court of law.	My lawyer was a bum.	I agree.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.	You may be right.	Are you serious?	That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.	Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.	This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
Cash. I'm impressed.	Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.	Till then.
Good evening.	I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?	Of course.
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?	Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.	What?
Read this, please.	Wait a second --	Cut the crap and read it.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.	Pretty hefty. Keep reading.	'...with his legal wife, the former Sally Ann Cavanaugh.'
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.	I'd have been long gone.	Ahem.  'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.	The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
And what was that?	How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?	Whoops.
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.	Harry S. Truman?	My parents were great fans of the former President.	Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.	Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.	Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?	Right.	Well, I'm fully covered.	I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.	Yes. Where you from, Harry?	California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?	Come on in.
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....	Velma.
Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?	Check.	Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?	Oh, about ten days ago.
Ten days ago?	That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
Isn't that nice. Since when?	Since he moved to L.A.
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.	What the hell does this have to do with insurance?	Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.	Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his.
Has he?	Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?	Then he has.	Course he has. That's his wife.
He sighs.	And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.	Of course they are.
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.	Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.	Where are you going?	Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around.  Don't go back in there.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?	You sure did.
John Ultramalensky, right?	Right.	God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.	Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --	Not mine, stupid. Yours.	What are you doing here?
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.	No problem.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.	Hi Gummy. Hows the eye?	Its okay. The cops did it.	I know.	They busted me last week.	They bust you every week.	I know. I got bad luck or something.
I'm the Sufi.	Fletch?	Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.	What?	Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum.
Why are they after you?	Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.	What's that?	He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.	I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.	Sure you did.	Fletch, I never sold nothing.	Twenty years.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?	I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.	Rio de Janeiro, maybe?	Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?	That's Brazil.	Yeah. Maybe.	Wait here for me, Gummy.
We can't talk about it here.	Why not?	Because we can't.	Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?	I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.	I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.	I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.	Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?	It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...	Nugent. Ted Nugent.	Alan Stanwyk.	Charmed.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.	Who?	Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.	Come inside.
Here's my proposition, Mr. Nugent.	I'm all ears.	I want you to murder me.
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.	I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.	Why don't you try suicide?	My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.	So why pick me?	You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.	Maybe I'm just on vacation.	Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.	Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?	I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
I'm still here.	I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.	Wouldn't they normally be locked?	Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.	I have the same problem with my help.	I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?	I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.	In this drawer....
A .357.	Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.	So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.	Precisely. Are you a good shot?	What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.	Get me on the first shot, if you can.	I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
Do you have a passport?	Sure, all drifters do.	Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.	Take it where?
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.	Where am I going?	Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.	They serve dinner on the flight?	It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.	You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?	I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.	You sure those doors will be open?	Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.	The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.	That's right.	You sure got the hard part.	What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service.
Will you kill me?	Sure.
Yo!	Can I steal you for a minute?	Only if you promise not to return me.	Deal.	'Magic' today, huh?	Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.	Shoot.	Don't say shoot, okay.
Did you hear something?	Not me.	Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away.
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.	No problem, boss.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'	Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.	'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'	Not our kind of people, you understand.	Spot right here.
Thanks.	You doing a story on this guy?	Maybe.
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'	I wonder if that's his doctor.	Only one way to find out.
Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---	That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while.
Did you say cops?	Yeah.	That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
My hero.	Nothing to it.
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.	You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.	I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.	Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
Cute young thing, too.	I'm sorry?	His bride. Cute as a button.	You've met her?
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?	Cute thing.	Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?	Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
She's cute as a button.	How long have they been married?
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?	No, thank you.	How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.	I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.	Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.	Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?	We used to fly together. I'm... John.	John! You used to fly together!
John who?	John Ultrarelamensky.	Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.	It's Scotch-Rumanian.	That's a strange combination.	So were my parents.	Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.	Please.
Damn, I thought I had that one.	You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?	What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.	Preoccupied with what?	Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
Why do you keep doing this?	I love the outfits.
Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.	I have this effect on lots of women.	I bet you do.	Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?	Alan's in Utah.	I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.	Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?	I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?	If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.	You are a rich woman.	See what I mean?
What's he doing in Utah?	None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
Who is it?	It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.	John Ultramalensky?
Hi.	Hi.	I was hoping you'd say that.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.	Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?	I ordered lunch.	You ordered it here?	Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.	Down boy.
I really should change.	No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.	I mean put clothes on.	Here, take mine.
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?	Yes.
Lunch...	God...
All this goes on Underhill's bill?	I saved his life during the war.	You were in the war?	No. He was. I got him out.
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'	It's amazing.	'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'	Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...	'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'	Just like Alan. It's freaky.	Can I ask you a question?	Depends on the question.	Are you still in love with Alan?	No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.	Why'd you let me in?	Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.	Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?	Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.	Good point.	Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.	What about his parents?	He never sees them and I never met them.	How come?
Thanks for the great time.	What is this?	Long story.
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.	I think you should call me Gail, now.	Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.	Why did you do it?
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!	Yeah.	I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?	Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
Who.	Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
So?	So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.	What are you talking about?	That's what I want to know.
He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.	How do you know about that?	He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.	What does all this mean?	Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?	Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --	Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.	But I've seen the deed.	You saw a forgery.
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...	Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?	I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.	Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.	Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...	I'll take you to a game.	What are you talking about?	I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.	Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?	Act natural.	I was afraid you'd say that.	If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
What's wrong, Gail?	I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.	No.	But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'	I think you better sit down.	Oh God, I hate things that start like that....	Gail, please.
What is this....	I checked. There was no divorce.	Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???	I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.	Bastard.	I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.	I'm calling the police. Right now.	You can't do that.	Don't tell me I can't --	They're trying to kill me!
I'm terrified.	Come here.
Don't worry, I can take it.	You shouldn't be here.	I want to hear this.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'	Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?	Yes, I'm with the Underhills.	They just left, sir.	They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.	Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.	Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.	Very good sir.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?	In her cabana, sir.	Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?	Cabana one.	One.	Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?	I would, actually.	Charged to the Underhills, sir?	Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?	Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.	I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?	I recommend it.	Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.	Very good, sir.
You want I set up?	No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.	Muchas gracias.	Sierra del fuego.
Your call is come through.	Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.	What?
The door was unlocked.	Lock's busted.	No wonder.	I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.	I commend him on his choice.	What?	I commend him on his choice
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.	Who are you?	Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.
Where is she?	Moved out.	She moved out?
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.	She moved out.	So you're saying she moved out.	This morning.	This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over.
What did you want under the bed?	Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.	I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.	I'm her cousin.	Tell the cops.	Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
Fletch.	Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?	No, I want an answer, Is the story done?	Uh, almost.	'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.	And a damn fine one, I might add.
Two...	Irwin...	Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.	Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!	I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?	No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?	I never read the paper.	...never reads the paper...
What's the spread on the game tonight?	I don't know.  Look!	Looks great.
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.	Why not? Oh shit... really?
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.	You broke it? You know the source?	Practically.
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....	I have pictures of him. Dealing...	So let's go! We run the pictures.	He's not the story! There's a source behind him.	Who?	Well, there we're in a gray area.	How gray?	I'd say charcoal.	I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?	Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
Gummy and two cops...	Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.	You're onto something. That's good. What?	I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
Just give me a hint, all right?	All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.	Utah?	Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.	What about finding the source?	I have some ideas.	Who? Donnie and Marie?	Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.	Go to transportation, get a ticket.
How could you call him?	It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.	It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.	Get out of here.	He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.	You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.	You'll have it.	But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.	Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.	I want something I can print!	Print this Frank.
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.	What?  Who the hell are they?	This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy.	What...	Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.	Fletch, I got nervous. Please....	Forget it.
Fletch, you want an apology?	You were going to can me, right?	Not really.	Not really?	I was upset.	I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.	Fletch.
Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?	Jim Swarthout?	Yeah.
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?	Frieda's boss.	Who's Frieda?	My secretary.
Yes?	Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.	John!
You don't know the Underhills?	I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.	I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?	Of course.
Mrs. Stanwyk!	In a minute!
But I ain't got you...	But I ain't got you...	No, I ain't got you...	No, I ain't got you...	I said, I ain't got you...	I said, I ain't got you...	I ain't -- got -- you.
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...	Don't say it.  Orange juice?	Please.
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.	Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?	I don't know, I never met your father.
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!	Who's your decorator?	Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.	Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?	Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.	I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
Now that we've broken the ice...	I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...	Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.	But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
No thanks.  I carry my own.	Excuse me?	Let's see, you're her worried sister.  Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.	Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.	Actually, you may take it all now.	Oh... I have some questions.	I have no answers.  Thanks for the stain.  Find the girl.  In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler.  We'll chat again, then.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...	Who?	Nuthin'.
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.	Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...	Uh, let's go sit down.
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.	I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.	So you...	Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.	Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.	They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.	I'll do my best.	Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now.
Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.	Thanks for the information. Appreciate it.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.	I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.	Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?	Have what?	Did she tell you anything?	Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...	Drink your cappucino, you're giving me a headache...
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...	But I am...
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!	We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.	Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
That was close...	What did these Vancouver factories do?
Art Mo-o-o-ney!	Thanks, I needed that.
So many assholes, so few bullets.	Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.	I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.	Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?	I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left. You'd find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.	Great pipes.
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.	Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.	I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?	Right away!
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.	Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Thanks for the promotion, man.	No prob...
Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.	Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.	All your friends call you Jazz.	Exactly.
You wish.	Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
I do it for love.	'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...	Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?	Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.	Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.	You're saying you need money.	Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!	Quit crying.  I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.	I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...	Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
So what about this watch?	Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...	I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.	Spooky.  I'll process her.	Cool.  Jazz, meet me at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion tonight. I'll have a ticket for you at the door.  Some concert.  Could be interesting.  Dress nice.
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?	You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?	This Colleen Sutton woman I'm with. If she flees me to go powder her whatever, I need you to keep tabs...
You going to be okay?	Go on, 'they're stahting.'
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.	Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.	Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
How'd you get this from her?	You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...	A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?	No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.	I wish I knew.  You did good work...	Make eye contact when you say that.	I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...	Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?	Contacts.	I like.
I don't know, what was the case?	Ms. Sutton hired you to find the girl.  Period.	Then I guess her case is closed. Mine isn't.  I want to know why everybody wants Zuzu.  Why people are killing and dying for her.
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...	Yeah, let's bury her.	Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.
You okay?	Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.	Who?
Ah, an obvious choice.	Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
Hello, Ford...	What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
I came to warn you...	Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'	I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
Aha, just what I suspected!	You're not funny.
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?	Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
Your timing swallows the massive one. Grendel just tried to kill us, he's about to frame and kiss Don, and we can't do shit.  Don't even ask about those discs. Goddamn that Art Mooney with a star by his name!  It's tied to Johnny's C.D., I know.	Johnny's C.D.?
What an interface!	Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.	Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?	C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.	Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.	But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...	I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.	Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.	Wha --
Got those Vomit invites here...	Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.	Thanks.  You interested.  It's festival seating, so...	How much?	Three hundred.	You gave it to the girls for one.	Hey, they blew me.	Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?	I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
A simple 'please' would suffice...	Fluck you!
It's red, Ford.	What?
Hello?	Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
You okay?	Peachy.
Let's get serious...	Why are all these people after me?	Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?	I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?	I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!	What?  Jesus, tell me!	It's Spunk Lewis, the lead singer for Dead Ribbit!  Mr. Bus Driver, stop!
Spunk, come back...	How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.	Because I know rock-n-roll.	You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...	Come again?  B.FL.D., I have sex with rock stars; it's not like I'm doing something that I don't enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. Don't worry about me, I practice safe sex and next summer, I'm going to U.C.L.A.
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?	No.  Who's Art Mooney?	He's the lamest clue I've ever had in my life.  Here's our stop...
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...	Friends?  You didn't tell me that.	You didn't ask.  Have you ever thought about mousse?
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...	Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...	What a perv...
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'	People still watch that?	Who cares about people?
Zuzu, wake up...	Hah fluck, great video, huh?	Are you okay?	Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
My axe!	Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.	Ye-ah.  Sure.
This is boring, guys.	Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
Ford, you were right!	Ye-ah.
I'm afraid so, you want her?	But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Nice left you got there, jerk.	Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
This way...	No, wait...
Suck a dick, I left my purse...	As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'	Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?	Ye-ah.
Pretty smooth, huh?	"Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see ""Batman,"" you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny."	Why have you come to my planet?
Ick.	I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.	Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
I can't kill this kid's father...	Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!	This is fucking unbelievable.  Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...
Hello, Mr. Tongue!  What a perv.	You wish.  Come on, let's get outta here.
Are you okay?	There's that question...
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.	ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...	I'll mail you a letter, come on!
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!	Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?	Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?	Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
Gut feeling.	I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!  Get that stick out of your mouth.  These things are killers, man.  Don't you go to school, listen to Smokey the Bear and all that...
When you going to let me work with you?  Why you always fucking with me?	Why am I what?  Excuse me?  I catch you saying the F-word again.  I'll kill you.  That's a fucking promise.  Now get the fuck out of here.
I got something serious to dis-cuss.	Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.	Forget it.
Ouch.	Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.	Who cares?  I got a case.	Twelve pack?
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.	Did he just say what I think he said?	I've got a clue.  Look at my ring. Before my old lady ran off to Baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.	You need it.	I don't need it that bad.
I'm sorry...	Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?	These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.	Run to the nearest phone and call the police.	Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...	Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
I tried to help you...!	And hey, I appreciate it...	Where's my father?  Have you even looked?	Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...	Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
So, did you find my dad?	Well, I got some good news and some bad news.	Yeah, go on...	Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
It's me.	What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?	Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.	Who's my real father, man?	He, he, lives in South America... he's doing that anthropologist- archeologist-dentist kind of thing ... he's real busy.
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?	Shut the heck up... Pop.
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.	You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...	You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...	Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
What are you running from?	Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...	If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.	Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.	Two words.  Disco Express.	Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...	'Booty Time.'	Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...	Like me.	I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.	'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'	You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.	That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.	God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.	Really?
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.	Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.	That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
Polo.	Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.	I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'	Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.	Fine!	What's fine?	I'm off it!	Off what?  Twenty seconds...	The case!	Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.	<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!	Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.	Say cheese...
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.	<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.	Okay.  'B-y-e!
How's it going?	You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!	The point?	Let me go out like a man.	Anyway you want it, asshole.
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.	Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.	Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.	Why thank you.  It's a Christmas present.  That was my sense of humor, everyone.  I wish you would fake a laugh.  It's easy with a deaf person.
I knew your father.  He was quite...	An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.	I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
Well, hello, Ford.	Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.	I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?	Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?	Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
Jazz, we're talking here.	Go on, another time, another place.
Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?	Shock.	And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?	Golly, I'd probably faint.
Actually you're a bit off in the motivation department... I mean, revenge is so... Bronson.  Wait, where's the third C.D.?  How could you come here without proof? It's a three piece set here!  A computer disc from Colleen, Bobby's computer disc, and Johnny's computer disc.  Together they make, oh fucking forget it!	Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.	Don't play games... ugh.  Did you say you don't have the third... ugh.  I'm not going to torture <u>you</u>, Ford.
It doesn't have to be like this?	Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...	It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.	Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?	I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.	What about Don?	Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Kill them.  Not quickly.	Are you okay?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.	Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Shit.	Ciao.
You'd said something about proof...	Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...	Fuck me...	Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...	When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.	Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...	What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.	Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
I'm still the king!	Julian, you're fired.
You're that guy, the private eye.	You're a poet and didn't know it.	Do you really know everybody in the industry?	Only on a first name basis.	That's cute.  You're funny.	That's funny, you're cute.	You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?	I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
Hi, private eye guy!	Hey, the poet...
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.	Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
This isn't music!	It is to us!  It's computerised.
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.	Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.	Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.	I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.	Friendship's a lot different out here.  A wrong number is a relationship.  But then this isn't a social call.
How nice.	It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --	'Bye, Johnny...	What?
So...	I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.	Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money.
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.	Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.	I hope you solve the case and I know you will, because you're the best.  Ford, guys like you don't grow on trees.
What's my name?	Doyle.	What?	Mr. Doyle.	Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?	What?
What about you?  Can you stand a toss?	I'm clean.	You don't use shit?	No.
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?	No - no.	Cause if I do.
How's everything?	Everything is everything.	How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.	There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.	I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.	Boca?	B.O.C.A.	Doesn't register.	Got a wife named Angie.	No, nothing.  There's only some talk.	What?	Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.	Who brings it?
Who knows?	Where do you want it?	This side.
Where are you?	Takin' care o' business, honey.	Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.	You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
-- Well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.	Where'm I goinna get a pizza this time o' night?	Well try, okay?	I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.	Sal --	Yeah?	Don't forget anchovies.
What's your name, asshole?	Fuck you, Santa Claus!
I don't...	Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?	What?	Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?	I don't know what you're talkin' about.	Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?	No... yeah...	Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?	Man, I'm clean.	You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
Henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.	Enchanté.  Alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.
Did you pick up the car?	It is waiting for you in the garage.	Did they follow you?	I wasn't looking.	Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...	My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.	Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice.
Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.	Goodbye.
Allo... Salvatore...	Who's this --	... Salvatore?...
Twelve o'clock... yes...	Yes --
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.	You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.	Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.	Are you having trouble raising the half million?	Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
It has to be by the end of this week.	Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.	It's your problem.	It's yours too!
Tu sais j'ai réfléchi longuement à ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-même.  Tiens.	Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?	Si tu veux.
Oh Alain!  C'est merveilleux!  Tu me gâtes.  Je t'aime.  Attends, je vais te montrer moi aussi ce que j'ai acheté.	Encore du sho ping!
Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.	Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.	Mais non, c'est pour toi.	Pour moi?	Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!	Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis passé voir Françoise.	Comment va-t-elle?	Je n'ai jamais vu tant de sérenité. Elle m'a demandé de tes nouvelles et si nous étions heureux.
Le sommes nous?	Non!
Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.	Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
Are you sure it is dead?	I'm going to put them on the cat.	That's a relief.
Sale boulot.	Il fallait le faire.	Il est en retard.	Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.	Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.	J'ai pas confiance en lui.	Sois gentil avec lui.  On ne sait jamais.  Il peut te faire travailler à la télévision.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.	What happens to the schedule?	We must follow it.	But will they?
I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.	He is not wrong.	Mmmmm.  That bastard who followed me on the subway, he's the eager one.
There'll be someone else.	What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
It's beautiful.	It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.	Who financed it?
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.	Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.	Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.	Mmm.
What's your story?	Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
You're in show business.	S'right.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.	What?	Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.	You're for real?
I got no music!	Fake it.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.	He got off on six.	We have four rooms and six suites on six.  There's a man in almost every one of them.
There's nobody like that on six.	Perhaps he's visiting a guest.	No, I figure he stays here.  Where's your registration?
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.	Names.
A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.	Where from?	Des Moines.	What's he do?	Businessman.  Owns a department store in Des Moines, I think.
Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping.	Yeh?  Who else?	And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I don't know what he does.	This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?	I think so.  But they're in Room 408.  On the fourth floor.
Where's he from?	Marseilles.	
That's in France.	Yeah, I know.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?	Willie Mays.
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?	I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.	They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.	You want some eggs.	Why not?	Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?	Yeah!	Where the hell is it?	Where the hell do you think it is, potato head?
"I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, ""Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."""	Strike out, eh?	Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.	A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.	When ya go back on?	Morning.  Sometime.	Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.  A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.
Christ you should o' collared him right there.	Who's on him?
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.	Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.	Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.	Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.	The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.	Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.	Nothing in there except a New York street map.	Tumble it.  One end to the other.
Who stuck up the laundromat?	How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.	How'd I know he had a knife.	Never trust a nigger.	He coulda been white.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?	Not a chance.
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.	Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say?	Drink this.	Whip it out.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.	Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
Who is that guy?	Policy man in Queens.	What about the last of the big-time spenders.  You make him?
No, you?	Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.	He probably sells insurance.  Owns a chicken farm in Hackensack.
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?	Give who a tail?	The greaser with the blonde.	What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?	Come on -- just for fun --
Monica?  Who's Monica?	A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.	Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.	Toy wit' this will ya.	There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.	Suspicion of what?	Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.	He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.	I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.	Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.	We're goin' now!  Goodbye.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.	This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
Popeye.	Yeah.	It's Cloudy.  Open the door.	I can't.
Why not?	Let yourself in.
What happened to you?	The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
You got the warrant?	We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?	Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
You want the red or the white?	Pour it in your ear.
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.	The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
What about Sal?	We put him to bed for the night.
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.	I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.	This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
Timezit?	Four.
Same car.	Third time around.
Hey, Bo.	Hiya, Jesus.	Can you use a new suit for Christmans?	Whatta you got?
Where'd you get this fag shit?	This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.	Pass.	Forty dollars -- was $250.	Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and burned.
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.	Just for mistakes of parking?
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.	Darling, may I have this one?
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.	Why is it called Hellgate?	The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast.  Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.	What is that old building?	Oh, it's been abandoned for years.	What was it?	It was a crematorium.	For garbage?	For dead bodies.
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.	Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.	I been damn careful up to now.	Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.	I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.	He could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash.  He wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business.
That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.	You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?	Yeah.	You remember Mary Finelli?	What are you saying?	You know what I'm saying.	No, I don't.	Well, I think you do.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.	What I know is what I told you.	Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?	So what?	So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?	Nothing.
Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me!	Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?	Yeah.	I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?	That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.	They around?	Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.	Where's the collar, in the cells?	No, I think he's up in interrogation.	I'll go find Hayes.
Why haven't they killed the juice?	Switches are shorted out.	You're shitting me!	Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.	We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.	We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
How do we get to the vault door?	There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.	Baltimore?	The game, Graham.  The Series?
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.	Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.	I seem nervous, huh?
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...	Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.	I should'a been a fucking mailman.
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?	I'm alright, Gibby.
It looks open on the other side.	Don't know what's behind it.	One way to find out.
Gotta be another way up, Frank.	Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
You okay, man?	Elvis has left the building.
Hey, bud.	Hey, bud.
How about a little of the King?	Well, why not a little of the King?
Damn.	You alright?	I think I ruined the sauce...again.
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?	You didn't marry Donna Reed.	I'd go with you and Chinese take-out over her any time.
How was your tour?	The usual.
Butch called.	Did he?	He did.	It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.	Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.	Sure.
Frank...what's wrong?	Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
Where's Johnny?	I tucked him in at Gordo's.	You give him his drops?	One in each ear.  What would you do without me?	Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
I love you, Bud.	I love you more.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.	He ain't the only one.
I'm off.	Wish you weren't.	Do you know how much I love you?
There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.	Okay...	I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...	Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.	I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.	I know.  He loves that thing.	No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.	I'm serious.	So am I.
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.	The future guy?	Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy...
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!	I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
Hey, bud.	Frank...
Lucky throw, fire boy.	Luck, my ass.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.	Hello, Frank.
Frank, we need to talk...	John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.	I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?	I think you know, Frank.	No, I don't.	Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.	About what?	Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
What do you mean?	Do you know where I found this?
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.	No.  This isn't what you think.	I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.	Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.	You can talk to Julia.  Forget the radio.
I swear, Satch.	Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?	As nuts as that sounds, yes.	Uh, huh.	Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone?
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.	He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...	Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?	How's that?	What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.	Frank, please...	The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.	Frank, this is insane...	In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.	Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
Deleon.	Satch, you gotta listen to me...	Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.	No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.	Next time lets put some money on it.	Get him home safe.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.	I know.  Sorry, Dad.	Glad to hear that.
Okay, start pedaling.	Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.	Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.	Daddy, I'm scared.	C'mon, Chief, show some guts.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.	I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
I'm scared.	Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.	Daddy, Daddy, I can't.	No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
You ready?	Wait...	I'm right here behind you...
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!	I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
Uh, hello?	WB2YKXB, who've I got?	Name's John.
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?	Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.	Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.	Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
Where are you transmitting from?	Queens, New York.	Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.	I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.	15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.	I can't believe people are still using these things.
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?	I don't really follow baseball anymore.	What?	I got fed up with all the bullshit.	Fed up?  Lemme tell you something, in a 1000 years, when school kids study America, they're gonna learn about three things: the Constitution, Rock 'n' Roll, and Baseball.
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?	Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.	Hello?	I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?	Huh?	The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.	Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.	What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.	This afternoon?
Sorry 'bout that.	What'd you just say?	Oh, that was my kid.
You call your son Little Chief?	Uh huh...	What'd you say your name was?	Frank...Frank Sullivan.	Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?	Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...	You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?	Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.	Gordo, if this is you, so help me...	What the hell does Gordy have to do with it?
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?	W...B...2...YXB.
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...	What?	29-years ago.
29 years...?	My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
What the hell...	I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.	I'm not dreaming.
What's going on?	Nothing...I just spilled something.
Oh my god.	What?	You just burned the desk.	What's happening?
That's impossible.	What if it's not...
Dad...?	Johnny...?
How could this be happening?	I don't know.	We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.	Sun spot?	Yeah, that's how Hams work.	Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
You sound...ground up...?	I'm thirty-five years old.	Thirty-five?  That would make it...	1998.
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?	"I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I""m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998."
It's really you, isn't it?	Yeah...I think so.
No, not yet.	Too busy playin' ball, huh?	Nah, I gave it up.
You're still my Little Chief, right?	I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
What's that?	I think I'm losing you.	No wait, don't go!	It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.	But you're not...you're not still here.
What are you talking about?	I lost you.	What?	I never knew you, Dad.	Why?	Fire.	On the job?	It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.	That can't be...that's not gonna happen.	It did, Pop.  It did.	When?	October 12, 1969.
But that's tomorrow.	Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...	I don't understand.
Dad...?	Chief?!  Is that you?	Yeah, it's me.	You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.
Dad, you there?  You okay?	Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.	Tell me.	It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.	I'm glad.
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.	What, Johnny?  What is it?	What it was like when you died in the fire...
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.	Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...	"Are you alright""?"	Something happened, something...	What?  Johnny, what's wrong?	It's Mom.	What?  What is it?	She's not here.	Whatta you mean she's not here?	She...she died.  It's like it just happened.	She just died, your mother just died?	No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
When?	October 22, 1969.	Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now.  How?
Murdered?  Why?	There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.	What kinda twisted animal.	Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.	Whatta you mean...	He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.	What are you talking about?	Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.	I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.	I don't know...  What about the other women?	I'll warn them.	That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.	What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.	No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.	So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?	They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.	I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.	I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.	What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?	Then you get Mom the hell out.  But Dad, those other women weren't supposed to die.  We don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives.
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?	They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
What do I tell them?	Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
I'll be damned.	Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?	No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.	It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.	Whatta we do now?	Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
Got it.	Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.	How?	Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...	All right, I'm with you.  I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.	Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?	Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.	What are we like in...1998?	We're okay...we're good, Dad.	Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?	You really wanna know?	Yeah, you betcha.	Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.	Wow.
Hang on a sec, John.	You there?
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.	H-hi.
John, you still there?	I'm right here, Dad.	You all right?	Yeah, I think so...	Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.	It's not your fault, Dad.	Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.	No.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...	I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.	I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.	But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?	Johnny, I know, but...
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.	John, he's got my driver's license.	What?	He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.	He took your wallet?	No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.	He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?	In my pocket.	We got him!  Dad you got him!	What?	His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.	How the hell am I gonna do that?	Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.	What...	Please, Dad, just do it.	Okay, okay...
I got it.	Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.	Huh?
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.	Hang on.
You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one?	Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?	Dad, you there?
Dad, what the hell is going on?	Just a minute, John...okay?  Don't go away.
John, you there?	Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?	Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder.  John...
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.	We did it, John.  We stopped him.
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...	What's wrong?	I don't remember.  Why don't I remember?
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?	Sully!  Is that you?
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.	What the hell is that smell?
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?	I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
Sull!  What the hell!	I talked to him Gordo.  I talked to my Dad.
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.	No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.	Go in where?	The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.	I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
How you feeling?	Better.
John.  John, you all right?	Longbranch...?	What?
My father didn't die in a fire?	Huh?	My father didn't die in a fire?	Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.	Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?	Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
Huh?	The Ham radio.  That's how come he didn't die in the fire.
This is the Space Cowboy.  I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth.	Gordo?	How'd you know my name, mister?
I better give you my address then.	Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.	You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.	She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.	Nothing you're willing to do.
You're not looking too good.	Whoa, I just...I just...
Maybe you outta lay off a little...	Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
Another rough night, huh?  That it?	Yeah.  That's it.
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...	I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...	And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys.  I don't need 'em.  What I need is a partner I can count on.  I care about you.  Not cause of me and your old man.  Not cause of your mom. But because of you.
She makes ten.	Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.	What're you talking'?  You know better than anybody, John.  You've read this file a thousand times.
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.	That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.	April 16...?  That means she was the first.	Which means he probably knew her.	This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
Okay, lemme walk you through it.	Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.	So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?	Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.	Uh, huh.	What?	I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Got a minute?	Yeah.  Sure.
He ain't our guy, John.	Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.	Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.	Sounds good.	I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.	Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...	So how are things at the hospital?	Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?	No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!	Close.
So how'd you like LION KING?	Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.	I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.	You work too hard, John.	Look who's talking.
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?	Yeah, that's right.
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  Right after he retires from the majors.  We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.	Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.	You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.	She's pretty special.	Are you a good cop, John?	I try to be.	Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?	Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.	I'm sorry.  I didn't realize...  But she knew, John.  A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
"Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say ""hello."""	Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
Wife around?	No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.	Oh.  Sorry.  How so?
You used to be on the job?	Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?	I look familiar?	No.  What house you work?
The 2-3.  Homicide.	A hot shot, huh?	Nah, just working the job.	I hear that.	As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders.
No kiddin'?	No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
Huh.	Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
Who are you?	I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
Hell-	You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
Who the fuck is this?	Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.	Sullivan?	You have the right to speak to an att --	Fuck you, asshole.	It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.	Where are you going?	Going?  How do you mean?	I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?	Drop me off?  How do you mean?
What is that?	"I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe ""he"" wanted me to have this..."	That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!	"""He"" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!"
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!	I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.	Same thing.
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.	Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
No more... I can't!	Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
Who brought up this bright idea?	We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?	According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.	I did?!  I broke the world's record.
You're all just jealous.	Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
What're you gonna do?	Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?	Cool it, Andy.	I didn't mean it the way it sounded...
Breakfast?	No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
What was that?	Where's Shelly?
Why don't we go take a swim?	I don't know...	We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.	Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
What're you doing?	We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.	Not now.  I'm cold.
How about a roll in the hay?	You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?	If you insist.
How do we do it?	First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...	I know how to do it.  I mean, how do we do it in the hammock?
Think you can figure it out?	I'll think of something.
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?	I vote for me.	I vote for the hammock.
What're you doin'?	"I think it's called ""a shower"". You might try it sometime."	You're too clean for me.
Hey Deb... can you hear me?	Barely.	I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?	What?
Do you want a beer or not?	Sure.
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!	Yes, man!
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!	Chuck... look.
I'm a slow eater.	I love you, man!
It's dark down there.	That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.	And Hell is hot, but I ain't goin' down there either.
Maybe we should do some exercise.	This is all the exercise I need...
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?	I can't even remember what day it is, man.	It's Friday the 13th.
What's the matter?!	Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.	Don't do that to me!
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.	Will you come with me?	Be a man, man.
Which one is it?	It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.	Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
What are they saying?	I don't know.  I flunked Spanish.
Come on down!	You go ahead...
What's this?	Your bed.	A hammock?	Have you ever made love in a hammock?
Derek... stop.	Why?
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.	I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?	"You can say... ""Hello, how are you?""... for starters."	Hello.  How are you?
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.	Is that so bad?	I don't know.	You're irresistible.  I lose control.	Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.	Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?	What?	Nothing.
Look what I found.  Remember these?	Did you stay here last night?	No.  I got here just before you did.	Somebody was in here.	Goldilocks and the Three Bears?	I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
Shelly!  Where are you?!	Are you all right, Shelly?
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.	No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
This is too painful to look at.	Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
You know, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else.  The nights are always so peaceful and quiet.	It's deceiving.	What do you mean?	The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
Why did you come back here?	... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.	And, what about us?	I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?	I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?	I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
What happened that night?	You promised you'd never ask me.	After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year.  No one would tell me anything.  All I know is what the police told me.  We have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  What happened?
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...	It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
Could we move a little faster?	Sure, just watch where you're going.
You know him?	Sort of.
Hi.	You're Shelly?	I'm sorry.
What d'ya got in there?	My whole world.	In that little thing?	Stick around and you'll see.
What are we gonna do?	Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Faster!  Eat faster!	Why don't you help us?	Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.	Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?	Not us!  He's really creepy.
Is... is everything all right?	Everything's gonna be fine.	Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...
Please... be cool.	May be please have the wallet.
Are they following us?	Yes.	Gulp!
See anything?	"Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that ""next time"" isn't too soon."	Stop worrying.  I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
I don't see anything.	Keep looking.
Got any good ideas?	Maybe.
This is no time to celebrate!	Just keep your eyes on the road.
What're you doing?	"No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell ""stop,"" you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?"	You're the boss.
Bullseye!	Stop the car!  Now!!
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.	Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.	It was nothing.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.	A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.	Don't say any more.
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.	Damn you, Shelly!
Why do you do these stupid things?!	I have to.	"You don't ""have to."""	I just want you to like me.	I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.	Being a jerk is better than being nothing.	"I never said you were ""nothing""."	You don't to say it.  I can tell.	You're wrong.
I thought that was the end of the song.	Great.  Just great.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.	Who's Horace?	My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.
What?	Go out and plug the cord back in.	What?  Who pulled it out?!
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.	Alright, alright.
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.	No way...  ...I wanna rock!
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.	Well, who told me to take this cow path?	"You admit the sign did say ""Camp Forest Green,"" with an arrow pointing this way."	I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
Darren, we better turn around.	Why?	Why?  Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.	We're gonna scare him?!
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.	That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.	Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
Oh, jeez.	That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.	Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.	He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?	But that's no what worries me the most...It's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.	Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.	Better call an ambulance first.
Is that all you found?	I wish it was.
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.	He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.	Whaddya mean?	Happy Friday the 13th.
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...	Sheriff, you better take this.
....with a woman's touch.	Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.	See any paint?...  ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando.  Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine.
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!	You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.	Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.	Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
Ahh, nothing.	I could swear I heard...
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.	This is taking forever.  I'm starving.	That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.	My ass.	Yeah, that's fat too.
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.	This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
Never should've let her play.	It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.	Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
Jason who?	Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous.
But, Dad, we...	Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
When are you going to stop treating me like one!	When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...	How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?	You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
What it is?	Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.	I thought Jason was only a legend?	He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
...And I said, shut up!	All he's asking is for you to check it out.
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?	We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.	Daddy, what is going on?	And make sure my daughter stays put...  ...She's grounded.
No.  No, it's not...	Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...	Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...	I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until...
What?	Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?	Uh...yes.  But...	Then let's get goin'.  We can argue on the way.  You tell me what you need...  ...I'll make sure you get in.
You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.	Okay.  There's one.
It's all over.	It's just beginning.
So what are ya drawin'?	What's it to ya?
There...Ya happy?	No.	Why?	'Cause it stinks.
Okay, give it back.	Come and get it.
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.	Wait a minute. I just...	I thank you for getting me out. But I gotta finish what I started.
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?	It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.	Lake Forest Green?	Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
They did show up.  Isn't that great?	I hope so.
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.	Did you hear me?!	Yes.  And I said, hand me those padlocks.
So what happened?	There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
You mean you had a bad dream.	No, he was real.  Like on TV.
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?	Nancy.	Well, Nancy, I'm Paula... remember?  This is Sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. Okay?...
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?	No more.
Where'd you get this?	I found it outside.
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.	Why?	Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.	Are they grown-ups?	That's debatable.	Huh?
I can't believe no one called back.  I better...	Who ya calling?
But what if they try and scare us?	We'll scare 'em right back.
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.	But what I get scared again?	Shhh...You know what I used to do when I was a little girl when I got scared?
It's just that Darren and Lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.	All the little kids arrive today. We're not ready to deal with that alone.
So where's Cort gone off to?	Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.	Which is?	Boy scouting.	You gotta be kidding!
Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.	Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.	Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?	No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?	Of course not.  She probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it.  I still don't get it.  Why him?  I mean, he's cute alright, but...
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.	Yeah, we're here.
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.	I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.	He didn't say anything?	"Yeah, he was gonna check out ""things that go bump in the night."""
What's goin' on?	I think somebody's messin' around out there.
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.	Will you listen, dammit!	Don't piss me off, junior.  Or I will repaint this office with your brains.
Jason is alive.  We dug up his body.  I was gonna cremate it and...	Hold it.  Whoa... What's your name, son?	Tommy Jarvis.  We gotta do something.  He's even more powerful now that...
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....	Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...	And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?	Yes, but they released me because...
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...	There's no time for this bullshit...
Why didn't you cremate him?!	They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.	Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.	You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.	You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.	I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
Yes!	No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.	But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.	I've seen it.	Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we dug it up.
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.	Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.	Please don't do anything crazy.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...	If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
Doesn't that tell you something?!	Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?	How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?	Eight times.	Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --	-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.	They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
Well, let's hope not!	Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
"In the media, you've frequently been described as ""salty"" --"	-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.	I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.	Skin stretcher was human.
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --	-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?	Yes.
...but there just may not be enough time.  If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.	So let's talk.	No.  Not here.  Come by my house tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...	The what?	Save your...
Steven...	I'm here.	I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
Anything else?	Yes.
I know who you are.	I need to talk to you.	I'm kind of busy right now...	I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.	Jason Voorhees is dead.	You know he's not...and he's coming for you.	You food'll be right out.
No, I --	Twenty.	Look --	Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?	Look, I don't want your money!	Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
What do you want?	You know what I want.  You know why I need you.	You need to leave.	I know everything about you, Diana.	That's it, we're done.
Everything going okay?	It's going.	Legs giving you trouble?	Not so bad, today.
Steven buggin' you?	Do you have to ask?
Ed...	Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?	Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
I gotta get back to work.	Okay, I'll call you later.
What's the problem here?	N...nothing.
Hello...	June the 19th.
Jesus!	Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...	It's...It's all right.
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.	I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.	So's he and he knows it.
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.	Okay.	Good night, beautiful.	'Night, Josh.
Maybe you should be moving on.	Maybe you should mind your own business.	Get up!	Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
You're talking about my lady.	She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.	Goddamnit!
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.	"I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show ""bounty hunter"" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!"	That's very colorful, chief.	Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!	That's what I'd like to know.
Why did you want her body?	For a good reason.	Tell me.	Sorry.	Tell me!	Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
Lock this asshole up.	You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.	That's all right.  I was just...
She's beautiful.	Her name's Stephanie.	She's yours?
Why didn't you tell me?	I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
Does he know about what happened?	Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really lovely.	I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?	Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit.
It was a community service.	Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
What are you doing?	Showing Vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  Now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  This one, for instance.	Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...	Next, you dial a number.
...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.	Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?	Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?	Oh my God, Steven.	Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.	I'm now begging you.	Listen, since I got you on the phone -- ask the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker.  I'll send her right over.  Her name is Vicki.
Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!	Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...	Randy, c'mon!	Have a good night.
Wanna know how I did that?	Yeah...	Gotta go.  See you guys later.
Well?	I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.	Are you crazy?!	I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.	Okay.	Don't do anything stupid.	What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!	I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?	Okay.
Oh, my dear God...	He was dead.  He had to be dead...
How many times do you want to hear this?	Until I hear the truth.	I've told you the truth.	The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.	I know what it sounds like.	You don't know shit!	I didn't kill her!	Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.	She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.	About what?	About Jessica.	That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.	Look, I know I treated her bad --	-- Bad?!
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!	No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --	-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!	She did!
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.	She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!	Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?	Never.	You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?	I mean really never.	I'm sorry to hear that.  A famous man once said -- there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted.
That's disgusting.	Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
Steven!	She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.	I'm literally going to kill you!	Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.	A pizza?!
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...	The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.	Jason...Voorhees?
Have you seen Tamara?	No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.	But she might be in trouble...	So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.	I don't care about being hip anymore.
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.	Really?	I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this.
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.	He bought you that?	More or less. It's part of my college fund.
A major prick.	What are you going to do?	Improvise, of course.
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.	My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.	My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit.  He might even pay some attention to me.
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.	Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...	You're joking, right?
No thanks.	What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.	It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.	You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?	I guess not.	Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...	I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.	Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
What are you going to do?	Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
That was truly excellent.	Yeah.	Time to check out the waiters.	I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?	But...wait a minute!
Well...how do you feel?	Ask me in about five minutes.
What's wrong?	Nothing.
What murders?	Never mind, you don't want to know about it.	Tell me.	There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
Right.	I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?	Right.	So there's no reason for him to come back because there won't be any of us around...right?
Did you hear that?	Hear what?
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.	And you'll never do it again.	And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?	No.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?	Rennie's not coming.
But I thought...	She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
Where's the radio?	It's...dead.
Christ...where's Rennie??	She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...	What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose??
What's that?	The fire alarm...
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!	This is Jason's fault!	Not another word, do you hear me??
Dear Christ...	We have to get off this ship!!
Jason's here in New York.	Don't be ridiculous!
All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?	Perfectly.
What are you doing in here?	Nothing.
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.	They're out of town.	Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
Where did you get that alcohol?	I packed it. Just for us.
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.	But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?	Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.	Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York.
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.	Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
You have no right...	And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.	She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.	And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.	I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.	No, I think it's just the beginning.
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...	Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
I thought I told you to stay away from her.	Where is she?
I demand to know what is going on...	Oh dear God...
What are you doing??	That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.	But that doesn't prove that he's the one!	Walking corpses are not real!
Did you find Rennie?	She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
He's doing the best he can, Charles.	He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
I doubt very much that one even exists.	What are you talking about?	Use some common sense! Setting off a fire alarm causes panic...the same kind of panic caused by suggesting Jason Voorhees is on board.  Enough is enough.
What did you do with Rennie??	Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
There must be a phone around here somewhere.	A wonderful choice of places to dock a boat, Mr. Robertson.
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.	I don't think that's such a safe idea	My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts.
What a beautiful day.	Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.	I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.	He is not.	Oh, he is indeed. And ready to pull down anybody who falls in and can't swim.	You're telling a lie.	Am I? Let's find out.
I...I can't...	You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.	I'm staying.	If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...	She didn't push me into coming.	Why are you doing this to yourself?	I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.	I'm staying.
You had me worried to death!	But Sean said...	I'm the one you should be listening to! Do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?
Can't we at least talk about it?	I refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship.	But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing?
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.	I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.	This isn't a request.
Get in the boat, Rennie!	I...I can't...	You can and you will!!
You pushed me...	I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.
I'm glad you decided to come after all.	Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.	You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.	What about not-so-great writers?
Everything okay?	Just felt a little chill.
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?	Really?	Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.	That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.	I don't know what to say...	Rennie, you're the best student I ever had...you have a real gift. If anybody can make use of that pen, it's you.
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room	Have you seen my dog anywhere?	No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The ship's only so big and there's certainly no way off it, is there?
So, are you having fun yet?	Yeah...a lot.	I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.	There's something I haven't told you...
I can't swim.	I gathered that.
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.	It's not that simple.	Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?	Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
When did this start?	About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.	After your parents passed away?
Did you have an accident in the lake?	No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.	Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees.
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.	What is your location?	I...I don't know...	Is your ship equipped with Omega satellite navigation or LORAN?	Yes...	The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
I've got the numbers.	Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
Rennie...	Hi, Sean.	I heard you weren't coming.	We changed our minds.
I got you a present.	But I didn't get you one...	Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.	I'd love to.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.	I want to go home. I want off this ship.
Can he really take us home?	Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.	What about you?	If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again.  But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...	What do you mean???
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...	Where are they?	The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them
I didn't mean for you to go!	Just radio for help, okay???
Rennie...??	The window...
Rule one, don't panic. Rule two, assess the damage and act accordingly...	Is the ship going to sink??
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.	I'm not going near any lifeboat!	But Rennie...	I'm not!!
Rennie...what'd they do to you??	Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
You have to call the police...	Please, hurry...
I used to drive a taxi.	Where you're going, mister?
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.	Very big.	I opened thousands of brains.	What did you find?	Big mess every time.	I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.	You are going where?	Crosstown.	Very bad today.
We must abandon.	What do you mean, we must abandon?	Ruptured steam pipe.
We must abandon.	Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.	Do not inhale.
I never left the garage without my Windex.	I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.	I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.	That's where I peed.
Guys ready to order?	Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.	Elliot?	This is a great young out-of-work actress.	Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
Say it again.	Alla puttanesca.	Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent.
Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.	I don't want to hear about it.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.	Shut up, Elliot.	Quietly effective.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.	Press a button and they give us money.	Ride with me. We need a haircut.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.	She wants a divorce.	Don't talk like that.	It's over, finished and done with.	That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?	I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.	But didn't we know it would happen?	Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.	Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?
Very dangerous.	Asbestos lining.	We must abandon.	Do not inhale.
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.	I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.	You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.	What do I exude?	Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.	Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.	Tonight. What's tonight?	Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.	You mean because What's-His-Name.	You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.	It's just a review.	It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.	What's the fuss? I don't get it.	That's what I said eighteen months ago.	What happened eighteen months ago?	Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.	And he was there?	Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.	That's awful.	I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.	A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?	What was it like?	I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
Is it safe?	Do we care?	I think we Nought to wait.	I say we go.	You say we go?	Do not inhale.	I'm not ready.	Here we go.
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.	I don't have the problems that artists have.
Where are you going?	Don't wait Efor me.	What about the haircut?
He carries a gun.	Then you should carry a gun.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.	Where is it?	I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.	That was a big mistake.
We're making too much of this.	No, we're not.	I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.	We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.	It's your best play, Nicky.	He'll hate it.	He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.	`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.	What?	There are things that speak to us from the past.
Shoot him.	The American theater doesn't need people like that.	Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?	Keep going west. Last building before the river.	How do you Eknow.	Paisley Porter.	What do you mean?	About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.	Had to be him.	She was very evasive.
Great game.	Unbelievable.	Classic.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.	What are you talking about?	What are we talking about?	Yes. What are you implying?
Of course I saw it.	Did you see the winning run score?	You're not making sense. Make sense.
This could be it.	This could be it.	Let's work on it.	Let's work on it.
This could Pbe it.	This could be it.
This could be it.	This could be it.	This could be it.	This could be it.	Does it feel comfortable?	Does what feel comfortable?	This could be it.	This could be it.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.	I hear Alan's sick.	Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.	You know about Adele.	What about her?	She's dying.	She died.	I talked to her two days ago.	Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.	Our Peter?	Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.	Can he get through it?	They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.	I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.	That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.	About what?	Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.	Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.	Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.	They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.	What?	The Red Sox	You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.	Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.	It can't be all that personal.
I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.	This is how we've managed to last.	We're able to surprise each other.	In and out of bed.	Because we're completely mismatched.	We don't even like each other, do we?
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?	The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.	It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.	It's your best play, Nicky.	They'll lose because they're my team.	He will absolutely hate it.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?	I go to college. I thought you knew.	Do you want to get some coffee?	I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.	What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?	Why do you need a radio?	So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?	That's completely crazy.	Is it?	Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?	She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'	And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?	Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.	I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.	Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.	Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.	You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.	She is kicking you out.	Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?	Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?	I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.	This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.	Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.	Opening night?	I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.	Take it yourself. Take a date.	I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.	I have a class. I'm late.	Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?	I'm not sure.
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.	Except I won't have a father anymore.	I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.
What will we talk about?	Everything.
Will I believe you when you tell me something?	There's nothing left for me to lie about.
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.	Daddy, wait.
Why won't you tell me your name?	It's only our first date.
I'm willing to tell you my name.	Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.	First you tell me.	Brilliantly moving.
What else?	Packs an emotional wallop.	What else?	A flat-out hit.
If you're wondering about the firearm.	Yes.	This building is not secure.
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.	We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.	What do we want?	Mystery. Deception.	Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.	What's sexy?	Knowing who a person is. Down deep.	Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?	You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
Am I really so deeply repugnant?	Yes.
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.	It's your best play, Nicky.	See, Daddy.	I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.	What else?	An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
See, Daddy.	And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
Your father said you might be here.	Two-all after six.	I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.	We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.	I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.	All right. What's been going on?	I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.	How prominent?	He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
I'll have whatever she's having.	I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.	Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning.
Opening night, Lillian.	Who the hell cares?	The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.	That's always been my problem.	And you've been extremely patient.	You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.	You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.	I'd forgotten that.	I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.	That's very lovely actually.	Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.	Be open with me. I'd like that.	There may be things you'd rather not know about.	I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.	I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?	Joanne Bourne.	Alma Wetzel.	Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?	I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.	She's my gynecologist.
I am really, deeply sorry.	It violates so many trusts.	It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.	I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.	We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.	I'm glad we're having this talk.	I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you.
What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?	This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
What's it like to shoot somebody?	I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
Great game. Red Sox are winning.	They're always winning. Until they lose.
Life is good.	Life is good.
People are dependable.	I don't know if I can say that.
All the failures, all the fatalism.	Washed away.	One more out.
It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.	What did it say?	A thousand things.	You're hurting my head.
This could be it!	This could be it!
Life is true.	Life is real.
Who is it?	I'm at the door.	Go way. I'll call a cop.	Pop, will you let me in?	Where the hell are you?	Right here. At the door.
What do you want?	It's me. Nicky.	Nicky comes on Sunday's.	Where are your glasses? Go get them.	If it's you, what are you doing here?	I'm on my way to get a haircut.	Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.	It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.	Get yourself something to eat.
We must have been heroic.	Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.	Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'	You know the answer to that.	I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.	They're only gonna lose.	Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?	The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.	It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.	It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.	But the son is suppose to stop crying.	I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.	Don't make me sit through one of your plays.	Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.	Since when did that matter?	Let's not start that again.	My back is killing me.	Where's your elastic brace?	I can't find it.	You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.	I lost it. I lose everything.	I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
`Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.	I know, Pop.	I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.	I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.	You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.	Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.	You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.	So what are you going to do about it?	What do you want me to do?	Show him who we are.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.	Everybody else does. Why not you?	You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.	Oh yeah?	Matthew, look at him. When I lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars.  Where's your white Lincoln limo?
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.	The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?	Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.	Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.	How come you got the kid with you?	Matthew's my grandson.	A grandmother. God bless you.	He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.	It's the kid's lucky day.	This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.	Now that's a complicated subject.	That's a simple subject.	Look, we're stuck here front and back. It's dinnertime for you, game time for me. Let's park the cab and go to Mannion's. What do you say, Matthew? We'll drink beer and talk baseball.
You see what you're doing, don't you?	What am I doing?	You're charming the boy.	Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.	Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.	That's my cousin, Angelo.
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.	It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
You're a family man, Frankie?	Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?	An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?	I don't know Toyota. What does he do?	And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
It's a complicated subject.	It's a simple subject.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.	Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.	It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.	"""It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."""	You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.	I want to believe.	If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.	I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.	Then say it.	Life is good.	Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
I don't know.	Matthew.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.	Because God loves a winner.	He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.	Washed away.	Because life is good.	Because faith is rewarded.
Don't worry. It's a test.	It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
This could be it!	This could be it!
Then they lost?	Why does it matter?	If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.	Why do you care?	They're my team.	No. They're not your team. They're my team.
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'	I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?	The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.	If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.	Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.	When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.	What about my play?
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?	You're out of bullets.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.	Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.	appreciate that, Sidney. But our leading man can't remember his lines. And his understudy can't carry the play.
I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.	hat was this morning.	So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
'm not worried about this kid.	Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.	Postpone. We have every right.	Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.	I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.	You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
I hate the Mets.	How come?	When the Mets lose, they just lose. It's a flat feeling. But the Red Sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate.
Have to hurry back.	Hurry back. Hurry back to what?	Eleventh inning. What else?
Game six is history,pal.	You're not making sense.
What do you mean?	To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.	Why?	Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
Yessiree, Bob.	Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
"Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know ""Macbeth""."	But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
Sidney remains optimistic.	Sidney.	Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.	I was educated by nuns.	Yes.	I have excellent long-term memory.	Yes.	I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.	Yes, Peter.	But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.	You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.	What color?	What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?	Burnt sienna.	Mine was cobalt blue.	This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.	Yes.	I kissed her while she was laughing.	Yes.	I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
And the Father replies?	That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
This could be it.	I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
What's good?	We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
You've worked with Elliot?	I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?	There was a review.	I think I remember.	So does Elliot.	Not one of Steven's finer moments.	Oh. You know him.	A little.	And he has finer moments now and then.	He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --	Endearing.	Engaging.	Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.	A little drastic maybe?	Say it again.	What?	You know what.	Alla puttanesca.	One more time.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?	I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.	I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.	I hear good things about the new play.	So do I. Over and over.	Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.	Would you like to meet him?	He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.	I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.	The fact is, I have to get going.	Is it true?	Is what true?	He wears a disguise.	Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.	But you're his friend.	Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
Do you think he can do it?	I don't know.	He's a very sweet man.	Where are you going now?	Home.	Someone waiting for you?	No one's waiting.	There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?	If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?	So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.	But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?	I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.	Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.	Yes.	Never mind.
What? Come on, Paisley.	Our Steven not only disguises himself.	Yes.	He goes to the theater armed.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.	I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.	I haven't come to you.	But you're here. So you must have come to me.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.	Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.	Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.	The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.	And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.	I don't want you, Steven.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.	I'm going home to my machine.
"""A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest."" -- I told you about English law."	As I told you about English policemen.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.	They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
"Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- ""a monstrous attack."""	Are you sure?	Yes -- I can't talk like this.
Oww!	Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.	Everyone takes his turn.	It is the work of untouchables.	In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!	I am your wife.	All the more reason.
Please! You're being foolish!	There's no room! And the air is lovely.
God gave you ten thumbs.	Eleven.
"""Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."""	"""I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."""
"""Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."""	"""I will follow you in all our vows and duties."""
No -- prison is rather agreeable to me, and there is no doubt that after the war, independence will come. My only worry is what shape it will take. Jinnah has --	Stop!
"""...what shape it will take."" Jinnah has -- what?"	Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
But do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler?	Not without defeats -- and great pain.  But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain?  What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?	No. That is what you get for distracting me.	What do you expect when you talk like that?	I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.	I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
Enough.	One more.
Just an admirer...	Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.	I'm sorry.	I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.	Some of it good, I hope.
You're a clergyman.	Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?	Not anymore.  At first I was amazed... but when you are fighting in a just cause, people seem to pop up -- like you -- right out of the pavement. Even when it is dangerous or --
That was lucky.	I thought you were a man of God.	I am. But I'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas.
"That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this ""farm""..."	Well, we shall try.
No violence, please.	Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
What are you doing?	Going nearer to God!
"Not quite. They're only ""holding me"" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison."	Did they take your clothes?
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.	I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.	Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
"They're calling you ""Bapu."" I thought it meant father."	It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.	How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?	Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a long time.
You mean Gandhi?	Back in South Africa...  long time ago.	What was he like?	Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.	Well, he must've found some of the answers...
What'd he say?	He said he's in charge...
Tell me -- do you think about hell?	"""Hell!"""	No -- neither do I. But...  but this man is a Christian and he has written --
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?	A -- a week.	Well, I don't know how you got a ticket for --
I'll take your luggage back, baas.	No, no -- just a moment, please.
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.	I thought you were against fighting.
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.	I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...	The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.	I've never spoken for anything else.
What can we do?	We must end the campaign.
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.	It was one incident.	Tell that to the families of the policemen who died.
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!	Panditji -- please, help me.
And Jinnah?	He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.	Wait and see... wait and see...
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.	I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
What do you want?	That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
Without a paper -- a journal of some kind -- you cannot unite a community.  You belong to a very important profession.	"Hm. And what should an ""important professional"" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?"	"I don't know... I'm still searching for a ""response."""	You will respect the law.	There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
"Well, it's quite a place, your ""ashram"" -- is that right?"	"That's right. The word only means ""community."" But it could stand for ""village""... or the world."
You're an ambitious man.	I hope not.
It's beautiful.	Even as a boy I thought so.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?	Hm.  Is it?	Perhaps. I've come here to think about it.
Do you remember much of South Africa?	A great deal.	I've traveled so far -- and thought so much.  As you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians.  The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped.
You've done me a great service.	It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
Is it over if they arrest you now?	Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
Are you going to walk all the way?	My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.	Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.	I would rather march.	First spin. Let the others march for a time.
Do you find me stubborn?	I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.	You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.	No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.	I --
The honor is ours. May I introduce Mr. Kallenbach. He's an old friend  and his interest is in flowers. I presumed to tell him he could wander your gardens while we talked.	I'll send my gardener. I'm sure you'll have much to discuss.
You mean a general strike?	I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.	An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!	Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
Who is that young man?	That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.	I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.	Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.	No.
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.	Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.	Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.	That's when you take advantage.
We need your help!	There is nothing I can give.
In England, I was a poor student but I --	That was England.
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?	"I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less ""holy"" than Mr. Baker."
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.	Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?	I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England.  And I will use the courts.
They're sparing no one, I see.	No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.	So did I.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?	My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.	The fools!  Sorry...	It's split the Government.	Well, that's one victory.
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.	Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
Will you have a glass of sherry?	Thank you. No.
Perhaps some tea?	I dined at the prison.	Ahh.
"Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such ""exception"" to."	Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.	Somehow I expected not.
I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?	Very well.
"Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to ""investigate"" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed."	I congratulate them.
You're an extraordinary man.	I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
Assuming we are in agreement?	Yes -- yes. It's just that... in these clothes I'd -- I'd prefer to go by taxi.	All right. Fine.	I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.	Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
"And that's the basis of this ""Declaration of Independence""?"	"Yes, sir. The day he sets off everyone is supposed to raise the flag of ""Free India."" Then he walks some two hundred and forty miles to the sea and makes salt."
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.	Who's leading them?	I don't know! Nehru, Patel, almost every Congress Official is in jail... and their wives and their children -- we've even arrested Nehru's mother.
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?	Yes, sir, he has. The usual -- India's salt belongs to India -- but then he says flatly that he personally is going to lead a raid tomorrow on the Dharasana Salt Works.	Thank him for his letter, and put him in jail.
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?	"He's ""discovering"" India."
Have you read his magazine?	No -- but I think I'm going to.
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.	If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.	Have you found him?
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.	...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
Could we cut all news off? I know --	Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
You almost sound like you believe that.	Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.	There are a few million miles to go yet.	It's over.	Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?	It's for the best.	God, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what I <i>can't</i> do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing.  But <i>you</i> did, once.
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?	You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.	Who are you trying to convince?	I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?	Now is your chance to find out.
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!	Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.	You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.	He's right, Maria.  That's right.
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?	Er, no...	Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.	I like football.	I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going to be at least a head taller than you. Prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time.
How much extra?	It would be five thousand more.
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.	Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.	Not yet, I'm afraid.	No?  What's keeping you?	I guess I'm a slow learner.	I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.	I'll see what I can do.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.	By the way, I left some trash in your locker.	I'll take care of it.
I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.	A man's dead, Detective.	Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...	Grudges?	I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.	No, <i>this</i> is your man.	With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--	--What <i>about</i> his profile?
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.	So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?	No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.	"Who knows with these ""deficients""?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence."	I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--	--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.	What a pity.	Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.	This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
"--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it ""likely"" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?"	Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.	Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?	With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.	I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.	We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.	This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.	A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?	"No.  But one or two ""borrowed ladders"" have shown up there in the past."
"Of course.  He's a ""de-gene-erate"".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder."	It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.	It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.	Don't underestimate these imposters.	None of the ID photos match the enhancement.	A man can change his face--but blood is forever. Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.  Intravenous.
You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days.  At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.	Blood.  From the vein.
That's the last.	Something's not right.	He's not here.  It's a blind alley.	No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.	We don't have the manpower.	Get it.  From outside, if you have to.	From what budget?	I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
What are you waiting for?	Where do we start?	We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
Positive saliva match.  The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.	So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?	Luca could still be an accomplice.
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.	Where did you get this?
How often do you test, Director?	Often.	Surely you know what you have.	We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
We believe we have a suspect.	What a relief.	This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?	Thank you, no.	One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.	You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.	Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.	No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
Twelve have a mission within the week.	This time I will supervise each test personally.
At least it's nothing contagious.	I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
Hello.	Jerome--?	Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up.
Good to see you're feeling better.	"Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your ""friends""?"	It's about the Director.	Again?
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.	I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?	He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.	What's wrong with him?	You have more in common than you know.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?	Six one.	He's too tall.
You okay, Jerome?	Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
What's wrong with it?	I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.	Suit yourself.	Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?	German.	You're both going to a lot of trouble--  Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own.  I'm sure you're sincere...  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
I don't know exactly, Jerome.	At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
I have to know where you come from.	If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.	What about this?	Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
It needs work.	You had to be a right-hander.	Noone orders southpaws anymore.
You really need that much?	<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.	God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?	Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.	God, you're serious, aren't you?
It's not too late to back out.	You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?	Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
Who died?	The Mission Director.	You wish.	They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.	He was still warm when they confirmed.	This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?	The place is crawling with Hoovers.	So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?
That's not the point.	"Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the ""J. Edgars"" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately."	You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got my final physical tomorrow.
Let's get out of here.	You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!	Keep going!!  Keep going!!
At least up there your piss will be worth something.  You'll all be showering in it, right?	And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.	What <i>is</i> that one?
11.15 to the port.  A maintenance crew.	How long do you stay up there before you go?	A day or so.	I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.	You know I'm scared of heights.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.	It's okay, Eugene.	You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--	--What car?--Go to sleep.	--I walked right in front of it.  I was never more sober in my life.
It's all right.	I'm proud of you, Vincent.
Call German.	Any particular reason?	We can't stay here.	What are you talking about?	They think I offed the Director.
What makes them think that?	They found my eyelash.	Where?	In a corridor.	Could be worse.  They could have found it in your eye.
Come on--we're taking off.	I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--	--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.	Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.	They'll recognize me.	How could they recognize you?  <i>I</i> don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  This is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken worse heat than this.  Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me now.  I've put too much into this.  Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>.  I had other offers, you know.  I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?	I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
You really had other offers?	I'm sure I could have.
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.	You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.	Is that all?	I've got enough on my mind without that.	If you say so.  The stripe.	Good choice.
Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.	I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.	Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.	If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
How was your evening?	Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.	"You <i>are</i> a catch.  No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to ""breed up"".  What's wrong with her?"	You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.	You're not thinking of telling her, are you?	Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.	She doesn't <i>have</i> to know.  She doesn't <i>want</i> to know.
Where are we going?	I'm sorry.  I've got plans.	Again?	She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.	I'm sure you'll be very convincing.
Where are you taking her?	Michael's.
Everybody goes there.	You may as well invite her here.	Will you be okay?	Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.	We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.	How long?	"By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, ""How are you?""  Forty-five minutes later I reply, ""Not bad.  How are you?"""	I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
Hello?	How would you like to be yourself for the day?	I was never very good at it, remember?
How are you, Jerome?	Not bad, Jerome.	How the hell did you get here.	I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
I have your samples ready.	Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.	No, but you might need them when you get back.
Why have you done this?	In case you get back before I do.	Where are you going?	I'm travelling too.
Thank you.	I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?	We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--	--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
Anything I've forgotten?	We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.	I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.	Antonio, the choir...	I have to caution you it's not fool-proof. With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.
What will happen to the others?	"They are not babies, Maria, merely ""human possibilities""."
What do you think?	I think I could do something  provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
Vincent...Vincent...	German, is that you?	Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.	I hope he's not just a body.	No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--	How do I square the accident?	It happened in Australasia.  He checked in yesterday.  No family complications, no record he ever broke his neck.  As far as anybody's concerned, he's still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. You just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life.  Excuse me, <i>your</i> life.
	That's the hair color in his profile?
Yeah.	I'd have to bleach my hair.	Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.	How tall are you?
You can wear lifts.	Even with lifts I'm never that tall.	There's a way.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.	Why not?	These new personality corrections I've been reading about.	You worried about the cost?	Not that.	They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
Hugo!  I've found him!	I've found him too.	A fingerprint.  There's something to be said for nostalgia.  What did you find?
No bother.	I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.	Last night?  I was at home.
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?	No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?	I was at home.	Were <i>you</i> alone?	Yes.	So we don't know for sure about you, either.	No.	Why don't we say we were together?	Why would we do that?	I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.	We were just looking.	I know about you.
Have they found our friend?	Friend?	It was a mercy-killing after all.	They found an eyelash.	Where?	In the South Wing.	Does it have a name?	Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.	You celebrate, Jerome?
You didn't know?	Yes...<i>yes</i>...	You're angry--	Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.
I envy you, Jerome.	You'll be next.	I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here.
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.	What exactly is wrong?	Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
Of course I think about it every day.	Of course.
So you didn't do it after all.	I guess somebody beat me to it.
What <i>is</i> this place?	You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
Why are we leaving?	Those checks take forever.
What about the car?	Let's walk.	Who are they?	It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
I can't.	Come on.	My medication.  I left it back there.	We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
What happened?	You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.	So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.	"But ""if it came to it"" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?"	You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?	That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
What is it?	I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
--when you go away.	We could go together one day.
A year is a long time.	Not so long--just once around the sun.
Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?	Only every time I'm in here.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.	I'll tell you at the end of the week.
I've got enough here.	Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
What's this, Lamar?	New policy.
Flight got you nervous?	There's a problem, Lamar.	Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?  He's a big fan of yours.  He wants to apply here.
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--	--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
What are you doing?	I can't do this.	I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.	No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
The doctor will give you something.	I'm not doing it.	Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.	Not like <i>this</i> one.	Honey, look around you.  The world doesn't want one like <i>that</i> one.
The name?  For the certificate.	Antonio--
You gotta be kidding.	Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
All it takes is a long arm.	Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.	I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.	This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.	I get my own help.	You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
What about them?	They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...	I heard about you. You work with Miller.
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?	They will be ready. You guys do your job.	I'll take care of my end.	Stay clean.
Hello, McCoy.	Beynon.	News said two persons killed.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.	And you got him...	That's right.
What about your wife?	What about her?  Let's c ut up the money, I want to get North.
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.	They may nail me into this now, McCoy.	That's your problem.	You know, you and I may be two of a kind.	No way. I always do my own work.
I'm in a hurry.	You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.	No applause!
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.	I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.	What do you add up to here?	One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.	A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.	So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.	The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.	No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.	Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.	I bet.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.	Get it over with...
We'll try again.	No way. I've got to get out now.
Hello, Doc.	Hi.	You okay?	I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
You want to drive?	My license expired, let's get out of here.	Sure...
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.	It looks fine.
Feel good?	Yeah.	Where do you want to go?	I want to take a walk.
It doesn't look like that.	What do you mean? You've never been there.	I've been there every day for the last four years.
What's Beynon got set up?	Small town, small bank, big money.
Where did you get those?	I've been doing my homework.	Just like old times?	Better than old times.	I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.	I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.	Where did you get them developed?	Assumed name... Houston.	Good.
Half a million.	That Beynon's got a long arm.	What do you want for dinner?	Whisky and a peach.
How does it taste?	Just the way I remembered.
You been okay?	Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.	How's Estelle?	Fatter... some things never change.	Boring.	Nothing's been boring since you found me.	That's not all of it.	No. It's been a long time.
You go out much?	After four years and now the question comes up.	Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.	I'm still here, Doc.
I guess I'm kind of...	It's all right.	It's just been a while.	We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
Wait... give me a minute.	Sure.
I'll be okay.	Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.	Really?	Really.
How was it?	Better than I remembered.
I was going to fix you breakfast.	You were asleep.	I bought you a lot of new things.
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.	Suit yourself.
$250,000 right off the top.	Is he straight?	You got the parole, didn't you?
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.	I couldn't have... much longer.	Yeah... I know.	But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
Why are you laughing?	I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.	That doesn't hurt.	But sometimes I cried a lot too.	I didn't. I just waited.	Want to cry now?
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...	Usually on the right side as you go in.	Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.	For exits off Main Street.	Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.	If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
You know how I feel?	My mind's not on guessing games.
Promise you won't laugh.	If it's funny I'm going to laugh.	I feel like the night before the first day of school.	That bad?
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.	Waiting's hard. You never learn how.	You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.	At least you were outside.	It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.	Bullshit.	I mean it.	I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.	We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.	We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.	... and live happily ever after.
What about the bank?	Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
Doc...	I see it...
They checked in.	Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --	Why?	There are three men dead.	So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.	He might be ready to chop us up.	Do it my way.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.	"I've never ""been there... When we met it was in his office."
Do you trust him?	I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.	Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.	If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.	I don't want to go there.	Do it my way.
Why didn't you tell me?	There wasn't any way to explain it.	Yeah.	You sent me to him.	When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?	What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?	Who's she?	She's on TV.	If you don't start telling the truth...	What do we do?	We keep going.
A man helped me open it...	And switched keys.	He must have.	It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
How long ago.	Fifteen minutes.	Sure?
There better be a guy with the	You bastard...
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.	I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.	Texas is a big state.	I can handle it.	I'll bet you can.	You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?
When we had trouble before it was different.	You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things	What do you want to do?	Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.	Do you mean that?	I mean it.
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.	You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?	When they find it, they find it.
You've got it all figured.	No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.	Like what?
There may be a hunting party.	Why, there's nothing on the news?	I didn't mean police.
What?	If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
You're full of ifs.	I think you liked it with him.
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?	El Paso.
That would be the first time.	When are you going to learn?	I did I killed a man.
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.	If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
You can't trust anything these days.	I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!	You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
Only one car.	Let's do it.
Where are you going?	El Paso.
How much?	Twenty eight hundred.
Are you hungry?	Not now.
Okay?	I think so... I don't know.
No scars?	No scars.
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.	It's all a game, don't bother me.
We better stick here till tonight.	Yeah.
We're going to make it.	Sure...
I want to say something.	I don't want to hear it.	Listen to me. It's hard enough.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.	I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...	We got this far.	We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.	I guess you're right.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.	Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.	No more about Beynon.	Whatever happens it's over.
Sounds good.	You want to try with me?	Things can't get much worse can they?	I don't see how.
Okay.	You and me.	Can we make it?	We get to Mexico, we can have a life.	That's all I want... It's the only thing I have ever wanted.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.	Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.	Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.	Oh, Jesus... how?	Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.	I'll be ready.	Yeah.	What's wrong?	I don't know.	Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.	Whatever you say.
What is it?	Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.	So what?	If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
You're crazy.	Get your clothes on, move your butt.
Come on, come on.	Who was it?	Just get your clothes on...
You okay?	Where do we go from here?	I don't know, airport I guess.	They will have our description before we can get a plane.	Yeah.
How long before this car's hot?	Pull over.
Are we going to make it?	Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.	Whatever happens... we're going all the way.	Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.	I guess we are.
What now?	We walk.
That's right.	Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
Where's home?	Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?	No, I'm not.	Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.	That certainly makes you kind of special...	Yeah... I guess it does.
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?	No, I'm afraid not.	I never have any luck.
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.	I really hope you have a nice trip.	Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.	Oh my God.	That little job cost me a hundred dollars... didn't even get to keep the fish.
Hope you get to where you're going.	Thanks. Hope you do too.	By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?	Tell her you robbed a bank...
Can I help you?	Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.	All right. Shells?	Two boxes of double-ought buck.	Gonna knock down a wall?	Might try that.
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.	Where?	Chicago.	You were with him?	Yeah. I got out.	What about you?
Just in case someone gets a shot off.	I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.	Suit yourself.	Okay. How many bank exits?	Two.	What about the vault?	Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...	Wire pull over?	One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.	I'm good at that.	I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...	Whatever you need.
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie«s. Okay. Any questions?	Aren't we going a little hard?	What do you have in mind?	It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.	Dillinger got killed.
How's Mama and the kids?	Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.	My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.	Just sandwiches...	Right.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.	He took the day off.	Then you do it.	Can't leave the desk.
Drive.	Suit yourself.
How was that?	Just fine.	Where we go in1?	Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.	Why not?
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?	I kinda doubt it.
Let's just get to the border.	Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
Which way?	Juarez - Chihuahua City road.	Don't you want to go to the airport?	Not now.
Listen... how much money did you make this year?	What's it to you?	Come on. How much?	'Bout five thousand.	How about if I buy your car for ten grand?	You serious?	Sure am.	And I keep my mouth shut?	That's what I want.	I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?	You got it.	How about twenty thousand?
You're going to have to walk back to the border.	Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.	Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.	Go with God.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?	Just... tell us what you want.
What kind of car do you have, Harold?	A Ford... We have a Ford.	That's good. That's very good. Now Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. One more thing... If anybody but you comes back...
You do what he says, Harold.	After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.	That right?	You can trust him...	How long have you been married?	Two years.	Can he trust you?	That's what matters, isn't it?
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?	I Just want to find a suitcase.
What's the damage?	Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.	I got a nurse in mind.	The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...	The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.	That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
I've got to stop.	I'll tell you when.
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.	Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.	I know. I know.
You can't get away from me, Albert.	I know.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.	Did Eric Pake pull her?	Yes.	How?	I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.	When did you find out?	A couple of weeks back.	How?	No choice. I had a visit from somebody.	Who?	Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.	And you told Brumby?
Do you want to be dead, Albert?	Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.	What did you do?  Albert?	Nothing. What could I do?	Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?	Yes. I told him.	What did he say?	'Good.'
You knew what I'd do.	Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
What do you want?	What happened to this car?	What's it got to do with you?	This is my brother's car.	Oh ay?	Yeah.	Well, he drove it into the river.	Was the steering faulty?
What about the brakes?	Fine. Nowt wrong with them.	How'd it happen, then?	He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.	Was he?
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!	I know.	Well?
I made a mistake.	What?	I made a mistake.	What about?	Never mind.
Bloody well tell me who sent you.	You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?	Yes.	Last night, after you'd gone, I did a little bit of asking around. Seeing as you weren't very forthcoming,  It seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?  I got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back,  You know my life. Machines. The arcades. Nice business. Looks after itself. People put money in. I take it out. Not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. But recently, I've had a spot of bother,  One of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.  So far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,  So I'm worried. I can't fight them  I haven't that kind of set-up. But I've got to fix them before they fix me. Trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead.
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.	What name?	Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.	Why?	I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.	Why?	I don't know. That's all I was told.
That's not good enough.	Christ, what...	Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.	Jack, you're wrong.	Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.	Jack...
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.	I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
Jack?	Good evening.	I'd like a word with you, Jack.	That's nice.	Confidential, like.	You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.	That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?	I've been asked to make sure you don't.	Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey?
Who paid you to see me off?	I can't Jack. How can I?	Yes you can.
No, don't Jack, don't.	Who sent you, Thorpey?	Brumby!
Where's he living these days?	He's got a new place at Burnham.	Address?	On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
Can I go now?	You must be joking,  Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit.
Everyhing go off all right?	Fine...  I want to talk to you.	What about?	Doreen.
She's nothing to do with me.	What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.	No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?	Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
Really.	I must go. I'm in a hurry.	I want to talk to you later.	I can't.	Tomorrow morning, then?
How were things between you and Frank?	He was all right to me.	Nothing more? Just another feller?	Nicer than most.	But he was just another feller, wasn't he?	Yes.	Though nicer than most?	Yes. I can't help the way I am.	Why'd you see him so regular?	Once a week?	I call that regular.	He was gentlemanly. I like that.	Once a week you like a gentleman?	Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?	What was bugging Frank?	He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?	It's the truth.
It is. Honestly.	You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?	I don't know nothing.
You know Sid Fletcher?	What?	You know Sid Fletcher?	I work for him.	Do you?	Yes, I do.
I know him too.	Who?	Sid Fletcher.	Oh, do you?	Yes.	No, do you really?
Yes. I met him last year.	Go on.	Oh yes. When he came up on business.	Really?	He came to see Mr Kinnear.	No.
We went about together.	Really?	Yes, while he was here.	While he was here. You went about together?	He was here for four days.	Was he?	Could you do me a favour?	Yeah, I'll do you a favour.	Could you please put my glass on the table?
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?	No. I didn't know that.	A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?	So where are we going, Princess?	To the demon king's castle, of course.	Of course. Where else?
How'd you know where I'd be?	You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.	Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!	Nasty.	He must have been pretty sure I'd come.	Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.	And what was that?	We're there now.
Who's setting you up in this place?	Brumby.	Is he coming here?	Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?	He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
What does he want that bloody great country place for?	Entertaining.	What kind of entertaining?	Now you're asking.
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?	Especially when I play the lead.
That's why you waited for me.	Not entirely. No.	You sure about that?	Sure I'm sure.
I want to give you an Oscar.	You've been watching the film.	Tell me about the girl.	What girl?	The young girl. Who pulled her?	I don't know.	Was it Albert?	Shouldn't think so.	Is it one of Kinnear's films?	Yeah.	Who set it up?  Eric?	Yeah.	Then he must have pulled her.	Expect so.	Did my brother Frank find out?	Your brother? What you talking about?
Now tell me the truth.	The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.	And you didn't know her last name?	No.	Well, it's Carter. That's my name,  And her father was my brother. And he was murdered last Sunday. Now get up and get dressed.
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.	Nice of you to come.	No. Frank was a good bloke.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.	Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.	Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.	Have another?	No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.	No. It's all right.	Thanks for coming.	Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
Sorry about your father.	Yeah.	Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?	They said he was drunk.
How's school?	I left last year.	Oh, what you doing now?	Working at Woolworths.	That must be interesting.	Yes.
You all right now?	Yeah.	You coming to South America?	No.
Where you going to live, then?	At me friend's house.	Where's that?	Wilton Estate.	Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.	Thanks.
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.	What?	I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.	Did you work with him, Keith?	At the Half Moon.
I mean, what for?	That's what I was wondering.	Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.	Why would it?	It just would. He was always the same.	Since when did he drink whisky?	Don't know.	Nobody seems to know.
You work here, Keith?	Yes.
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?	Right.	I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift?	Yeah. He comes in here a bit.	Where would I find him?	Today? At the races. He always goes.
How'd you know Albert?	Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
What you having, Jack?	Large Scotch.
Heard of a man called Thorpe?	Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.	That's what he was saying about you.
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.	That's nice. What'd you tell him?	Nowt.	Good lad.
See you later.	Where you off to?	Las Vegas.
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.	How many?	Four of them.
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.	Who's Brumby?	Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea?
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?	Yeah.	Ten to one, it belonged to Cliff Brumby, and like as not the bloody arcade as well. Right along the coast. Isn't that right, Thorpey?
What happened to you, then?	How'd you find me?
Did they give you a rough time?	No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.	No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?	Get knotted.	All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.	Oh yes? How?
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?	I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
I won't be using the room tonight.	I see.	I'm staying with a friend.	Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?	It's not like that, luv.	It never is.
Are you a traveller?	Definitely.	Will this do?	Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.	Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.	You sure?
Ta.	I'll bet this one's seen some action.
What is it?	My brother, Frank.	Is he staying the night?	Funny.  Can I phone London?	It'll cost you.
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?	I'm sorry.	You don't look it.	No. Really, I am.	Don't come that bloody flannel with me. If you're a traveller, I'm bloody Twiggy.  And who's he?
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?	Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
And what you going to do?	Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.	I'll call the police.	No, you won't.
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.	Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...	Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
Now just a minute...	Ta-ra.
You sod.	They came back?	No.
What'll they do to him?	Don't ask me.
They bloody hurt me.	You're lucky. They kill as well.	And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?
Thorpey nearly died laughing.	That little shit!	What about Keith?	What about Keith?	What you going to do?	Pension him off.	You're a bastard.	What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
So shut up.	What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?	You wouldn't.	How'd you know I wouldn't?	'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.	What's that supposed to mean?	Think about it.
Are you awake?	No.	Do you want breakfast?	You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?	Uh-huh.
Did you sleep well?	Yes, thank you.
Are you tired?	No. Are you tired?	No. I'm not tired,  Do you eat breakfast?
Do us a favour?	What, and get myself beaten up again?	No chance of that.	Not much.	They're friends of mine.	And that'll make me feel better?	I don't want to get rough, do I?
What you going to do?	I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
You coming back?	How could I stay away?
Is he?	Jack Carter.	Eric. Eric Paice.	What you doing around here then?	Didn't you know this is my home town?	No, I didn't know that.	Funny, that.
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?	No. I'm visiting relatives.	Oh, that's nice.	It would be. If they were still living.	Meaning what?	A bereavement. A death in the family.	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.	That's all right, Eric.
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?	Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?	Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.	What are you doing? Advertising Martini?	Oh, you've been watching television.	Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
What's it to you anyway?	I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.	That's not always a healthy way to be...	And you should know, if I remember rightly.
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.	Making a living.	Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension?  Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like.
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.	Still got a sense of humour?	Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?	Can't say I do.
Jack! I didn't like that.	You should have told me who you were working for.	Cyril didn't like it, either.	Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?	He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in.
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.	Not till I'm dead, Eric.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.	Sod off.
Eh? Have a drink.	Still got your sense of humour.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.	Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?	Scotch, please.	Piss off, Ray.
Eric told me of your bereavement.	Yep.	Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!	No? Funny that. Neither did I.	If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.	Yeah.	Nasty way to go.	Yes.
Not going, Jack?	I have to. Things to see to.	Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.	Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.	We've got to take you back to London.	He said it'd be doing him a big favour.
We know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid.	But they have to be diplomatic.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.	The gun he means.
Gerald wants to see him first.	Shut up.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?	They do that up North.	What for? Protective purposes?
Ask me?	Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
Not suede boots!	Knock it off, Gerald.	What? And get the clap?
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?	Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.	You're bluffing, you bastard!	That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
What's that? A hundred?	That's right, Harry.	Your hundred, and another hundred.
What's that?	That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.	Three hundred altogether?	Three hundred altogether, Harry.
All right. Two hundred.	Ha.
What's that?	That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
Four hundred?	That's right.	You're not seeing me?	No.
I'll see you, then.	Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.	Shut up.
Polacks and deadbeats.	...Polacks...	Deadbeats all.	...they hold on to their money...	All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.	Where am I going to work?
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.	I'm not?	You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.	I had to.	You had to, yeah.  Why?	To get on the...	To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.	I'd never try to sell an Indian.	"You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, ""Patel?"""	Mmm...	You ever get 'em?	Well, I think I had one once.	You did?	I...I don't know.
"You had one you'd know it.  Patel. They keep coming up.  I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen.  They're lonely, something.  They like to feel superior, I don't know.  Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down ""The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah,"" ""The Mountain View--"" ""Oh yes.  My brother told me that..."" They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like it. Christ..."	What?	"The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I...""I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch,"" ""or I don't win the Cadillac..."" We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."""	They came in and they, you know...	Well, they fucked it up.
They did.	They killed the goose.	They did.	And now...	We're stuck with this...	We're stuck with this fucking shit...	...this shit...	It's too...	It is.	Eh?	It's too...	You get a bad month, all of a...	You're on this...	"All of, they got you on this ""board..."""	I, I...I...	Some contest board...	I...	It's not right.
It's not.	No.
And it's not right to the customers.	I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.	That's right?	Eh...?	That's right?	"Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: ""Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."""	...that's right...	Eh?	No.  That's absolutely right.	And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...	...that's right...	...cower in his boots...
Shoes, boots, yes...	"For some fuckin' ""Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."""	For some sales pro...	"...sales promotion, ""You lose, then we fire your..."" No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. ""Or we're going to fire your ass."" It's wrong."	Yes.	Yes, it is.  And you know who's responsible?	Who?	You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.	No.	"Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you ""Get out there and close."" ""Go win the Cadillac."" Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?"	Yes.
"That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! ""Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"""	Nurses.	So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...	He is?	He's doing very well.	I heard that they were running cold.	The nurses?	Yes.	You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.	With River Oaks?	River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.	Himself?
That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.	The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.	"What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say ""Good morning,"" nothing...nothing..."	No, it's not that simple, Dave...	Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?	What?	Starting up.	What hard part?	Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?	What?	Just the act.	What act?
"To say ""I'm going on my own."" 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those..."	That's right...	He made up those rules, and we're working for him.	That's the truth...	"That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: ""Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."""	Huh.	You don't ax your sales force.	No.	You...	You...	You build it!	That's what I...	You fucking build it!  Men come...	Men come work for you...
...you're absolutely right.	They...	They have...	When they...	Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.	What?	I want to tell you what somebody should do.	What?	Someone should stand up and strike back.	What do you mean?	Somebody...	Yes...?	Should do something to them.	What?
Something.  To pay them back.  Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.	Someone should hurt them.	Yes.	How?	How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.	What?
Someone should rob the office.	Huh.	That's what I'm saying.  We were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin' leads out of the files...go to Jerry Graff.
What could somebody get for them?	What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
How many leads have we got?	The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.	And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.	Yes.	How do you know he'd buy them?	Graff?  Because I worked for him.	You haven't talked to him.	No.  What do you mean?  Have I talked to him about this?
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...	No, we're just...	"We're just ""talking"" about it."	We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.	As an idea.	Yes.	We're not actually talking about it.
No.	Talking about it as a...	No.	As a robbery.	"As a ""robbery""?!  No."	Well.  Well...	Hey.
So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff.	Not actually, no.
You didn't?	No.  Not actually.	Did you?	What did you say?	"Yes.  I said, ""Not actually."" The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking..."	We are?
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.	That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.	You're actually talking about this?	That's right.
You're going to steal the leads?	Have I said that?
Did I say that?	Did you talk to Graff?	Is that what I said?	What did he say?	What did he say?  He'd buy them.
Yes.	What will he pay?	A buck a shot.	For five thousand?	However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.	"You're saying ""me."""	Yes.  Twenty-five hundred apiece.  One night's work, and the job with Graff.  Working the premium leads.
A job with Graff.	Is that what I said?	He'd give me a job.	He would take you on.  Yes.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.	What?	What?  What?  The leads.	You have to steal the leads tonight?	That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.	You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...	You...	I'm sorry?	You.
Me?	You have to go in.  You have to get the leads.
Yes.	I...	"It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  ""The fucking leads"" et cetera, blah blah blah ""...the fucking tight ass company..."""	They'll know when you go over to Graff...	What will they know?  That I stole the leads?  I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn.  Why did I go to Graff?  I got a better deal. Period.  Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case.
Dave.	Yes.	You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?	Yes.
Oh, yes, George.	What does that mean?	Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?	What if you don't get caught?	They come to you, you going to turn me in?	Why would they come to me?	They're going to come to everyone.	Why would I do it?	You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?	No.	Are you sure?	Yes.  I'm sure.	Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight.  That's something I have to do.  If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this, then I have to come in here...
...you don't have to come in...	...and rob the place...	...I thought that we were only talking...	...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.	Me?	Absolutely.	That's ridiculous.	Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.	I didn't ask to be.	Then tough luck, George, because you are.	Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?	That's right.	Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?	That's none of your fucking business...
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...	You went for it.	In the abstract...	So I'm making it concrete.	Why?	Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?	Do you need five grand?	Is that what I just said?	You need money?  Is that the...	Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?	What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...	I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.	I do?	Yes.
And why is that?	Because you listened.
Can we get some coffee...?	How ya doing?
Fine.	Uh-huh.	If anyone's going, I could use some coffee.
I, you know, they should be insured.	What do you care...?
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...	Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?	I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?	I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.	I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...	What?  You can't do any what?
I can't close 'em.	Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.	Yes.	Huh?	Yes.  They are old.	They're ancient.	Clear...	Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
It is dead.	It's a waste of time.	Yes.  I'm no fucking good.	That's...	Everything I...you know...	That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.	I am?	You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.	He said he filed...	He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?	They stole...	They stole the...
What.  What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone...	They stole the phones.	Where criminals can come in here... they take the...	They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit...
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?	Down the street.
Were the leads...	...what am I going to do all month...	Were the leads insured?
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.	What?
He said we...	To the cops?	Yeah.	Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.	A waste of time?  Why?	Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.	The cops?	Yes.  The cops.  No.	They aren't?	No.	Why don't you think so?	"Why?  Because they're stupid. ""Where were you last night..."""	Where were you?	Where was I?	Yes.	I was at home, where were you?	At home.
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?	Was I?	Yes.	No.	Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?	No.	You have nothing to hide.	When I talk to the police, I get nervous.	Yeah.  You know who doesn't?	No, who?	Thieves.	Why?	They're inured to it.	You think so?	Yes.
Will you excuse...	Where did Moss...?  I...	Will you excuse us please?	Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I...
Did they...?	You understand?	Did they catch...?	Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
Did the leads come in yet?	No.	Oh, God, I hate this job.	I'll be at the restaurant. </pre> </html>
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?	Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
Shelly, the Machine, Levene.	You...	That's great.	Thank you, George.
Wh...wh...Wha...?	We had a robbery.
...how can you talk to me that... that...	Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.	I didn't rob...
Who used to say that?	In school.
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...	I'm sure that we're insured, George...
I don't know, George, why?	'Cause, you know, 'cause they weren't, I know that Mitch and Murray uh...
What?	That they're going to be upset.	That's right.  You want to go out today...?
Shelly: get in the office.	"I didn't...why should I...""Where were you last..."" Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?"
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...	Go to lunch, will you...	I want to work today, that's why I came...	The leads come in, I'll let...	...that's why I came in.  I thought I...	Just go to lunch.	I don't want to go to lunch.	Go to lunch, George.	Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...	Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...	That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...	Excuse me...
"I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to...""Call an attorney,"" that means you're guilt... you're under sus...""Co...,"" he says, ""cooperate"" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've..."	Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch?
Mmm.	Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?	Excuse me, sir...	Did they get my contracts?
Excuse me, fella.	...did they...	Would you excuse us, please...?	Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK FUCK FUCK!  WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!!  OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...	Who are you?
Who told you...?	Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.	Moss...Who told him?	How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.	Would you excuse us, please.
Fuck insured.  You owe me a car.	Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?	Are you talking to me?
Aaronow...	They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts...
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.	Levene!	Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.	Levene!!
Roma!  I'm talking to you...	I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.	You have a problem?	Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...	I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.	The people downtown said...	You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?	Could I...	I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...	Hey, fella, let's get this done...	Anyone in this office lives on their wits...  I'm going to be with you in a second.  What you're hired for is to help us--does that seem clear to you?
Mr. Levene...?	You're done, come down, and let's...	Would you come in here, please?	And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.	I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
"Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the ""Machine."" That is Shelly ""The Machine"" Lev..."	Get in the goddamn room.
John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...	Shelly, you blew the last...	"No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't ""blow"" them.  No.  I didn't ""blow"" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed..."	...you didn't close...	...I, if you'd listen to me. Please.  I closed the cocksucker. His ex, John, his ex, I didn't know he was married...he, the judge invalidated the...
Shelly...	...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.	What about the other two?	What two?	Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...	...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...	...no...	...do you want to go downtown...?	...no...	...then...	...I only...	"...then what is this ""you say"" shit, what is that?  What is that...?"	All that I'm saying...
"What is this ""you say""?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?"	Roma.	Under him?	Moss.	Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...	Not lately it isn't.	"Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, ""You bought that for me Shelly."" Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was ""luck""?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?"	It isn't me...
...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...	...after the thirtieth...	Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.	Murray...	...you talk to Murray...	I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...	"Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's ""talk,"" my friend, that's ""talk."" Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked."	You're saying that I'm fucked.	Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.	Let me...
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...	...let me...are you listening to me...?	Yes.	Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.	Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...	You know what those leads cost?	The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...	Murray said...	"Fuck him.  Fuck Murray.  John?  You know?  You tell him I said so. What does he fucking know?  He's going to have a ""sales"" contest...you know what our sales contest used to be?"
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...	Murray said...	John.  John...	Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...	...ah, fuck this...	The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...	That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.	Either way.  You're out.	I'm out.	Yes.	I'll tell you why I'm out.  I'm out, you're giving me toilet paper. John.
I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per...	...they kicked out.	They all kick out.  You run in streaks, pal.  Streaks.  I'm... I'm...don't look at the board, look at me.  Shelly Levene.  Anyone. Ask them on Western.  Ask Getz at Homestead.  Go ask Jerry Graff. You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT. I got to get on the fucking board. Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who ever picked up a check I was flush. Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch himself...Those guys lived on the business I brought in.  They lived on it...and so did Murray, John. You were here you'd of benefited from it too.  And now I'm saying this.  Do I want charity?  Do I want pity?  I want sits.  I want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  Give me a lead hotter than that, I'll go in and close it.  Give me a chance. That's all I want.  I'm going to get up on that fucking board and all I want is a chance.  It's a streak and I'm going to turn it around.  I need your help.
Why?	The leads are assigned randomly...	Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?	...apart from the top men on the contest board.	Then put me on the board.	You start closing again, you'll be on the board.	"I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a ""test,"" alright?  As a ""test"" and I promise you..."	I can't do it, Shel.
Of what?	And what if you don't close.	I will close.	What if you don't close...?
I will close.	What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.	I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...	Not lately you can't...	Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.	Twenty percent.
Alright.	And fifty bucks a lead.	"John.  Listen.  I want to talk to you. Permit me to do this a second.  I'm older than you.  A man acquires a reputation.  On the street.  What he does when he's up, what he does otherwise...I said ""ten,"" you said ""no."" You said ""twenty."" I said ""fine,"" I'm not going to fuck with you, how can I beat that, you tell me?...Okay.  Okay.  We'll...Okay. Fine.  We'll...Alright, twenty percent, and fifty bucks a lead. That's fine.  For now.  That's fine. A month or two we'll talk.  A month from now.  Next month.  After the thirtieth.  We'll talk."
What are we going to say?	No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.	I'm not sure I have two.	I saw the board.  You've got four...	I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...	Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.	Alright.	Good.  Now we're talking.
Now?  Now?	Now.  Yes...When?
I wish I could.	You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.	Can't do it.	I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?	No.	I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...	I can't do it, Shelly...
"Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. ""Mur, this new kid burns my ass."" ""Shelly, he's out."" You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once..."	I have to go...
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.	I can't split them.
Why?	Because I say so.	Is that it?  Is that it?  You want to do business that way...?
You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?	You want something off the B list?	Yeah.  Yeah.
Is that what you're saying?	That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.	That's alright.	The deal still stands, our other thing.
What happened?	Somebody broke in.
Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!	The leads are coming.	Get 'em to me!	I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...	Did you tell 'em my sale?
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.	It's better than a good sale.  It's a...	Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...	All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.	The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.	What does that fucking mean?	That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.	"Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your ""end of month board..."" You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust..."	I were you, I'd calm down, Shelly.
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?	It's not impossible.	On an eighty-thousand dollar day? And it ain't even noon.
Mmm.	You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?	Yes.  I hear you.	You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.	Mmm.	Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
You are?	Yes, I am.	What are you trying to tell me?	What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.	Why I don't...	"You listen to me, someday you might say, ""Hey..."" No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your ""partner"" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone..."	Excuse me...	...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
How do you know I made it up?	What?	How do you know I made it up?	What are you talking about?	"You said, ""You don't make something up unless it's sure to help.""  How did you know that I made it up?"	What are you talking about?	I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.	Well, hadn't it?	No.  It hadn't.	Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?	You're so full of shit.	You robbed the office.	Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.	What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.	I don't know what you are saying.	If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.	I...
I sold them to Jerry Graff.	How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?	Five thousand.  I kept half.	Who kept the other half?
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.	That was easy, wasn't it?
It was his idea.	Was it?	I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.	Uh-huh?	He told me my share was twenty-five.	Mmm.
"Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, ""Do this, we'll get well..."" Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right."	I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
What?	You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one.
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!	No, I don't think so, Shel.	I...	No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.	I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.	What sales?
What sales...?  I just closed eighty-two grand...Are you fuckin'...I'm back...I'm back, this is only the beginning.	Only the beginning...	Abso...	Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...	I've got the check...	Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
The check's no good?	You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...	Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?	Call up the bank.  I called them.	You did?
Don't.	I'm sorry.	Why?	Because I don't like you.	John: John:...my daughter...	Fuck you.
You did that?	Eighty-two thousand dollars.
Those fuckin' deadbeats...	My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...	Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories...
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...	"""...you have to believe in yourself..."""	Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.	"""Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe in yourself..."""
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...	"""...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."""	Shit.	"""'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"""	And did they steal the contracts...?
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?	Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
"""You do get the...""  Huh?  Huh?"	Fuck is that supposed to mean?	"""You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."""	Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?
I got 'em in the kitchen.  I'm eating her crumb cake.	What does that mean?
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...	Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...?
Dave...	...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and put me on the board.  I'm going to Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac board, Williamson!  Pick up the fuckin' chalk.  Eight units. Mountain View...	You sold eight Mountain View?	You bet your ass.  Who wants to go to lunch?  Who wants to go to lunch? I'm buying.  Eighty-two fucking grand.  And twelve grand in commission.  John.  On fucking deadbeat magazine subscription leads.
Eight units?	That's right.	Shelly...!	Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...	They took the phones...	They...
When?	Last night, this morning.
They took the leads?	Mmm.
Just now.	Guess who?
Fuck you, Dave...	"""You have to believe in yourself... you""--look--""alright...?"""
Fuck you care...?	"""I want to tell you something, Harriet..."""
How was it...?	From the store.	Fuck her...	"""What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it."" And we sit there.  I got the pen out..."	"""Always be closing..."""	"That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. ""This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."""	Harriett...	"Bruce...""I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position?"
"The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..."" Listen to this, I actually said this. ""That's not the subject of our evening together."" Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. ""Now I want you to sign.""  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? ""My arm's getting tired?"" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it."	Like you taught me...	"Bullshit, you're...No.  That's raw... well, if I did, then I'm glad I did.  I, well.  I locked on them.  All on them, nothing on me. All my thoughts are on them.  I'm holding the last thought that I spoke: ""Now is the time.""  They signed, Ricky.  It was great. It was fucking great.  It was like they wilted all at once.  No gesture...nothing.  Like together."
You closed 'em today?	Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...	...yes...	...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.	That's right, Shel.
"And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of ""marshaling your sales force..."" What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you."	He's right, Williamson.
Oh, Christ.	The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...	"You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue ""Kenilworth."""	What is it?	Kenilw...
I own the property, my mother owns the property, I put her into it. I'm going to show you on the plats. You look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your time and if you still feel.	No, Mr. Roma.  I don't need the time, I've made a lot of investments in the last...
Glad to meet you.	I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...	No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?	Yes.	I wanted to speak with you about...	Well, we'll do that this weekend.	My wife told me to look into...	Beautiful.  Beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I want to tell you something.  You, Ray, you eat in a lot of restaurants.  I know you do...
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?	Sure.	Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?	Which...	"""Home Cooking""...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,"	Uh...	Home...	Home cooking...	The monthly interview...?	Oh!  For the magazine...	Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...	Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure.  Sure, go ahead, Ricky.
You're sure?	Go ahead.	Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?	No, his wife is.	Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?	Twelve-fifteen.	Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!	Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...	No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.	Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
What?	Kenilworth...?	I'm sorry...?	Kenilworth.	Oh, God...Oh, God...  Jim, excuse me...Ray, I told you, who he is is the senior vice- president American Express.  His family owns 32 per...Over the past years I've sold him...I can't tell you the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land.  I promised five weeks ago that I'd go to the wife's birthday party in Kenilworth tonight.  I have to go.  You understand. They treat me like a member of the family, so I have to go.
Rick...?	I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray.
Rick...?	I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.
Rick...	One moment, I'll be right with you.  In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which  I can't talk to you about here.
"I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, ""The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..."" You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?"	Me.	Yeah.	Mm.	Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?	I think I'd better stay here for a while.
Ricky, I...	Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...	Ricky...
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?	Did I...?	Yes.	I don't know.
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?	What do I...?	Yes.	Mmmm...	I don't know.  For me, I'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm.  Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. There was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me café au lait.  She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.  Eh?  What I'm saying, what is our life?  It's looking forward or it's looking back.  And that's our life. That's it.  Where is the moment?  And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss.  What else?  The bank closes.  We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? None on 'em.  We worry anyway. What does this mean?  I'm not secure.  How can I be secure?  Through amassing wealth beyond all measure?  No.  And what's beyond all measure?  That's a sickness. That's a trap.  There is no measure. Only greed.  How can we act?
Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?	Gimlet.	Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?	Lingk.  James Lingk.	James.  I'm glad to meet you.  I'm glad to meet you, James.  I want to show you something.  It might mean nothing to you...and it might not.
I've got to talk to you.	Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim Lingk, D. Ray Morton...
I've got to talk to you...	I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock.
It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no.  We'll go out to his home sometime.  Let's see.  Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?	My wife...
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.	It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
Monday.	She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...	Who did she call?	I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...	Why did she do that, Jim?
I don't know.  They said we have three days.  They said we have three days.	Three days.	To...you know.
No, I don't know.  Tell me.	To change our minds.	Of course you have three days.
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...	But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...	Three business days.  They mean three business days.	Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.	I don't understand.	That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
You don't count Saturday.	I'm not.	No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.	But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.	What would have elapsed?	If we wait till Mon...	When did you write the check?	Yest...	What was yesterday?	Tuesday.	And when was that check cashed?	I don't know.	What was the earliest it could have been cashed?
Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.	The check wasn't cashed?	I just called downtown, and it's on their desk.
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.	It's not me, it's my wife.	What is?	I told you.	Tell me again.
What's going on here?	Tell me again.  Your wife.	I told you.	You tell me again.	She wants her money back.	We're going to speak to her.	"No.  She told me ""right now."""	We'll speak to her, Jim...	She won't listen.
"No, no.  That's just something she ""said."" We don't have to do that."	She told me I have to.	No, Jim.	I do.  If I don't get my money back...
I'm...	Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.	I can't regotiate.	What does that mean?	That...
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...	I...	What...?	I...	What...?  Say the words.	I don't have the power.  I said it.	What power?	The power to negotiate.	To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?	This.	"What, ""this""?"
The deal.	"The ""deal,"" forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?"	I can't talk to you, you met my wife, I...
What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.	She told me not to talk to you.	Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.	She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...	Forget the deal, Jimmy.  Forget the deal...you know me.  The deal's dead.  Am I talking about the deal?  That's over.  Please. Let's talk about you.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on, Jim.  I want to tell you something.  Your life is your own.  You have a contract with your wife.  You have certain things you do jointly, you have a bond there...and there are other things.  Those things are yours.  You needn't feel ashamed, you needn't feel that you're being untrue...or that she would abandon you if she knew.  This is your life.  Yes.  Now I want to talk to you because you're obviously upset and that concerns me.  Now let's go. Right now.
What?	And the check is...	What did I tell you?  What did I say about the three days...?
What are the police doing?	It's nothing.	What are the police doing here...?
You cashed the check?	Not to my knowledge, no...
Fuckin' asshole.	What, they beat you with a rubber bat?	Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...	You going to turn State's?	Fuck you, Ricky.  I ain't going out today.  I'm going home.  I'm going home because nothing's accomplished here...Anyone talks to this guy is...
Guess what the Machine did?	Fuck the Machine.	Mountain View.  Eight units.	Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...	You hear what I said?	Yeah.  He closed a deal.	Eight units.  Mountain View.	You did that?
Fuck you.	Guess who?	When...
You just this morning...	Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
We haven't got a lead...	Why not?	They took 'em...
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.	You have a mean streak in you, Ricky, you know that...?
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.	"Who said ""Fuck the Machine""?"	"""Fuck the Machine""? ""Fuck the Machine""?  What is this.  Courtesy class...?  You're fucked, Rick--are you fucking nuts?  You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  You want to..."
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...	Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...	"Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. ""How much you just ingested,"" what a big man you are, ""Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum."
"I'll show you how to chew it."" Your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are..."	Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.	What is this, your farewell speech?	I'm going home.	Your farewell to the troops?	I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.	Have a good trip.	And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.	They didn't get my contracts.	They--excuse me...
They didn't get the contracts.	Did they...	They got, listen to me...	The...
Listen to me: They got some of them.	Some of them...
They took some of the con...	...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...	You closed him yesterday.	Yes.	It went down.  I filed it.	You did?	Yes.	Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.	I...
Where are you going?	To the restaura...what do you fucking...?	Aren't you going out today?	With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...	I have the stuff from last year's...	"Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your ""nostalgia"" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to..."
...you want to go out today...?	'Cause I don't have to eat this month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to me...  Fucking Mitch and Murray going to shit a br...what am I going to do all...
Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I going to make a living on thses deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get this, from the morgue?	If you don't want it, give it back.	"I don't ""want"" it, if you catch my drift."	I'm giving you three leads.  You...	What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...	The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...	Okay, okay, okay, gimme this shit. Fine.
Three?  I count two.	Three.	"Patel?  Fuck you.  Fuckin' Shiva handed him a million dollars, told him ""sign the deal,"" he wouldn't sign.  And Vishnu, too.  Into the bargain.  Fuck that, John.  You know your business, I know mine. Your business is being an asshole, and I find out whose fucking cousin you are, I'm going to go to him and figure out a way to have your ass... fuck you--I'll wait for the new leads."
Yes.	Mr. Lingk and I are going to...	Yes.  Please.  Please.  The police  can be...
We had a slight burglary last night.	It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...	Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...	John...	Your contract went out to the bank.
...Mr. Williamson...	Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
...I wouldn't worry about it.	Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.
Are you alright?	Yes.	Did you like your party?	I got lots of presents.	Do you like them?	I didn't know the people who gave them to me.	They were friends.
Did you see my present for you?	No, where is it?	On your pillow.	I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.	I know.  How long will you be gone?	Just a few days.	Will you take me?	I can't.	Why do you have to go?	To do business.	I can help you.	Some day you will.
You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.	I was taller than you when I was fourteen.	Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.	I'm not hungry.	Well, that's alright... alright. Good.  You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right?  You know... I never finished college.  I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;	That's right.	But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.	The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;	What position did you occupy?	At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.	We have no money for a rug.	No.  He would give it away.  I know how to repay a consideration.
Your friend lives in a fine building.	Oh yes, the very best.
They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.	If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.	What?  You read it in the papers?	This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone.
Who is the greatest man you can think of?	Go on, answer him when he talks to you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.
What took so long?	She couldn't decide.
Do you think he'd be satisfied with the two hundred dollars?  I think he would.	That scar-faced bastard will find out what we got from the wholesaler. He won't take a dime less than three hundred dollars.	What if we don't pay?	You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?	What can we do?
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.	He's going to kill Fanucci.	Then, after that, what?  Joe 'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla himself, c'mon!
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.	I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?	Yes, thank you.	How are the kids?	Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.	I got surprises for everybody!	Bought at the airport.	This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.	You go see your children first, and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.	Connie.	Merle, have you met my sister-in- law Deanna?
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.	I saw him with you.	We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.	Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.	Michael...	You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.	You're not my father!	Then why do you come to me?	Because I need MONEY!	Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.	It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
Is Kay coming?	No.	Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.	Tom is right.	Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?
I want to talk to you, Michael.	The children can stay.	I hated you for so long, Michael; for so many years.  I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you would know -- and you would be hurt too.  But I understand you now; I think I do.  You were being strong for all of us, like Papa was.  And I forgive you, and want to be close to you now.  Can't you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet, and helpless without you.
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.	I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.	Yeah, but I don't want him to see you.
Goddamn bitch.	Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.	I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?	He's the head of the family.
What's 'cent' Anne?'	A hundred years...it's a toast.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?	Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.	Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!	Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!	These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
Deanna, will you get back into the house!	I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
I don't want to stay here...	Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
Would you like some?	No, Dad.	Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?	It's not talk; I'm doing it.	You would risk your life for strangers?	Not for strangers; for my country.	Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.	That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.	I know.  I know, Michael.  It's Christmas, your brothers and sister are all here -- we are happy. Let's not spoil this.  Go your own way, but when you are ready, come to me the way a son should.  I have hopes for you...
Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks.	I'm not afraid of his words.	He is weak.	He will grow strong.	The child cannot harm you.	He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
Otherwise the police will come to see you and your wife and children will be dishonored and destitute. Of course, if my information as to your gains is incorrect, I'll dip my beak just a little.  Just a little, but no less than one hundred dollars, and don't try to deceive me, eh paisan?	My two friends have my share of the money.  I'll have to speak to them after we deliver these to the wholesaler.	You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.	You must understand, this is all new to me...	I understand...	But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.	You're a good fellow.
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.	I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.	Ah, you're a sharp young fellow. How is it I've never noticed you before  You're too quiet for your own interest.  I could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable.  No hard feelings, eh?  If I can ever do you a service let me know. You've done a good job for yourself tonight.
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.	Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.	My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.	We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.	Yeah, some deal I made.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?	I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
Ready, Frankie.	Let's go.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.	Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.	You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...	We were all upset about that.	That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?	C'mon, I see what I can do.
Hey Mike, what can I say?	Forget it, just go take care of her.
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.	Mio fratello.
Oh, 'scuse me.	It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.	Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.	We're making an investment in Havana.	Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?	Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.	I never met them.	Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?	No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.	I want you to help me, Fredo.	That's what I'm here for.	Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.	Count on me; that's my specialty.	I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.	Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we'll have these Washington suckers right where you want 'em.  Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He always wanted to die in bed...with a broad.
Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.	I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.
Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.	No.	Wait'll you see!
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?	It was hard to have him killed.	You?  What do you mean you, I thought...	It was hard to have him killed.	You?  What do you mean you, I thought...	It was Frankie tried to have me hit.	No.  I mean, are you sure?	You know otherwise, Freddie?	Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything. Fellas!  You're all falling asleep. We got to see Superman.
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?	You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...	What's that?	The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?	Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.	Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.	Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.	Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.	...Who?	The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.	But, you told me yourself...	It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.	What do you want me to do?	To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.	What is it?  Can I help?	The old man will never bring in the New Year.
Fredo.  Where are you going?	Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.	We have time.	I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.	What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?	I know they get Pentangeli, that's all I know.
I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.	And you believed that story.	He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.	I've always taken care of you.	Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!	It's the way Pop wanted it.	It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.	There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?	The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.	You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.  Do you understand?
I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.	He's an Italian?	A pig of a Neaponitan.
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?	Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?	Beautiful.	Beautiful.	For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!	I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
I bet you can't guess what happened?	What?	Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.	No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?	Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.	In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.	I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.	Why?	Because he's what we say... &quot;connected&quot;... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.	And he agreed?	He took the money.  Now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood, including Papa.
The 'patrone' is here.	Chi?	Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'
It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.	I'm supposed to stay in my house.	Within the compound will be fine.	I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.	That's off now.	I'm going to see my parents.	Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.	How long does this go on?	I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...	Am I a prisoner?	That's not the way we look at it.
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?	Kay... Kay...	What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.	You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.	That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.	Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?	He's not the same as when I met him.	If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.	What the hell does that mean?  Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life.  I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.	When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.	I don't know.  I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
Where's my wife?	With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.	We don't know that's true, he never said that.	I can feel it in the way he talks to me.
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.	Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.	It's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when I was Consigliere to Sonny.
Hello?	She's gone, Tom.
What do you mean gone?	The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.	Why didn't someone tell me!	I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
You're going to talk to him now.	Yes.	Will you tell him?	I don't know.
Rocco!	I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.	Goddamn it, where were you?	I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.	I can't let him down.
Me too, Tom?	Yeah, give me a minute.
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.	Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.	Connie's outside.
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?	Sure, Mikey.
If you need anything, just...	Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.	But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...	No, I have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and Tom, you are my brother.
Mikey, I hoped...	No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.	Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?	I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.	But if you're wrong...	If I'm wrong...
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?	No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?	I took care of it.	What was it, so I'll know.	A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
Where's my brother?	Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.	I asked about Fredo?	The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.	I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.	My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.	They can come in now.	Wait... there's something else.	Alright.
Go on, tell me.	Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
Was it a boy or a girl?	Mike, at three and a half...	What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!	It was a boy.	And Kay...she's all right?	She took the Senate Investigation worse.	Does she blame it on me?  The baby?	I don't know.
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?	Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him.  Roth played this one beautifully.	Alright.  I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.
Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?	I know he's in Israel.
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.	His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;	He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.	That plane goes to Miami...	I want it met.	Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.	I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...	Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.	I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?	Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?	They are everywhere!	I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.	I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.	Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.	Good.  Then you're staying.	I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.
Fifteen percent skim?	Twenty-five this time.
It might show.	Mike wants it.
We've never sent this much with one courier.	Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
What's up?	No questions.	I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.	Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.	How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.	He's going to try Panama...
I think I prefer to see my client privately.	The room has a bug in it.	I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.	Did my brother go back?	Yeah, but don't worry.	He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.	Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.	That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.	You're right.	Tom, what do I do now?
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.	Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.	You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.	Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.	Yeah, it was once.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.	Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.	Yeah, that was a good break.  A nice deal.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.	Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
...and the tape will be running.	Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
What the hell are you talking about?	We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.	No strings.	You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.	No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.	Do you gamble?	A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?	Do you owe markers?	Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.	Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.	You paid off thirty grand I never owed.	We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.	And what's the price of their not finding out.	Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.	Thanks...friend.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.	I don't think that's necessary.	Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.	Very well.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?	Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.	Is he related to the witness?	He is, I believe, a brother.
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.	The witness is excused; take him out.
Senator Kane.	This meeting is adjourned.	This committee owes an apology!	The committee is adjourned until further notice.
Yes.	I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.	I'm going to the market.	If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.	Whose orders are these?	Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.	This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.	I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?	Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
Kay.	Yes, Michael.
How's the baby?	Sleeping inside me.	Does it feel like a boy?	Yes, Michael, it does.	I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.	It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.	Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House.
I had no idea...	I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.	Where?	In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.	Why don't you sit down?	I'm not going to stay long; I can't.	There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.	I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.	Why too late?	Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?	His brother came to help him.	I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?	On a plane back to Sicily.	And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.	That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.	You would have killed his brother?	Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.	I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.	Kay, I told you...	Goodbye, Michael.	I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.	Michael.	No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!	Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?	If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.	At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.	We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.	You haven't heard me.
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.	The baby I lost...	I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.	It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
Are you Klingman?	Who's asking?	Where can we talk?	Right here.	I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.	Who do you think you're talking to?	You said you were Klingman.	You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.	You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.	Get out of my hotel.
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?	I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?	There are still things I have to do.	Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?	Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?	You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.	No, I meant lose his family.	Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?	But times are different...
Sit down, this is almost over.  You follow the baseball games?	Not for a few years.	I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.	Yes.	What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.	The incident of the other night is a nuisance that I can take care of. I came to you because I want nothing to affect our agreement; I wanted to clear everything I'm going to do with you, just in case.	You're a considerate young man.	You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.	However I can help you...	The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.	We do favors for each other...	Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
Nothing is more important.	Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?	It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.	Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.	Of course you must keep control of your family.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.	It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
Enjoy.	I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.	We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.	My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.	The money was sent.	Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.	I wouldn't consider anyone else.	Except the President of the United States.
If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible.	You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
This doubles my investment.	Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.	Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.	I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?	Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.	Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?	Why...the Rosato Brothers.	I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.	There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?	No, I'm fine.
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.	Very impressive.	Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike, I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he manages the casino for us.
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.	So?	So, that occurred to me.
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.	Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
I just left our friend in Miami.	How is his health?	Not good.	Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?	He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.	He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.	He always makes money for his partners.  One by one, our old friends are gone.  Death, natural or not, prison, deported.  Our friend in Miami is the only one left, because he always made money for his partners.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.	Let him gamble.	Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
Are you the son of Vito Corleone?	Yes.
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?	No.	This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?	I deny his every charge.	Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?	That is a complete falsehood.	Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?	That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?	I do not.	Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.	I do not.
I know.	When do we talk?	After dinner.
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.	We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.	Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.	You were unfair with them.	Says who?	Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.	Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.	They feel cheated.	Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.	Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!	And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.	Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.	The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.	I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.	How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.	No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.	You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.	Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.	He did business...but he never trusted him.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.	I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?	Michael, yes, we was all relieved...	In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
I want you to help me take my revenge.	Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?	I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.	I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.	I want you to settle on their terms.	Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.	Trust me; do as I ask.	It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?	Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?	Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.	I know.	Then why do you want me to lay down to them?	Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.	Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.	This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.	Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.	Good.
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.	I thought we would meet alone.	I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.	Some water.
The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.  But I have the idea from sources...  ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana.  In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality.  The license, which is now in Klingman's name.	Turnbull is a good man.	Let's forget the bullshit, I don't want to stay here any longer than I have to.  You can have the license for two hundred and fifty thousand in cash, plus a monthly fee equal to five percent of the gross...
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?	I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.	All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.	Keep them alive.
We'll try.	It's important.
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.	And?	No sign of them yet; but they're still on the Estate.
On the phone?	No, she's here.
Rosato, where's your brother?	Sitting right behind you.
He don't want to talk?	We worked it all out beforehand.	Are we going to eat or what?	Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.	Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.	You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?	We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.	You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.	Don't I look like I'm listening?	We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.	I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?	We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.	Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?	My lawyer went over this beforehand.	What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?	The same assurance we got from you.	What if I say shove it?	Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.	You want a war?	We got no choice.	You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.	We got friends in the commission.	I'm talking about Italians!	What about Michael Corleone?	He supports me.	Maybe, yes... maybe no.
What's this?	That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
I have already rented the apartment to another family.	I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.	I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.	How much more a month?	Eh...  Five dollars more.
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.	Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.	Yes.	What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat.  Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.	What was that?	In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!
I accept your generosity...	I won't keep you another minute...
Thanks, doll.	I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.	Why is everybody giving me crap tonight?
What makes you say that?	Just thinking out loud.	Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.	All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.	Fuck you.	Not anymore you don't.  Doll.	We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that!  We are watching my fucking movie.
This looks corny.	Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.	Maybe it's supposed to be funny.	Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them.
So what did you think?	Weird.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.	What's to be jealous of?	I've gotten to know someone who's famous.	Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.	If he were that famous, he probably wouldn't give me the time of day. This way, he's like <u>my</u> famous person.  Yeah, my own personal famous person.  Who treats me like I'm somebody worth talking to.
What's that mean?	It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.	I wasn't going to try anything.	Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.	Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?	It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.	It never crossed your mind?	He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.	All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.	Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.	It still hurt.  A lot.	I didn't mean to...	No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.	You liked it too.	Sure.  I loved it.	If you enjoy it, you should do it.	You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --	You mean us?
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.	I'm not a kid.	What are you then?  What will you be ten years from now?  Still cutting lawns?  Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
I like my life.  I'm a free man.	Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?	Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?	Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing games.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --	The Master is waiting for you.
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.	I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.	What're you talking about?	What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?	Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?	You will not hurt him?	Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?	No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.	You do that.
Something I can do for you?	The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.	Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.	Expect nothing fancy.
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.	Tea is fine.
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.	That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?	Long enough.  Fifteen years.	I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?	No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?	You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.	Your wife?	I'm not married.	Why?	Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?	A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.	You proposing what I think you're proposing?  Don't you think I'm a little young for you?
You ever been married, Hanna?	Of course.  I am married still.	Yeah?  What's your husband do?	He is dead now, twenty years.	Then you're as single as I am.	No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.	You're sure of that?	This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.	Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.	No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.	A homo?	Yes!  You know?
That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge.	You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.	You did not know?	Well...no, not really --	You and he are not doing things?	No!	Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.	I'm not going to hurt anyone.	Yes.  I trust you.
It's not what you think.	I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.	I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.	There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.	Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?	I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?	What do I do?	Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.	It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
What have you done with him?	I put him to bed.  He's not there?
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.	Oh, Mr. Jimmy.	He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.	He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.	But I didn't do this!	The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.	We have his note.	Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.	But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?	You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back.
Good morning.	Mornin'.	My name is Whale.  This is my house.	Nice place.	And your name is --?	Boone.  Clayton Boone.	I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?	Just that I was in the Marines.	The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.	Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?	Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me.	I stink to high heaven right now.	The honest sweat of one's brow.  I assure you I won't be offended. Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for two.
Or would you prefer a beer?	No.  Iced tea's fine.	Splendid.
These are your paintings?	What?  Oh yes.	Excuse me, but -- are you famous?	You know what they say.  If you have to ask --	I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.	They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.	They're just copies then.  Gotcha.	But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?	Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?	In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.	Yeah?  What were some of your movies?	"This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the ""Frankenstein"" pictures."	Really?
"""Frankenstein"" and ""Bride of"" and ""Son of"" and all the rest?"	I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.	Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.	Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.	What did she mean by going flooey?	I returned recently from a stay in hospital.	What was wrong?	Nothing serious.  A touch of stroke.
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.	Huh?	To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?	You mean, like posed for pictures?	Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.	What's to sketch?	You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.	Broke is more like it.	But expressively broken.  How did it happen?	Football in college.	You went to university?	Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.	Yes.  You were a Marine.
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.	You mean -- you really want to draw me?	Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.	But why?	Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.	And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?	What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.	You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?	I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that.
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.	Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.	You don't say?  Which picture?	"""Bride of Frankenstein."""	"Hmmm.  I much prefer ""Show Boat"" or ""The Invisible Man.""  Shall we begin?"
That shirt, Mr. Boone.	It's new.	I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?	I'm not wearing an undershirt.	Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.	But it's just my face you want to draw.	Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable...  Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?	All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
Take a picture, it lasts longer.	That's exactly what I intend to do.
Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.	No.  I'm fine.	It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it?  You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you.
Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.	Sounds like something you feed the dog.	It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.	Your family ate dripping?	Of course not.  As I said, only poor people --
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.	What?	I've spent most of my life outrunning my past.  Now it's flooding all over me.
There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?	We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.	No, you were middle class, like all Americans.	I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.	In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.	I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.	All right, I guess.	I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.
Do you mind?	Go ahead.
Is this David's doing?	This David's a friend?	Yes.  An old, useless friend.  You must excuse me, Mr. Boone.  This is a world I finished with long ago. I pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment.  Lunch should be ready.  Shall we?
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.	Did you now?	I liked it.  We all did.	Did anyone laugh?	No.	Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.	Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?	Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
Did you kill anyone?	I don't like to talk about that.	It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.	Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.	Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?	No.  I could have, though.	Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?	Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.	What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?	Can't today.	I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.	Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.	All righty.  I understand.
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.	You ever been married, Mr. Whale?	No.  At least not in the legal sense.
So you had a wife?	Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years.
Does that surprise you?	No, I -- you're a homosexual.	Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.	I'm not, you know.	I never thought you were.	You don't think of me that way, do you?	What way might that be?	You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.	Don't be ridiculous.  I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type.
So we understand each other?	What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.	I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?	No.  I --
Can I see what you did so far?	It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.	Sorry.  Not today.	But we have to match the other sketch.	I just feel more comfortable keeping it on.  You just said you didn't want me self-conscious.
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.	I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.	Suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders? Two buttons.  Is that so much to ask?  Just two little buttons.
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.	Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?	Not at the moment.	Why not?	You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.	Very well put.	The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.	Ah.  A philosopher.	Thoreau with a lawnmower.	I like that.  But take care, Mr. Boone.  Freedom is a drug, much like any other.  Too much can be a very bad thing.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?	In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
"You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done ""Show Boat."" Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  ""The Road Back.""  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece."	What happened?	The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed.
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?	Do you miss it?	It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years --
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.	You've done a helluva lot more than most people.	Better work.
"But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely ""the friend.""  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer."	How long were you...?	Twenty years.  Too long.  We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. So I finally decided to close down the show.
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --	Cut it out!
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?	I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --	From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it.  Understand?
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?	You first.	Oh no.  I never swim.
Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.	I'd like to sit for you again.  But only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  Okay?
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?	I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.	Everybody has stories to tell.	Not me.	What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.	I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?	Not fear.  More like disgust.	Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?	There's no people like you in my crowd.	No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?	You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.	Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.	You're talking through your hat now.	Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.	You were a soldier?	I was an officer.
This was World War I?	No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had --
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.	Something happened to him?
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.	I didn't --	Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.	You're the one who started it.	You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?	You asked me to model.  Remember?	Of course I remember.  Do you think I'm so senile --
Just go.  Please.  Why don't you go?	I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?	I want -- I want...
My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you.	No harm done.	It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.	You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.	I'm game.  Sure.	Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?	Clayton is fine.
Good afternoon, Clayton.	Do I look okay?
I suppose you'd like the top down.	If that's okay?	Nothing would please me more.
What did I tell you?  Listen.	I don't hear anything.	Exactly.  Cukor was too cheap to hire music.  There's nothing but chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag.
What was that about?	Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
Who's that?	David.  The friend I thought was in New York.	No.  The girl.	Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
Is that really her?	David produced her last picture.
Are you enjoying yourself?	Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.	Neither of us really belongs here.	Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.	Monsters?  The only monsters...  ...are here.
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?	Run for what?	Can't you see?  It's raining!
Let's get out of this funk hole	You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.	We're not sugar.  We won't melt.
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.	Catch my death.
It's not like her.	Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.	Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?	Good.  Let's get dry.
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?	Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?	I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.  I believe I promised you some clothes.
You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.	No.  Definitely not.
That only leaves the rest.	You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?	Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.	Do I have any other choice?	Very sporting of you, Clayton.
Is that --?	The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?	I thought you'd given up on my picture.	I'd like to try again.  If you're game.	Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?	Never gave it much thought.	Come now.  I'm sure you came across such situations in Korea.  A wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy?  Someone for whom death would be a blessing.
I never made it to Korea.	But you said --	-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.	I see.
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.	The Great War?	By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.	A very lucky thing indeed.	That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.	Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?	I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.	What happened?	I didn't have the guts for it.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.	I'm very sorry.	Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.	That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
Do you mind?	Not at all.
Storm's getting worse.	"""A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."""	"That's from your movie, right? ""The only monsters are here."""	I don't remember that one.	James Whale.  This afternoon at the party.
"I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, ""The only monsters are here.""  I was wondering which here you meant."	I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.	But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.	Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.	You're planning a trip?
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.	Your friend?
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?	You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.	Oh no, my friend.  It's digging itself up.  There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.  All my diversions have abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading. Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone to me now.
So it is going to happen after all.	What'd you say?
No.  It won't do.	What won't do?	You are much too human.	What did you expect?  Bronze?	Don't move.
Why?	For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.	I don't know.	Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.	It's from the first World War, isn't it?	There are straps in back.
All right.  Let's take it off now.	What was that?	It's too tight.
Just take off the fucking mask!	Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.	Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?	I haven't done a damn thing with you!	Oh, but you have.  You undressed for me.  I kissed you.  I even touched your prick.  How will you be able to live with yourself?
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.	You're crazy.
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!	No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
You okay?	Oh Clayton.	Did I hurt you?	Nothing I didn't deserve.	Need some help?	Pray you, undo this button.
I can undress myself, thank you.	All right.
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --	You'll feel better tomorrow.	Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.	Fuck off!	You told me to get you up, asshole.
I'm up.  Thanks.	Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers.	You ever hear of this Whale fellow?
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.	Ooooh.
You coming, Boone?	I think I'll hang around.
Hey, Boone.	Have a drink?
Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.	If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?	I told you.  I don't turn on the TV except for the fights.
Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it.	Good.  Fine.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.	I just want to watch it, okay?
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.	The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that?
Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.	I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
Where's Betty?	She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.	It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --	Then take the pills.	I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --	"""The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."""	You remember how a production eats up one's life.	Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
By the way, I like the Renoir.	Thank you.	Goodbye, Hanna.
What are you doing here?	Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.	I was, until last night.  Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
Should you be drinking in your condition?	Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.	You didn't, Jimmy.	I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.	You only embarrass yourself.	Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?	You know what I mean.  Your reputation.	But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.	Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?	No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
I didn't ask George to invite you.	Then who did?	Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?	Yes.  Perfectly.	All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.	Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?	That's what I'm trying to explain.
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.	You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?	That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.	But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?	In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.	So what do I do?	Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.	You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.	Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.	Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.	In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.	I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.	More your line.	My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin.  Dogs are so much more dependable than men.
Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?	Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.	Boris?  Do I look a fright?
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.	Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
Jimmy.  How are you?	Elsa?
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.	Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.	We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.	But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.	Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --	I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.	Of course.	What's our pesky friend up to now?
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.	Oh dear.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.	Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?	Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?	Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.	Don't be daft.  It's just a student from the university.
Mr. Kay, sir.	Yes?
Which ones?  I bring them all.	Luminal.
You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.	I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.	Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him.	Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.	No.  Let me lie here.  Thank you.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?	My mind's lovely.  And yours?
You remember what the doctor tells us.	Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.	I am not forgetting your last brief chat.	Just go.  We can manage without you.
He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.	Go.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?	Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
He is not going to kill the old man?	No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
She is horrible.	She is beautiful.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?	I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.	Good night.
Does the yardman come today?	Of course.  This afternoon.
Who was that at the door?	A visitor.
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.	I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.	No.  But someone you can talk to.
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?	I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.	Of course.  How is the old boy these days?
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...	It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.	I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.	No.  I do not cook for them.  My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food.
Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.	No.  I expect you can't.	And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.	One likes to live simply.	I know.  People's movies aren't their lives.
"That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  ""Bride of Frankenstein."""	Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?	Sure.	After you then.
This is the studio where I paint.	Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?	Everything.  Start at the beginning.	I was born outside London, the only son of a minister who was a master at Harrow.  Grandfather was a bishop.  Church of...Church of Eng...
Yes?	Your father was a schoolmaster?	Of course.  I attended Eton -- it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught.  I was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it.  The Great War, you know.  You had a Good War, but we had a great one.
"There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called ""Journey's End"".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  ""Journey's End"" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned."	"How much longer before we get to ""Frankenstein""?"	Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?	Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --	Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.	But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.	No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?	I don't mind.	Let's make it more interesting.  I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
That's funny, Mr. Whale.	It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?	You're serious.	Quite.	Then the rumors are true?	What rumors might those be?	That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.	A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.	You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
"George Cukor?  Who made ""A Star Is Born""?  I never guessed."	Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.	I guess.
Can we talk about the horror movies now?	Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?	"Will you tell me everything you remember about making ""Frankenstein""?"
Can that count as one question?	Of course.	I can't believe I'm doing this.
Just like going swimming, isn't it?	Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.	"Okay.  ""Frankenstein.""  Tell me everything."	Righto.  Let me see.
Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one.	Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?	My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.	He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.	You think so?  That's very kind --
Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?	I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.
Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?	Head.  Not heart.
I was going to take a swim.	I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.	Right.
Mr....Kay?	Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.	You didn't?	I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.	You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?	I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.	I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.	Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.	My monsters?	Don't go away.
How are you?	Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?	Splendid.  Now that I know you're around.
Can we get together while I'm in town?  I so badly want to sit for you again.	Sit?	I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session.  Those old snaps look rather dowdy now.
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?	Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.	I am such a goose.  I mistook you for Cecil Beaton.  It's the hat. You're wearing one of Cecil's hats, you know.
How's the leg?	Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
What are you doing here?	Is there someplace we can talk?
What about?	About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
It's been a long time, Memphis --	Six years ...	Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...	Tell me about Kip -
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...	What kind of job... ?	A boost. A big boost ...	A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
It seems she neglected to mention it	Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -	Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...	The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
Who was the job for?	Who do you think?
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...	Jesus ...	The business has changed...
What's with the fish thing -- ?	We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...	Fish.	And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.	"Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of ""Karaoke."""	I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...	You have a Hollandaise sauce ?	I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?	Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce	No, but you dress like an asshole ...
I think about that night a lot...	Me, too. Every time I walk...	How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ...
Yeah -- ?	Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?	"My version of ""take this job and shove it..."""	Are you crazy? You throw down with The Carpenter? You got a grudge against your life?
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?	Point-five ...
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?	How ya doing?
It's about my brother ... Kip...	Yes ... Kip ...
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.	I don't want him hurt...
My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...	I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...	Grow up. You don't kill people like me. People like me die in their sleep at 87 ... Do you know why? Because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California ...
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...	Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
They gave you only four days?	They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
I'm not interested --	I knew you'd say that.	I'm just here about my brother.	I knew you'd say that, too --
Sound it out for me.	Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...	And if he doesn't make it -- ?
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...	"""don't want"" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things..."
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?	Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...	Look at this. A multi-generational gathering of scumbags ...
Get out of here, Ray --	One more night --	Get out --	I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...	This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?	Right there -
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...	But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...	I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...
Well, that certainly won't do.	What do you mean -- ?	Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...	You got no choice. It's over.	Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ...
Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...	By the time you get out, asshole, there won't even be cars. We'll all be cruisin' around in space ships ...
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...	How is he?	He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...
Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.	What for?	You spend enough time down a man's throat, you get to know his tonsils. Do it ...
I know you --	You know my back -	You want to come along quiet?	How's Atley -- ?	Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --	Let them go --	How's that?	Let them go. And I'll leave ...	You'll leave -- ?	You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...	I don't golf...
You have my word...	Get out of here, then. Now.
I know you.	You know my back.
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...	A little family emergency --	I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...	No...	Or your baby brother. What was his name?	Kip.	Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ...
And this has what to do with me?	I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
I know you.	You know my back.	What are you still doing here, Randall?	Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?	Something like that -
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...	I don't think so, Detective ...
I'm on the move -	Your girl works in there ...	Not my girl anymore	Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...	What do you want from me?	Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
I know you.	You know my back.
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...	Consider me gone, Detective --	I'll catch you later, Randall --	Double-meaning intended --	You betcha --
Who is it -- ?	Castlebeck.
What's this -- ?	Cadillac.
What's wrong with it -- ?	Needs brightening ...
No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?	Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...	Double-meaning intended, right?	Right ...
When'd you get to town, Raines?	The other day....	What for?	No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...	Where you been, anyway?	Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...	You seem a little hinked-up ...	Not at all ...
How'd it go?	Keys were in it ...	Well, that defies the point, don't it?
It just ain't happening --	You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -	What's that?
I guess ...	You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.	okay ...	It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?	Got it ...	Good.
Diane 1.	Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?	Yeah.	That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
What's the matter?	It's all microchips and shit ...	Yeah?
"So? Tell me: how come they call you ""Freb"" anyways -- ?"	C'mon, man ...	We're partners here --
You ever feel bad about any of this?	Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...	You mean the poor --	No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
Donny --	Donny-nothin'!
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --	Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?
Lookit Kip. All grown up...	Hey, Donny --
You guys have any skills at all?	Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
What about him?	Freb can order pizzas like nobody's business
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...	Peugot convertible ...	What color?	Gray.
No. That was Higgins ....	Jonathan Quayle Higgins ...
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...	How you doing, man?	All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?	You know where the others are?
Forget that ...	Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
Most of 'em are late-model...	That's right. Only 10 exotics ...	We'll have to start beating the bushes, find out where they live...
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?	I know. Weird, huh -- ?
"Eleanor is Memphis' ""unicorn."""	And there she is --
How's it going -- ?	It's arright ...
I miss Orville Redenbacher already --	Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..	Dignity...	Yeah...
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...	There's no one left ...	We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ...
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.	one minute -- !
Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...	That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..	That's a good one, Donny...	I think so too --
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --	He didn't mess up. There it is ...
How are we supposed to--	Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
Any word, Kip -- ?	No ... And they won't take my calls ...	What does that mean -- ?	"It ain't what you'd call a ""good sign"""
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving	We don't -- ?
How you know that?	Remember who my brother is?
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?	Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
You look good...	You, too, Ma...	What are you doing back?	How's Kip?
Have you seen him?	No.	oh.	Atley Jackson came to see me ...	Atley Jackson. How is that one? How's the leg... ?
Why didn't you tell me?	I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?	He's in some trouble ...	I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...	You getting my checks ... ?	Of course ...
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...	Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...	What time of year?	Tuesdays ...
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?	Every day. I wonder about that every day...	Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership...  Imagine us selling cars?
And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...	Mother -- !
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...	You remember that, Kip?
I know...	We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?	I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.	Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?	NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...	Oh, for God's sake	I know, sir ...
Breakfast brunch -- ?	Yes, sir -
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...	You've been pre-booked...
Any more, O -- ?	You guys are through...	Whatcha got left ... ?	"""Carol."" A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ..."	We'll take it...	It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...	We'll take it.
Hey, Kip, what's up?	What do you say, Toby?,	I'm cool -
You goin' home?	Yeah... You want a ride...	Sure -	How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?	Hell, no. I boosted a 'Vette.	You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?	I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...	Damn crooks is everywhere --
It looks just like a regular Mustang --	Don't go there, Toby --
Any more ...	I dunno ...
No...	What am I supposed to do?
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...	Just hold on... Hold on ...
Hey, Kip ...	Hello, Memphis --
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -	You, too
Kip -- ?	Yeah ...	You all right -- ?	I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -	Just hold-on there --
This has nothing to do with any of that --	Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?	All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...	Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
You okay -- ?	Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?	Sure --
You sure you're okay -- ?	Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
Cool. So you're living up North?	Yeah -	I heard you were pumping gas -	Something like that -	You're kind of cultivating a new look.	Yeah --
Nah. It's a scratch.	Okay --
Hey, you want something to eat ?	What do you got ... ?
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -	Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
So what are you gonna do?	About what?	"""About what?"""	About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...	I can see that -
What happened to you?	What?
You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...	"C'mon, man... My ""demise...""  Overreaction"	"""Over--""  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--"	Hey, now -	He's gonna kill you -- !	I can handle it --	You can handle it?	I can handle it --	You can handle it?	I can handle it --	You?	Me.	You?	Me...
You don't think so, huh?	Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
What are you doing here?	Otto called -
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean	I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...	You hear me?	I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...	"""Shadow games?"""	Shadow games ...	You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...	How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?	After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...	Thank-you ...	De nada ...
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?	The family that steals together, deals together...	Dad'd be proud --	Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...	What era was that -- ?	The era when crime didn't pay --	As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?	Price of doing business...	What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?	"It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say ""paper or plastic?"""
Having fun, Kip?	Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
You okay -- ?	I'm cool.
Too early to tell. Nervous?	Nah.	That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...	I dunno. Whatever will be will be...	That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ...
What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you?	I don't know. What -- ?
Come here --	What?	Come here -	What?	Come here -
I've missed you, man ...	I know. I've missed you, too
Toby...	I know ...	Toby...
What are you doing here?	I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...	Where'd you find this one?	"Ya gotta keep tabs on your ""Eleanors"", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --"	You boost her -- ?	Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.	Move over ...
You okay -- ?	I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?	Sure, man --	She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ...
You want me to buy her?	Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
Where you off to -- ?	Thought I'd go for a ride -
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...	No problem -
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...	Things are all leafy and suburban ...
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.	What for -- ?	I gotta get my tool --
Now what -- ?	Now, we go -
Shit ...	Run it...
What are we gonna do -- ?	Hospital.	We can't do that, dude --
He give you an advance -- ?	Hell, yeah. Ten larger man
You know of one -- ?	Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
Take it back, Freb --	Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --	Where we going -- ?	We're going shopping -- !
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.	For real?
How's it going?	It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ...
Call 911 -	Call 'em here -- ?	DO IT! NOW -- !
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --	What are you doing here?
What's with the look?	The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...	You look like you lost your sheep ...
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?	Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...	Buy you a drink?	Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
"""Mitch?"""	Mitch.	So I was replaced by Mitch?	No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
On account of Mitch?	On account of me.
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?	No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?	I left town. I didn't leave you.	A distinction worth noting ...	And here I am...	Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -	Kip's in trouble
What kind of trouble -- ?	Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.	And you got some Italians -- ?	Six or seven...	I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...	I understand -
What the hell are you doing -- ?	If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
"That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her ""Sway."""	Hey -
Hey.	What's wrong with her -- ?	The right side of the engine is running richer than the left. And the scope isn't showing shit... I dunno...
Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself	"She was the only ""Annie"" you could find?"	They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...	Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...
She's trouble --	I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
I go with you --	That what you want?	That's what I want ...	Okay.
You mentioned that in your letters	I always thought you'd follow me up.
We were good when you bailed, weren't we?	Very good...	Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.	No way ...	No ... ?	No ...
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!	Oh. Okay. Right.
Ready -- ?	Oh, yeah.
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?	No. Open her ...
What the hell's that -- ?	A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?	Deodorant.
So, you seeing anybody?	No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...	She was so great, why'd you leave her?	Her parole officer strongly recommended it ...
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?	I think so... They're just... So ...	I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good --
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...	Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?	I take out my slim-jim...	Oh, God...
Slip it in ...	You're going high-cheese, dude --	Unlock your button ...	"""Unlock my button"" ... ?"	The alarms go off ...	Woo-woo-wooooo!	I pop your hood; find your siren wires	They're factory alarms ... Easy to get around... For a man with... Skills...	"I do ... I cut ""em..."	Cut 'em...	Now... I'm in ...	Of course you are. You're a professional...	I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...	I bet you say that to all the girls...	With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...	Wrong preposition...	Hear you roar ...	What about The Club ... ?	Let me worry about The Club ...	No worries ...	I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up.
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...	And Tracy's on the move ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...	How is he -- ?	They got him to the hospital. He's stable ...
Where to -- ?	Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
You okay -- ?	Yeah ... You -- ?
What are you doing... ?	Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ?	I dunno. I know a place.
This time it's for real?	Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
What -- ?	Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...	She does have one thing you don't.	What's that?	Bench seats.
Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?	Hello, Otto ...	You remember Junie?	Of course. Hi, Junie --
Whatever do you mean?	The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?	What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to...
I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...	He's gotten involved --
You think it can be done?	Are you considering a comeback tour?	Tell me...	It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...	The hard part ...	"""A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..."" Nietzsche said that."	Is he still working here ?	The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -	I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...	And the moral of that story is -- ?	Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...
Some crew you got ...	If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
You need him...	No we don't -	I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...	His criminal career has officially come to a close ...	The conundrum still applies, of course. The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime. However. This cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be.
Okay, then... Otto?	In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
"Anyone? The significance of ""Robin 1"" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?"	Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...	Ten points for our fearless leader ... Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ?
Split it up. Any word on Donny?	He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.	What happened to Sway?	She left...
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...	I'll see you soon --
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...	Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up	Yeah, I'm cool ...
How old are you now, Toby?	Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.	"Who's ""Eleanor?"""	The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.	"Why do you call it ""Eleanor?"""	"All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say ""Eleanor lives at such and such... "" and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ..."
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...	So she flies -	She soars -
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.	So what's in there -- ?	"I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between ""FRIENDS"" and ""SEINFELD""..."
What about me?	You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...	How come ... ?	Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...	Come on. Kip, talk to the guy
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?	You sure I can't go with ya?
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...	No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
You know what you got here?	Not really -	There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?	Not really --	"You have any other answers besides ""not really""?"	Not --	Right. You want to test the voltage drop ... Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ... See what you got ... You understand -- ?
Uh ... Randall -- ?	Excuse me --
What do you want, shithead?	Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --	Why don't you leave him alone?	I known Kip longing than you, man ...	Oooh, ain't you the lucky duck --
What are you doing here, assface?	Checkin' it out
Which way's out, man -- ?	Shit all looks the same here --
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.	Look at Jeannie's kid.	What? What happened?	The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.	But he was always a bad kid, that one.	No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.	Billy, how are you?	Son of a bitch. Get over here.
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.	"Listen to him.  ""Watch the suit,"" he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big."	Don't go busting my balls. Okay?	Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.	No more shines, Billy.	Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn.
Tell him. It's okay.	What?
What did you hear about that thing?	What thing? The Brooklyn thing?	No. No. The guy from downtown.	The guy from near where Christie used to live?	No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.	Oh I Him.
I don't want any more of that Shit.	Wha?  Me?	Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.	Me? Why would I get into that shit?	I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.	Why would I get into that?
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?	Paulie. Why would I? I swear.	You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?	Nods.	And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.	Nods again.	Anybody!  You understand?	I understand.
I warned you a million times.	I've been all fucked up since I got out.	You think I didn't know what you were doing?	It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.	Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.	But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...	You thought I was some fucking jerk?	Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.	You treated me like shit.
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.	Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.	Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.	I couldn't wait to get away. I was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. When they were having coffee, I was asking for a check.
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.	Liar!
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.	She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.	Talk? To you? After what you did!	I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
What're you doing? What about the car?	He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
What do you do?	I'm in construction.	They don't feel like you're in construction.
Go inside. I'll be right there.	What are you gonna do?	Get inside!
My bag. My bag.	What bag?	The bag with the envelopes.	Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --	Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
I'm gonna need some money.	How much?
I don't care. Something's going on.	That again.
Henry.  Wake up.	What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.	The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?	Son of a bitch.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?	I'm just having my last few drinks.	I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.	Shit.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.	What are you talking about?	Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.	Jezuz Christ!	You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.	What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
Stop! Stop!	Let her carry this shit inside.
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?	It'll be okay.	He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
We've got to help each other.	Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.	It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.	I can't do it anymore.	Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.	I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.	Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.	I don't want to hear about her anymore.	Never.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.	With what?	Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.	But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.	Don't worry about it. You listening to me? Now, come on. We gotta go see Paulie.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.	She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.	Hello!  Hello!  Have a good flight?
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.	What did he say, exactly?	At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.	Paul will calm down. You'll see.
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.	Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
Then you're safer in here.	Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.	Who's gonna do that?	Just get me out.
So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.	Where's the stuff?	What are you talking about?	You know. The stuff I left.	I flushed it down the toilet.	You what?	What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.	Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.	They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.	Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?	Oh no! No!  Noooo!
What happened? You okay?	I got seared.	Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.	I got scared.
What about the schools?	Yeah. What about the kids' school?
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.	Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Keep 'em coming.	Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?	Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?	Paulie was just talking about him.	Well, we gotta dig him up again.	What?	The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.	It's been six months.	It's still better than letting somebody find him.	If Paulie finds out, we got problems.	Fuck Paulie. If Batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.	What lions? I'm not going near any lions.	We only have to shove'em over the moat.
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.	Jimmy.	We did it.  We did it.
Give'm a drink.	I gotta talk to you.	Have a drink first.
Oh yeah? Anything you say.	What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?	Don't worry about it.	There are cops all over the place.	So what?  Where are they gonna go?
Paulie's gonna make him?	Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
What'll I tell Fran?	Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
Watch this.	Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?	I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.	Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
You want the melon?	Nah.	I better call again.	Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.	Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.	He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.	I think you got a good shot at beating the case.	How?	It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.	Yeah.	He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.	Yeah.	I want you and Anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. Without him, they've got no case.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.	What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
It's a fait accompli?	Done.	And Jimmy's in it, right?	Will you stop.
I want to talk to Jimmy.	He heard.	But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.	Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
What happened to you?	I can't make any more deliveries.	Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?	My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.	You're some fucking jerk.
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :	I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
Where'd you find such creeps?	They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
You ready?	Yeah.	Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick.
You know what to do?	Yeah, yeah.	Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.	Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!	Just make sure you do it. You know what I mean?
I gotta go home.	What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.	I gotta go home and get my hat.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?	I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.	What could I do?  If she insisted, I had to drive her home for her goddamn hat.  I threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone.
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.	I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.	Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.	He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.	Tommy.  Come on. Relax.	Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.	There's a shovel at my mother's.
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.	Will you get the fuck out of here.	Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?	Tommy  ...
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!	No, no. It's okay.	Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.	No. It's okay. Just watch this. Watch it.
Stay there.	Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.	I hate to do dishes.	Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.	So do I.
Are you okay? What happened?	Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...	It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?	Okay?
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?	He's okay. They sobered him up.	Did he say what they're asking him about?	Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.	I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.	He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.	I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block.
The third store down.	Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.
He didn't call?	He's with his friends.	What kind of person doesn't call?	He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.	If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.	Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.	Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?	Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.	Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?	Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?	Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.	Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
We'll pack up everything and send it to you.	I got dry cleaning.	We'll pick it up.
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.	I don't want them left back.	They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.	That's important.
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?	But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.	You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.	But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.	You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.	But, Paulie, please.	Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.	Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.	What can I do? If I could do something, don't you think I would?
You want a partner?	Please?
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan?	Yeah.	Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home...	What? Come on!	I'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey, the fuckin guy loves animals, and this is the last person you'd want this to happen to.
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.	Oh shit.	Guy's tryin' to walk the line--but he can't even fuckin' stand up, and so my uncle's gonna spend a night in jail. Just then there's this fuckin' BOOM like fifty yards down the road. Some guy's car hit a tree.
No way! You're kiddin'!	No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything!
Who's she talking to?	That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.	Fuck you, you fat fuck.	Least I work for a livin'.  Why'd you get fired?
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!	Suck my cock!	Oh, Morgan!
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.	All right, then.	Watch what happens.
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.	Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
Chuckie, what the fuck happened?	Okay. He's driving along and this fuckin' cat jumps in front of his car, and so he hits this cat--
"Yeah, so he's like ""Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something""--"	--or a tail--
Stop brushin' me back!	Stop crowdin the plate!
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.	What are we gonna do up there?	I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.	Fuck you.
She's sharp as a marble.	"We're not goin'.  I don't even like ""Kelly's."""
She didn't do it again did she?	Jesus Christ. Not even close.
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?	No, and we got four of 'em.
What do we got?	I don't know yet.
Hey, thanks for comin' out.	Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
When's the arraignment?	Next week.
What'd you get? You get leniency?	Probation, counselin', few days a week.	You're fuckin' good.
Who'd you call?	No one. I didn't have the number.
I didn't get on Cathy last night.	Why not?	I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.	What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?	I was countin' on it.
Thanks, Chuck.	Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
How's the woman?	Gone.	What?	She went to Medical school in California.	Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...	Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.	Some shows are worth the price of admission, partner.
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?	Week after I'm twenty-one.	Are they hookin' you up with a job?	Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.	Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.	Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.	It's a way outta here.	What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.	Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.	Chuckie, what are you talkin'...	Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.	Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?	Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.	You don't know that.	Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs. But you know what the best part of my day is? The ten seconds before I knock on the door 'cause I let myself think I might get there, and you'd be gone. I'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there. You just left.
You and Morgan throw?	No, I had to talk him down.	Why didn't you yoke him?	Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down.
You're kiddin' me.	Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
Okay.	So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
What class?	Ah, history I think.	Oh...	Yah, it's not a bad school...
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.	See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.	I wanted to meet your brothers...
Hi.	How you doin'?	Good.
How'd you know where to find me?	You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
Oh, right.	This is your house, right?
I guess so.	What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.	Is this a bad time?	She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...	Okay.	Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--	You caught that, huh?	I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?	Well, I don't have no trousers on...
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.	I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
Is that true?	Yeah, it is.
--That isn't funny--	"--and he's like ""shit! Motherfucker!"" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--"
Jesus.	"And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' ""I'm sorry."" BANG, ""I'm sorry."" BANG!"
WILL!	And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
Yah, that is a nice ass.	You could put a pool in that backyard.
Fuck this, let's get something to eat...	What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?	Fuck her.
"Morgan, I'm not goin' to ""Kelly's Roast Beef"" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?"	"All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to ""Kelly's."" It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once."	She's not stupid.
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!	So why don't you give me my sandwhich?	"What do you mean ""your sandwhich?"" I bought it."	Yah, all right...	How much money you got?	I told you, I just got change.	Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.	Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?	I think you should establish a good line of credit.
Did she get my Double Burger?	NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
Come on, Will...	Shut up.	No, why didn't you fight him at the park if you wanted to? I'm not goin' now, I'm eatin' my snack. WILL  So don't go.
Morgan, Let's go.	I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.	Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.	What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!	"I told you ""no"" yesterday!"
Some other guy?	"Yeah, he was probably drunker than my Uncle, who fuckin' knows? So the cop goes ""Stay here"" And he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. So, my Uncle Marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. So he goes, ""Fuck it."" He gets in his car and drives home."	Holy shit.	"So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, ""Is there a problem?"" And the Statie's like ""I pulled you over and you took off."" And my Uncle's like ""I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids."" And Statie's like ""Let me get in your garage!"" So he's like ""All right, fine."" He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage."
Did your Uncle get arrested?	The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.	I'm Irish.
Chuck, let's go.	You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
What's up guys?	Why don't you beat off at your house?	I don't have a VCR at my house.
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.	Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.	Oh, Morgan.
What'd you say about me?	Shut the fuck up.
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.	You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.	Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?	Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car.
I'm not sure--	--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.	Retainer...	You want us to give you cash right now?	Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
I don't think I...Larry?	I have about seventy-three...	Will you take a check?	Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
What class did you say that was?	History.	How'd you like that course?	Good, it was all right.	"History? Just ""history?"" It must have been a survey course then."
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.	"Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to ""seize"" the opportunity to ask you a question."
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.	Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
All right, are we gonna have a problem?	There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?	Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--	Codebreaking.	That's one aspect of what we do.	Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.	"That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't ""why should you work for N.S.A."" it's ""why shouldn't you?"""	Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one.
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?	Seven.	And what do you see?	Somethin's in my room.	What is it?	It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
You're in a safe place, Will.	It's touching me.
Where is it touching you?	Down there.  And I'm nervous.	You don't have to be nervous, Will.
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...	With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--	--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--	Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
No, there's a limit.	The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
"--Maker builds ""K"" to the ""N."" N is three to the K times--"	--But--
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?	Yeah, can I help you?	I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.	No students work for me.	Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--	Which one's your building?	Building two.
Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.	No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.	Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.	Well, he didn't show up for work today...
Oh, I'm sorry.	What're you doing?	I'm sorry.
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.	Hey fuck you.	Well... I'll be speaking to your supervisor.
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.	Fuck do you want?	I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.	Really?	Yes. Under two conditions.	What're those?	That you meet with me twice a week--
If I agree to this, I walk right now?	That's right.	I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.	Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?	Of course.	Okay. How?	It's an integer proof.
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?	I think so.	I happen to know so.
What's that?	Half-red, half-black--	--that?--	--Half-red, half-black--	--That edge!	An integer.
Shall we start the, uh...	Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
Oh, for God's sake, Will.	Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.	I told you to cooperate with these people.	C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
Get out, Will.	Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.	That's enough.
No.	Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting.
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--	I don't know what it's called.	--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--	I'm pretty sure it's right.
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--	That's fine, but did you ever think--	It's right.  Take it home with you.	Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?	I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.	Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.	Then don't set up any more meetings.	I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.	--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.	The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.	--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.	Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
Well, I'm sorry.	So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
What are you smiling at?	It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
I can come back.	No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
Will.	Hey, how you doin'?	You know, you're no longer required to come here.	I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.	Sam called me. From Tri-tech. He says you start working for them next week.
Thank you.	I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.	Bullshit.
This job... Do it if it's what you really want.	I appreciate that.
Yes.	Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.	Thank you, Will. I'll do that.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?	Yes.	I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.	It's Saturday.	I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.	Find out what?	Who proved the theorem.
Good to meet you.	Pleasure to meet you.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.	Uh-oh.	Have you heard of Jonas Salk?	Yeah, cured polio.	You've heard of Albert Einstein?
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?	No. LAMBEAU Okay thank you, Timmy.	So who won the bet?	I did.
Sean.	Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
Hello.	The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
Good to see you.	Good to see you.	Is there someplace we can talk?
I didn't see you at the reunion.	I've been busy.	You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?	Since Nancy died.	I'm sorry, that damn conference--	I got your card.
I've been busy, Gerry. I got a full schedule.	This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.	Not much free time, Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan?
Yeah.	He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
And he mailed it to Hardy--	--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.	Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--	They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.	Why me?	I need someone with your kind of background.	My kind of background?	You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.	He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?	Five.
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?	Just meet with the boy once a week.	Can we do it at my office?	That would be fine.
I got it.	It's on the college.
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.	I'll be okay.	It's a poker game with this young man. Don't let him see what you've got.
Would you excuse us?	Tom.	You too, Gerry.
"What do you mean ""he didn't talk?"" You sat there for an hour?"	No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.	Why would he do that?	To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.	"Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the ""old neighborhood?"""	I won't talk first.
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?	Not at all.	Timmy this is Gerry, an old friend of mine. We went to college together.
You're here quite a bit, then.	I live right around the corner.	You moved?	I been here a couple years.
Seems like it's going well.	I think so.	Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?	We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.	Jobs doing what?	Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.	That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.	Sean, I really don't think you understand--	What don't I understand?
He married his cousin.	Who?	Einstein. Had two marriages, both train-wrecks. The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum--
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--	I do.	Well, you're the only one.
Just...take it easy, Gerry.	Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.	Maybe he doesn't care about that.
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--	Now wait a minute, Gerry--	--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--	--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.	Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.	Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.	That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you.
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--	Now wait a minute--	--And confuse him--	--Gerry--	--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--	Hold on!	--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.	I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!	Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.	"""Undermine?"""	He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--	He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--	What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--	Why do you think he does that, Gerry?	He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.	Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!	Oh, come on, Sean--	--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!	Oh, that's nice--	--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!	Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--	--I'm not angry at you--	--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.	--I don't have any anger at you--	Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.	That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!	--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--	--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!	That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.	I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!	He won't be a failure!	If you push him into something, if you ride him--	You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!	He's not you!
Hello, Sean.	Come in.	Sean...	Me too.
So I hear you're taking some time.	Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.	Where're you going?	I don't know. India maybe.	Why there?	Never been.
Do you know when you'll be back?	I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.	I got one of those too.	You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
How about one now?	Sounds good.
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?	I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.	About thirty million to one.	You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?	About thirty million to one.
I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.	What's the point?	What do you want to do?	There is somebody...	Who is he?	He was my roommate in college.
What should I do?	The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together.
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.	You guys are fuckin' sick.
I could go for a Whopper.	"Let's hit ""Kelly's."""
Well, she out did herself today...	I don't got a crush on her.
What happened?  You got fired, huh?	Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.	How fuckin' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job? How hard is it to push a fuckin' broom?
"There goes that fuckin' Barney right now, with his fuckin' ""skiin' trip."" We should'a kicked that dude's ass."	Hold up.
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?	Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
So, you finally got a job Morgan?	Had one, now I'm fucked again.	So what do you got, a fuckin' Hyundai engine under there? Can I make it back to my house?
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.	Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.	I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--	"--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for ""Mike"" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book."	"Yeah, I read your book. ""Mike"" had the same problems as ""Chad"" the stockbroker."	Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.	You're right. I know.	Will, your not getting off that easy.	No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.	Like what, Will?	I go places, I interact.	What places?	Certain, clubs.  Like, Paradise. It's not bad.
I might understand that.	Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?	What?	C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.	That's very presumptuous.	Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.	Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.	I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.	You're getting defensive, Will.	Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.	"Who is ""Danny Terrio?"""	"If you wanna hit ""Ramrod,"" take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like ""Inspector Cluseau."""
Well, I can see this is pointless...	You're getting defensive...Henry. And hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. Christ, set her free.
"Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a ""shrink kit"" that comes with all these volumes included?"	Have you read all these books, Will?	Probably not.	How about the ones on that shelf?
Yeah, I read those.	What did you think?	I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?	I did.	That must have taken you a long time.	Yeah, it did take me a long time.
"""A History of the United States, Volume I."" If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's ""A People's History of the United States."" That book will knock you on your ass."	"How about Noam Chomsky's ""Manufacturing Consent?"""	You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.	You think so?	Whatever blows your hair back.
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.	You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
Yes, I do.	Nautilus?	Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?	285.	Oh.
Yeah. Do you paint?	No.	Crayons?	This is a real piece of shit.	Tell me what you really think.	Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.	What does?	The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.	What is?	I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.	"Oh, ""Starry Night"" time, huh?"	"You ever heard the saying, ""any port in a storm?"""	"Sure, how 'bout ""still waters run deep""--"	--Well, maybe that means you.	Maybe what mea--
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.	Maybe you married the wrong woman.	Watch your mouth.	That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.	Time's up.
So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?	I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?	No.	You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.	Why thank you.	You've never been out of Boston.	No.	"So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term ""visiting hours"" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?"
"You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like ""we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet,"" and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says ""man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee."" So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes ""don't forget the coffee!"""	You've never been on a plane.	I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
Yeah? You got a lady now?	Yeah, I went on a date last week.	How'd it go?	Fine.	Well, are you going out again?	I don't know.	Why not?	Haven't called her.	Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.	I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...	So Christ, call her up.	Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.	And right now you're perfect too. Maybe you don't want to ruin that.
I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.	You ever think about gettin' remarried?	My wife's dead.	Hence, the word remarried.	My wife's dead.	Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.	No, I don't.	Why not?	I gave that up when my wife got sick.	Is that why you didn't write anything else?	I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.	Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?	Yeah.	What happened to that guy from Kentucky?	Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.	Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?	What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
You don't regret meetin' your wife?	Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.	When did you know she was the one?	October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.	Where were you?	I was havin' a drink with my future wife.	You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?	That's right.	So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?	You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.	I don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar! That's game six of the World Series!
"I just slid my ticket across the table and said ""sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."""	"""I gotta go see about a girl""? What did they say?"	They could see that I meant it.	You're kiddin' me.	No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I had gone to see that game I'd be in here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago. And how I always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. I don't regret the eighteen years we were married. I don't regret givin' up couseling for six years when she got sick. I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. And I sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game.
Would have been nice to catch that game though.	Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
So you might be working for Uncle Sam.	I don't know.	Gerry says the meeting went well.	I guess.	What did you think?	What did I think?
Do you think you're alone?	What?	Do you have a soul-mate?	Define that.	Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.	Yeah.
They're all dead.	Not to me, they're not.	But you can't give back to them, Will.	Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...	That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.	Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?	Don't give me you line of shit.	I didn't want the job.	It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?	I didn't ask for this.	Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.	Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.	You're right, Will. Any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.
What?	If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.	What?
I been there. I played my hand.	That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!	Look at me. What do you want to do?
Well, I'm here.  So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy.	Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.	Do you want to talk about it?
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.	You're not going to fail me are you?
You want to read it?	No.  Have you had any experience with that?	Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--	--No, have you had any experience with that?	Yes.	It sure ain't good.
Gotta go with the belt there...	I used to go with the wrench.	The wrench, why?	Cause fuck him, that's why.
Oh, I know.	It's not your fault.	I know.	It's not your fault.	I know.	It's not your fault.	I know.	It's not your fault.	Don't fuck with me.	It's not your fault.	I know.	It's not...	I know, I know...
Which one did you take, Will?	Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.	That's what you want?	Yeah, I think so.	Good for you. Congratulations.	Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?	We're done. You did your time. You're a free man.
I just want you to know, Sean...	You're Welcome, Will.	I'll keep in touch.	I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
No. Thank you.	Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?	Only if you grab my ass.
See ya.	Good luck.
You suck.	What?	I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.	I'm Will.	Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.	I kind of got that impression.	Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.	I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...	Here's my number.
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.	What?	When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.	Okay, sounds good.
Five minutes.	What?	I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.	See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.	The caramel thing is my pick-up line.
Yeah?	It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?	I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.	Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.	Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.	Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.	Sounds good, where are you now?	You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...	I bet your parents were happy to pay.	I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.	Is Harvard gettin' all that money?	Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.	So you just want to use me and go?	Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.	In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?	Sure.
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.	Okay...
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?	No.	Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing.
I really don't 'date' that much.	You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.	No I haven't...	Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.	No I wasn't...	Yes you were.	"I was kinda' hopin' to get a ""good night laid"" but...I'll take a kiss."
Oh, you will?	No...I was hoping to get a kiss.	Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
Free?	Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.
You grew up around here?	Not far from here, South Boston.	How was that?	Pretty boring, I guess.
I bet you have a great family.	You know, nothing special.	You have a lot of brothers and sisters?	Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?	Yeah.	Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?	How many?	You wouldn't believe me if I told you.	What, five?
I have twelve big brothers.	Not a chance.	Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.	Bullshit.	I swear to God.	Your house must have been a zoo.	It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.	Do you know all their names?	'Course I do, they're my brothers.	Well...	Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.	Do you keep in touch with them?	All the time. We all live in Southie. I live with three of them now.
I want to meet them.	We'll do that.
Where have you been?	I'm sorry, I been real busy.	You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.	Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.	"You should have called. I have an ""O- chem"" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible.  It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look:"
Promise?	If you bring the caramels.
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.	How the hell did you do that?	Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?	I'm supposed to understand this.	You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?	No.	Then let's go have some fun.
Why do we always stay here?	'Cause it's nicer than my place.	I've never seen your place.	Exactly.	What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?	They don't come over here that much.	I think I can make it to South Boston.	Aah, it's kind of a hike.	Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?	All right, all right. We'll go.	When?	Sometime. I don't know. Next week.	What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?	I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.	Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
I thought you said you'd show me your place.	Not tonight.
How's it goin'?	Fine.	Want me to take a look?	No.	C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.	It's important that I learn this.	Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.	Clearly.	You're rich. What do you have to worry about?	Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.	Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? SKYLAR No, so I can be a doctor.
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?	I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?	Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?	Some, a little.	Just for fun?	I guess so.	"Nobody does organic chemistry for ""fun."" It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you."	Like me?	Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.
Do you play the piano?	Come one Will. I just want to know.	I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.	"I see ""Hot Cross Buns,"" but okay."	Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.	So, do you play the piano?	Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--	--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--	--When it came to stuff like that I could always just play.
Will? Are you awake?	No.	Come with me to California.	What?	I want you to come with me.	How do you know that?	I know. I just do.	Yeah, but how do you know?	I don't know. I just feel it.	And you're sure about that?	Yeah, I'm sure.	"'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like ""hey this is a big mistake.""  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back."	"""Take-back?"" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me."	I can't go out to California.	Why not?	One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--	Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.	I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.	Then what are you afraid of?	"What do you mean ""What am I afraid of?"""	Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?	What am I scared of?	Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--	--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--	Is that what you think--	--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.	I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.	At least you have a mother.	Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.	What the fuck am I afraid of?!	You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.	I'm not honest?	What about your twelve brothers?	Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear?	Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?	No, you don't want to hear that.	Yes, I do, Will.	You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?	"What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says ""save me"" on my back?"	"I don't want to ""save"" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you!"
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!	You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
I just wanted to call before you left.  I'm takin' all these job interviews. So I won't just be a construction worker.	I never cared about that.
Yeah.	I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
Take care.	Goodbye.
You doin' the hirin'?	Well, I'm contracting the land.
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.	You trying to tell me how to run my own business?	'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?	Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.	Joe!
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!	Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'?
Will ya look at her!	I never knowed they was anything like her!
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--	Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Ready, Pa?	Let 'er go, Gallagher!
Twenty days work, oh boy!	Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.	How 'bout you?	*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.	But ain't no reason--	Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.	Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.	Sure. Why not?
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?	We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.	That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.	I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
I'd come back--	But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.
But it ain't runnin' away, Ma. All I wanta do is go away with another fella an' look aroun' for work by ourself--	Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
Ready, Ma?	I'll get Rosasharn.
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.	Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?	No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.	Watch me pass that Chevvy.
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.	Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?	Don't hold me so tight.	Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!	You're *ticklin' me!*	That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*	Now I can't breathe.
You bust outa jail, Tom?	Naw. They paroled me.	Oh.
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?	People done it. If they could, we could.	Lots must a died, too.	Well, we ain't out a it yet.
Tom? You can come on. They gone.	We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
Maybe the road's out.	I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.	Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
She's hotter'n a heifer.	Fan-belt's shot.
Any gas?	Gallon or two?	Well, looks like we done it this time awright!
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?	She got to make it.
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?	I guess that's what he looked like.	We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.	What'd he look like again?	Short fella. Pale face.	Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?	I didn't see nothin'.	Okay. Go on.
Kinda pie y'got?	Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.	Cut me off a hunk a that banana cream, and a cuppa java.
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.	What's it to you?	Them was nickel apiece candy.
So long.	Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Want to work?	Sure, but what is this?	That's not your affair. Name.	Joad.	How many men?	Four.	Women?	Two.	Kids?	Two.	Can all of you work?	Why, I guess so.	Okay. House 63. Wages 5 cents a box. No bruised fruit. Move along and go to work right away.
House 25. Number's on the door.	Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?	Two and a half cents.	Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.	Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.	But--but how we gonna eat?	Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.	Which way is House 25?
Open up! We hear you got a riot.	Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?	Deputy sheriffs.	Got a warrant?	We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.	Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot.  Look for yourself.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?	Joad. Tom Joad.	How many of you?
Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.	We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?	We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.	Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?	That's the way it is.	An' you say no cops?	No cop can come in here without a warrant.	I can't hardly believe it. Camp I was in once, they burned it out--the deputies an' some of them poolroom fellas.	They don't get in here. Sometimes the boys patrol the fences, especially dance nights.	You got dances too?	We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.	Say, who runs this place?	Government.	Why ain't they more like it?	*You* find out, I can't.	Anything like work aroun' here?	Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.	Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.	That cut you got?	Crate fell on me.	Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.	Goodnight.
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?	Yeah. On my way home now.	Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.	Why, you're the preacher!	*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.	Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.	I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.	Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.	At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.	I never let one go by me when I could catch her.	But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.	Have a little snort?	Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.	Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.	Been out travelin' around?	Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.	No, I never. What?	I been in the penitentiary for four years.	Excuse me for asking.	I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.	And you ain't ashamed?	He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.	Ain't you seen your folks since then?	No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?	It don't matter. Ever since I lost the sperit it looks like I just as soon go one way as the other.  I'll go your way.
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.	I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.	Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!	Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
Is it fur?	Just around that next bend.
Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.	That's our place.
They're all gone--or dead.	They never wrote you nothing?	No. They wasn't people to write.
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?	I never heard nothin' about it.
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?	I ain't no preacher anymore.	All right, you remember the *man* then.
She's settlin'.	What you figger to do?	It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know.
Think she'll hold?	If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
I ain't no more a preacher, you know.	We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.	"I'll say 'em--an' make it short.  This here ol' man jus' lived a life an' jus' died out of it. I don't know whether he was good or bad, an' it don't matter much. Heard a fella say a poem once, an' he says, ""All that lives is holy."" But I wouldn't pray for jus' a ol' man that's dead, because he's awright. If I was to pray I'd pray for the folks that's alive an' don't know which way to turn. Grampa here, he ain't got no more trouble like that. He's got his job all cut out for 'im--so cover 'im up and let 'im get to it."
How about us? Is that the truth for us?	I don't know.
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.	I ain't gonna run.	He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?	You're right!	Hide in the willows. If it's awright to come back I'll give you four high whistles.
What's the matter?	Casy! What you doin' here?	Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?	Thought you was in jail.	No, I done my time an' got out. Come on in.
Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?	I dunno. Payin' five now.	I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?	I aim to.	Well--tell the folks inside how it is, Tom. Tell 'em they're starvin' us and stabbin' theirself in the back. An' as sure as God made little apples it's goin' back to two an' a half jus' as soon as they clear us out.
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.	Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!	They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.	But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.	We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?	Got to learn, like I'm a-learnin'. Don't know it right yet myself, but I'm tryin' to fin' out. That's why I can't ever be a preacher again. Preacher got to *know*.  I don't. I got to *ask*.
Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?	I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.	Women is always tar'd.	You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?	No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.	But we can still do it, honey.	I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.	Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.	We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--	Lissen, I heard that before--
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.	Want to work, do you?	Sure do.	Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.	What's the matter? What's happened?	Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.	Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?	For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.	But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?	*Used* to be your land. B'longs to the comp'ny now.
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.	You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
How about a lift, mister?	Can't you see that sticker?
Goin' far?	Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.	Lookin' for a job?	No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.	Oh!
Been doin' a job?	Yeah.	I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?	Why don't you get to it, buddy?	Get to what?	You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?	I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.	Naw--not much!	I stay in my own yard.	Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?	You ain't got to get sore.	Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.	I didn't mean nothing.	Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?	Yeah.	That's where I get off.
I never asked you!	Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.
You people got a lotta nerve.	What you mean?	Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.	You been acrost?	Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.	If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.	Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.	It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do.
Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?	This here's a strike.	Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.	Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?	Sure. We made a buck since midday.
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.	Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
What's he fixin' to do, ma?	Hush!
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.	You want to get ast to eat, hunh?	Yes, ma'am.	Didn' you have no breakfast?	No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.	Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.	I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.	But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.	All but me! I'm a-stayin'.
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.	And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.	Ain't a-goin', thas all...	Put somepin' over him, so he won't git sun-struck.  Ever'body set now?  Awright, Al, letta go!
"You know what I al'ays said: ""Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence."" Can't keep no Joad in jail!"	I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
What's the matter, Grampa?	Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
How 'bout Granma?	Take her with you!
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.	And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...	'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
Where you going?	California.	How long you plan to be in Arizona?	No longer'n we can get acrost her.	Got any plants?	No plants.	Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.	Sure. We aim to.
Where you think you're going?	Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?	Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.	You mean I can't even get outa here?	Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?	I'll walk back.
You take this.  I ain't hungry.	Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.	I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.	You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.	Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.	You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
I got to get a lot curiouser than I am--with all them cops out there.	Okay. I be back a little later.
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?	Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.	Sometimes I'm all jumpy inside.	Well, can't nobody get through nine *months* without sorrow.	But will it--hurt the baby?	They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.	You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?	Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.	Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?	No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.	Maybe that's jus' what he done.
We gonna live here?	Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.	I like the tent better.	This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
Anybody ask anything?	No'm.	Stand by the door.
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.	I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.	Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.	I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make *me* giggly an' happy.
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.	An' you won't let nobody touch me?	No--an' look what I got for you.
How 'bout it?	Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!	Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--	You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.	Now don't get sassy, Ma.	Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.	I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
Jus' sassy, that's all.	Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.	Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--	Pa! Shh!	How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.	It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
That!	They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
Know where we're a-goin'?	Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.
Make her easy, John. Watch her.	She'll be awright.
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.	I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people.
Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?	No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.	I'd a found you, Ma.
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?	We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?	Mad, Ma?	Sometimes they do.	No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.	Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?	No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.	Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son
How about it, Ma?	I'm ready.
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.	Don't taste bad.	And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...	That's right. And douse some in it.
Yes'm, that was it.	Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.	Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.	Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.	Forget it, Ma. Jus' think about the nice things out there. Think about them grapes and oranges--an' ever'body got work--
Ma, you sick?	Ya say we're acrost?	Look, Ma!	Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us.	Didn' you get no sleep?	No.	Was Granma bad?	Granma's dead.	When?	Since before they stopped us las' night.	An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?	I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?	On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.	Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.	I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.	You promised, Tommy.	I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.	You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.	What's that--detour?
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.	Get some sugar too, for the coffee.	You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before!
Got any more, Ma?	No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
I ain't full.	Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.	Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.
How's it feel, Tommy?	Busted my cheek but I can still see. What'd you hear?	Looks like you done it.	I kinda thought so. Felt like it.	Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.	They killed Casy first.	That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.	They know what--this fella looks like?	They know he got hit in the face.	I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.	It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.	I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.	Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.	Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.	Comes night we'll get outa here.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.	I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
What is it?	Don't know--but it's better'n this.
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.	Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.	It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.	I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.	I could hide you, Tommy.	I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.	Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?	You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.	He was a good man.	I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--	Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.	They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...	You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!	No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.	How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?	Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...	Then what, Tom?	Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.	I don't understan' it, Tom.	Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by.	Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?	Sure. Good-by.	Good-by, Tommy.
Yeah?	Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.	This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.	I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.	Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.	I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.	You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.	Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
You can have this for ten cents.	I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.	Go ahead--Bert says take it.
Which ones?	There, them stripy ones.
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.	Well, give me two then, ma'am.
Tommy?	Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?	They gone.	I know that! But *where* they gone?
Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.	But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.	Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.	But who done it?	Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.	Are you crazy?	Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?	That's what I asked you, ain't it?
Well?	They come. They come and pushed me off.
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.	But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!	The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look out for. And ain't nobody comin' back. They're gone-- and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world I am.
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!	Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.	You're *trespassin'*! It ain't you lan' no more! An' that's the supr'tendant--with a gun!
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.	Won't they come out here?	I don't think so. One come out here once an' I clipped him from behin' with a fence stake. They ain't bothered since.
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.	But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.	I can't help that. All I know is I got my orders. They told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what I'm telling you.
You mean get off my own land?	Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?	It ain't nobody. It's a company.
Then who *do* we shoot?	Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!	Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! So just come on and try to push me off!
That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.  She's due about three-four months.	Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
How you get all this money?	Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.	Easy. After all, they ain't but about *twelve* of us, is they?
Either we got to tie him up and *throw* him on the truck, or somepin. He can't stay here.	Can't tie him. Either we'll hurt him or he'll git so mad he'll hurt his self.  Reckon we could git him *drunk*?	Ain't no whisky, is they?
Here we go!	California, here we come!
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.	Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.	Casy, won't you say a few words?
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.	How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
She's jus' wore out, that's all.	I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.	Me an' you both.
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.	I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.	Give 'im a fryin' pan.
You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.	Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?	No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.	We gonna stay, ain't we?	You're tootin' we're gonna stay.
Good wages, eh! Pickin' oranges an' peaches?	We gonna take whatever they got.
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!	Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!	But what about this?	I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
But what does *that* prove?	Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
Heh'o Tom.  This is Connie, my husband.	If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!	You do not see either!--not yet!
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.	Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck.  Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright.	Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.	Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus' don't cry.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!	I wisht it was day.	Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.	Man bones?	Some, I guess, but mos'ly cow bones.
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.	Whatsa matter?	It's them white things, made outa dish-stuff, like in the catalogues!
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.	Won't they ketch us?
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!	Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!	I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!	Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?	Please don't.	I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!
What's these?	Well, I reckon you *stan'* in them little rooms--an' water come down outa that there little jigger up there--take a bath!
Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they!	I seen 'em b'fore you did.	What's this?	Now don't you go monk'ing--
Now you done it! You busted it!	I never--
Morning.	Morning.	You people looking for work?	Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.	Can you pick peaches?	We can pick anything.	Well, there's plenty of work for you about forty miles north, this road just outside Pixley. Turn east on 32 and look for Hooper's ranch. Tell 'em Spencer sent you.
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.	Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
You sure you got ever'thing ready?	Ain't gonna be no trouble.	You ain't to hurt them fellas.
Yes, sir.	Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.	Ain't gonna get outa han'.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.	I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
You do not.	Yes I do.	You don't...	In the corporate offices.	Oh... really?	Yeah...	What do you do?	I sell biscuits to the Southland.	You do not.	It's what I do.	You're so funny...	I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--	--Stop it--	You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--	--No.	Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.	I'm Martin Blank.
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!	Don't say that.
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!	Wonderful.	So, what are you doing now?	Whatever I can get away with.
Bob. Bob Destephano.	What?	I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.	Computer guy.	Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.	I sell BMW's. What do you do?	Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really.
Remember high school?	Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
Bob...	What?	It's me. Martin Blank.	Really...? So what?	Okay. See you later.
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?	Fine, Bob. How are you?	Never better.	Really?
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...	You could've been a contender, huh?
What am I gonna do?	What do you want to do?	I want to be an actor.	Then express yourself, Bob.
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.	He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.	It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.	A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.	Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.	Insane.	To make a long story short...
Jesus...	Overflowing with love.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.	You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.	So you eat-- read it everyday?	Yes.	And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?	Correct.  That's for you. Keep it.
I just play my own collection.	It's nice to see you again.
How long has it been?	Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?	Ten years, I think. What I miss?
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.	Here is now there. There is here.
Tell me about yourself.	I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.	That's it?	Not much else.	What's your business?	I'm a professional killer.	Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.	Okay.
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?	Where have I been?	More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?	I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--	--Torn down in the name of convenience--	--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.	Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?	You see someone?	Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?
Are you going to the reunion?	No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?	That's part of it.	Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...	It's always the little things.	Yep.
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.	Well, there's not much to tell.	I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.	Bad experiences.	You met people.	Bad people.	Watched television?	Bad television.	Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.	What's that?	It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.	That'd be good.
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.	Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?	Yes.	Unbelievable.	Seven it is.	I'll think about it.
Are you there?	Yes.	Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
Hello...?	This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.	You're fucking psycho.	Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
Flowers. That's funny.	As long as I get the laugh.	Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
You look beautiful.	Okay... Hold on...
...Let me get my coat.	I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
Do you want to get a drink first?	I think they'll probably have booze there.	Right.
Shoulda brought my gun.	What?
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--	We haven't seen each other since high school.
Which would you rather...?	Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?	Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--	--She's not dead---	It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?	Wow. I have to give this some thought.	No time.	Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.	Like heroin?	Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.	Like love?	Could be. The physical substance of love.
He was trying to kill you, right!	Yes.	Not the other way around...?	No.	Is it something you've done?	It's something I do...
...About five years now.	Get the fuck outta here.	"Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain ""Moral flexibility"" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called ""mechanical operations."" We sort of found each other..."	You're a government spook?
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.	Jesus Christ!	Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.	Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....	Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.	Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!	A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.	You never could have kept this from me.	I was leaving.	That's probably a good idea.	Will you come with me?	I'm staying here.	What if I come back?	I'll hide.
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.	You don't understand...	That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
You kill people.	I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.	Other people can't.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?	It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
You went to school with these people.	Come on.	We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.	Shouldn't you be taking notes?	Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
How do you know?	I just know.	Say more.	"They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  ""I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."""
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.	"Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be ""withholding""... and I know where you live."	You know where I live?	We're both professionals, Oatman.	"I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, ""Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens.""  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families."	So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?	Yes.	Mmm.
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?	Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.	Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.	If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.	What stuff?	Morality.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.	If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
What else? Say more.	Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
Okay. Repeat this after me.	Out Loud?
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.	Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.	This is me breating.
How was your day, today, sir?	Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.	Do you like the people you work with?	I work alone.	"That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, ""Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!"" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?"	You understand the psychology of the job.	I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it.
You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?	No.	Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.	Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.	It's only natural....
I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.	Okay.	Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind.  I am part of what I call a brain syndicate.
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.	Up on the right.	And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?
What do you want?	I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.	Like a union?	Like a club. Work less, make more.	Thank you, no.	We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.	And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.	Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.	I'm gonna get you, kid.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.	Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.	No harm no foul.	A little misunderstanding among my associates.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.	Hard to get good help these days.	But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.	"I didn't get into this business to have ""associates."" And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. ""Loner-- "" ""Loner gunman."" Get it? ""On my own."" That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!"
No deal.	Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...	Is that right?	Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.	Nice talk, Sugarmouth.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.	I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.	Don't listen to him, he's a professional.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?	Okay.
There you go. I left it blank.	Excellent. Here they come.
Hey, Ken. How have you been?	Hello Martin. How have you been?	Not bad. You?
Hello, Bob.	Hey, Bob.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.	That sounds pretty interesting...
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.	Those all seem kind of related...
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.	Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?	Nope.
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.	I guess.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.	Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.	Lisbon?	In Portugal, yes.
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?	In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
Well?	I don't think so.	Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --	--Nooo--	--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in '72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened.
That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.	It was the PLO.	Whatever.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.	We can't do our job unless he does his job.	Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.	Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.	Wait a minute--	-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.	So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.	Yup.
He's falling for her. Look at him.	He using her.	You're wrong. Look at his face.	One cannot love and kill.	I love. I kill.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.	If he does our job, he's our job.	I get it.
Did you see Blank in there?	No...	Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.	Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.	Patch him through....
Throw that away.	This?	Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.	It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?	Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.	All of it?	And not show it to me. Ever again.	That's going to cost.	I'll pay.
They're not happy, sir.	I'm not happy.	They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.	He didn't.	They blame you for the compromise.	And they want me to make up for it.	In Detroit. This weekend.	Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.	They were very upset.	Would you describe their position as inflexible?	Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....	There's nothing to be done about it.	I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.	Good. What else? Anything interesting?	Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
Enough?	Never enough.	But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.
I have scruples. Next.	Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
Don't forget your identity.	See you next week.
This is not good.	I'll do it tomorrow.
What's it look like?	It's fine.	You haven't looked at the dossier.	I've looked at it.
You have.	Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.	I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.	Tell them my house exploded.
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.	Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.	Will do.
I bought a new rug.	That's wonderful, Mom.	What's a revival tent?	It's a place where religious people--	Marlin Perkins and Jim!	Jim?	His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass!
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.	I spoke to your father the other day.	I imagine that'd be rather difficult.	Nature made him then broke the mold.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.	Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.	You have a headache?	I have a headache. You have a headache?	No, I don't have one.	You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?	Yeah. I guess we did.
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.	I think I'll go see Debi today.	Of course you will.	I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.	Take care of her. She's a keeper.	Yeah...	And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?	I have always thought about her and missed her.
Marty! It's me. Paul.	Paul?	You're leaving me hanging here...
So what happened to you?	Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.	Fair enough.
God it's great to see you.	You too.
Debi's house.	Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?	No. You drove us here.	Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?	No.
Ten years. What happened!?	I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.	Thank you.
He sells BMW's?	He sold me this bad boy.	How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?	He gave me a great deal.	Mein Dealer.
What the hell happened to you?	I was catching up with Bob Destephano.	As long as you had a good time.
It didn't work out.	That's too bad.	I have to get my head back into my work.	Work's good for the soul.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.	See you in ten years.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?	Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer.
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.	To shoot you. Correct.	How did you get this job?	Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...	Wow.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.	Good evening, Mr. Blank.	How are you? How's business?	Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.	How's that?	I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.	I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?	Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
Why not?	So what are you doing with your life now, son?	I'm a professional killer.	That's good.
This is Annie MacLean.	Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --	Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.	Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --	Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.	Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...	Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...	I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.	Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.	Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --	I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.	Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!	Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...	Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?	Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...	You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?	Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.	All by yourself?
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --	"Look! Please! Don't do the ""shucks, ma'am"" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?"
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.	You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.	Doesn't matter.	Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.	Well, that'll be a little complicated --	You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am I right? So here's the deal. I'm not sure I can do anything, but I'm prepared to give it a go --  -- if you'll help.  You have a problem with that?
Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--	Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine.
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.	Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?	That's up to Pilgrim.
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.	Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
You okay?	It is cocktail hour yet?
So how was your first and last day of branding?	Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
What?	You ever just stand still for a minute?	You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger.  You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.	Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?	It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.	Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.	Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?	What's that to miss?	Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.	Does Chicago count?	You lived in Chicago?	When I was first married.	You were married to a woman in Chicago?
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?	Well, I, uh... you didn't...	Just who's been laughing at who here?
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.	A jogger, huh?	I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.	Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.	If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...	You sleeping all right in that house?	I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.	Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.	I thought you lived in Chicago?	I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
I have a way with animals.	It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.	Oh yes. I forgot.
He's beautiful.	Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.	She did?
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?	Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
Enjoy the day.	You too.
Shit.	Need a lift?	I can handle it!
The answer's no.	You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...	Poor thing.	He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.	Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?	No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.	Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...	OK. I'll stop talking then.
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.	Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.	Thanks.	Feel good?	Yeah.	You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?	OK.
How long did you live here with your wife?	Five years. My son was born here.	Son?	Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.	How did you meet her?	College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
Why didn't it work out?	She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.	It is. It's lovely.	Ever think of moving there full time?	We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...	That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.	Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.	How did you find out all that?
Everything under control?	Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.	Just make yourself comfortable.	I am comfortable.	Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
You missed a button.	Huh?
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.	Tom.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.	What?!
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.	I won't ask you to.
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --	Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
Show me again.	Annie!	One more time.
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.	I don't care! We'd be together.	Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...	I can't do this. I can't leave you...
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.	How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
I don't know any other way, Annie.	Why?
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?	The point was to love each other.	Why?
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --	I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
Why don't you go lie down?	I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?	Okay.
Oh, honey... What happened?	Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.	Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --	I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!	Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...	Is that your version of a pep talk?	You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.	Fine!	It's still early. What's your next class?
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.	I brought it to you in the hospital.	No, you didn't.	Grace, I put it on the table near your --	Doesn't matter.
Have you decided about Pilgrim?	What about him?	Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...	I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.	I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.	Mom?	Yeah?	Maybe they should put me down too.	What?	I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --	Fine -- I'll take my bath.
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --	-- enough time tomorrow. I know.	Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.	I don't care.
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?	Whatever you want.	Fine!	Fine.
You should call your dad before it gets too late.	I already did.  This morning. When you went running.	Oh. You didn't tell me.	I didn't know I had to.	You don't.
Would you like to see that?	I don't care.	I don't care.
This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.	You were never thirteen, Mom.
How long is this going to go on?	What?	You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?	What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!	Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!	I don't believe this!	You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!	That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.	You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.	Did he tell you that?	He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.	That's not true!	Then why do you want to leave?	It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.	No, you just act like you do.
You buckled up?  You cold?	Little.
Gee, this looks like a fun place.	Don't they believe in signs here?	"What would they say? ""Ten miles to big rock."" ""Twenty miles to bigger rock."""	There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?	I didn't see it.
He's still sitting in that damn field.	I think they call it a pasture.
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.	Hi.
Did you ask him to come visit?	You already did.	Did he mention it?	Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
You got everything you need?	If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?	Why? There's no food in the house?	No. I just thought... forget it.
I'll come.	Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
I thought there were too many forks on the table.	Well, one was for salad...	Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.	You're right. Good.
Does anybody out there want something to drink?	I'll take care of it.	Thanks, honey.
Nothing.	Did you go riding?
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?	About what?	Well...  So you tried riding again?	Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!	Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --	... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?	What are you talking about?	You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.	Grace, I don't hate your father.	I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.	I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --	Tom?
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...	Yeah, you know everything!!	STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!	NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.	WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.	Well, now you know what it feels like.
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.	FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.	Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.	LEAVE ME ALONE!!
What did you say?	I said... I started.
Started what?	My period.	When? Tonight?	I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
Who's going to want me now?	What?... Oh baby...	Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.	That's not true.	Why should they?	Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...	What?	So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...
Who is it?	Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?	Sure.
Let's bring your bags inside.	Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?	Tom's gone.
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.	Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.	So do you.	How's everything?	Good.	Hi.
Great!	Go ahead...
David?	Who's there?	Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.	Did you speak to Farlow?	Yes. We're suing.	Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.	David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you?
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...	Exactly...
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.	Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?	If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
Uh, yes... Sure, David.	All right. Speak to you then.
It's me.	Hi.	Hi.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?	I should be in by two.	Okay. You want me to pick you up?	Sure... What's Grace up to?	Riding with Judith.
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.	That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?	I don't know. We'll figure it out.
Okay. We'll see you later then.	Yeah. Bye.
What about Grace?	She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
That bag's almost empty.	No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.	Robert, you leave it up these people...!
I'm sorry.	Tch. What are you --
What did he say?	Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
I should go get some of her things.	No, let me go.	No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.	We're very lucky.	The funeral's on Friday.
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...	Okay.	It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?	Oh. Right. I'll call him.
"""... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'..."	Sing it to me, Frankie!	How's my pregnant chick!
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.	I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.	Aw... that's so sweet.	I love you.	Do you? Do you really?
You've got to stop doing that?	Doing what?	Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
How was the dinner?	"All our ""favorite"" people were there saying all their ""favorite"" things about their ""favorite"" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with."	Why did you go?	They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?	Yeah.	What did he say?	No.
What was I saying?	About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
I don't understand. You just said he said no.	He did, but... I think I can change his mind.	That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.	Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.	NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?	I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...	You've already made arrangements!?	No. I was just researching. Calm down.	I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...	I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.	You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --	He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.	What... Bo-... What about the magazine?	I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea	Why?!	Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...	I can't say he's been all that effective with her.	Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.	I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.	I'm not pretending anything!
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.	Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
What if she doesn't want to go?	She will if you think she should.	And you think it's best if I don't come.	No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?	Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.	Well, it's good that you're there.
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?	Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.	When are you coming home?	You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.	Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.	Okay.
I miss you, Annie.	I know. We miss you too.	Good night.	Night.
I thought you guys were going to call me.	Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.	Oh well... branding will do that to you.	Everything all right.	Huh-huh. You?	Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.	I wish I did.
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.	About what?	Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.	Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.	Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.	You're allergic to hay.	I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...	You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.	I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare.
You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...	No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.	How are you feeling about work?	Let's not talk about that now.
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?	Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?	Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.	May I have a suggestion?	Yeah, what?	Take your time.	What do you mean?
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.	I don't understa-	And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...  And I don't want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other.
Yes?	"Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for ""Tubab"" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you ""Tubab""?"	"No. I am a ""tubab."""	What do you mean?	Tubab means white man.
Was the trip okay?	Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
I have so much to tell you.	You want to take a walk with me?	Where to?	I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.	Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow.  Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...	Oh, I don't know...	Well, I know Peterson's. Old place is as good as falling down around your ears.
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?	We have a business manager. The best around.
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?	Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
It's so cruel.	No. He had the choice.	What choice!!?	Either fight the way things are or accept it.
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.	Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?	Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?	Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?	Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.	No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place.
How's Peterson's holding up for you?	It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
Where does this go, Diane?	Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...	She calls him Tommy...	Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.	I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Thank you. You're all doing too much.	Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
I'll help you with the coffee.	Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.	No reason you should, no reason you should.
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?	I was there for that shot, actually.	What was it like?	Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.	I'd love to go there one time...	You and Frank ever take a vacation?	Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?	Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.	They fired you?	No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.	You don't seem to upset?	Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.	Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?	I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.	Frank's a good man.	They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...	Sounds like something Tom would say.	Yes, it does.
What?	Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.	I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.	He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.	Well, I am going to go after lunch.	No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.	Oh, how sweet.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.	I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.	Promise?	Promise.
Good luck to you, Annie.	You too, Diane.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?	Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.	Oh God, Annie, I'm so sorry. I... I know you're being hit with a low now, I don't want to take too much of your time but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...	Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...	Well, of course, right...
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --	I understand, but Annie, please...	- See, what you can do for him --...	Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.	... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --	It isn't right to make him suffer...	And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem!  I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay?  Please.
Maybe we should give him another sedative.	Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?	Of course not.	Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?	Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.	I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long.
Mixed salad.	What?	I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom?
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.	It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.	You!
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.	Diane!	Frank's touchy about his cousins.  Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
I don't believe they'll expect that.	What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.	Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
Ha...	Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.	Ain't brain surgery.
I have some brownies left over. Want one?	No thanks.
Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?	Sure. As long as she don't mind.	There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.	That's what some folks say.	There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese. He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow.  You hear 'bout that, Uncle T?
When you figure on branding?	Weekend after next...
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.	Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.	Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
I don't believe it.	You know her?
Tom?	Yeah.
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.	We should be fine, then.
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.	Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...	And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...	I don't think Warren would go for that.
We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.	He thought it was a ghost.
Don't you go to school?	Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
Why do you always wear that hat?	Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
Would you let me ride your horse?	Have you talked to Tom about it?	Of course I have.	I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?	I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.	I wouldn't let happen.	You know, you're a good kid.
Yeah?	Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
She gonna be long?	Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.	What does she do?	She's an editor.	Mmm. An editor.	Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
Isn't it like, obvious?	Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
That's not a question, is it?	You're catching on.
Can you drive?	Drive? I'm not old enough yet.	It's never too soon to start.
I can't...	I don't have all day.
Put the key in and turn it.  The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.	I don't know if I can with my leg.	Well, there's only one way to find out.  Give it a little gas.
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.	I don't know if I can.	Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?	We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.	That must have been pretty special.
Are you afraid of anything?	Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess.  What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...	I know where he goes.	I know you do. Don't you disappear.  You do whatever you have to, to hold on...  I'll tell you one more thing... When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what I think?... I think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... That's what I think.
I can't... not yet...	There's no hurry. Take you time.
Sure?	Sure.
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?	What does that mean?	It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.	I want to watch.
Grace, I need you to come with me.	No, you're only going to hurt him some more.	He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.	No!	Grace, Listen... you've got to do this. Just trust me one more time.
It's warmer than I thought.	You want to go to a movie tonight?	I thought your mom's coming up?	So?
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.	Can I come? I'll start a fire...
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!	I just could never say it!
Do you want to go around by the old road?	Why don't we just cut through the woods?
You want to go down or stay along the river?	We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
"""... and I said that""..."	"No, wait, it just goes... ""he said he liked to do-""..."
Jude, you okay?	I'm okay... I'm okay.
Have you heard from Judith's parents?	No, not yet.	How's Pilgrim doing?
Dad! I can do it, OK?!	OK, OK.
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?	No, I'm just not that hungry.
You want to watch some television?	Maybe... look -- just...
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?	NO!
What, sweetheart?	I want to see Pilgrim.
Did you notice -- no cane?	I know. Amazing.	Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?	I did. He said he had work to do until late.
IT WAS MY TURN!	YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.	WAS SO!
Don't be such a baby!	You just showing off for her!	You shut up, stupid!	You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.	Oh yeah...
I can't believe it's the same horse.	We still have a way to go.	How much longer do you think?
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.	I understand...
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?	I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
Hey, darlin'.	Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.	I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
You're looking fit.	Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?	If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.	Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.	Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.	I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.	The number's by the phone.
What are you looking at, young man?	How long were you married?	Long enough.	You ever miss it?	Does a horse miss a saddle?	Sometimes.
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.	Honey... I was always good.
Well, that'll happen.	Where did you learn all this stuff?	What stuff is that?	About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?	Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.	What do you mean?	Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts.  That's the whole lesson right there. You have a good day now... Just... keep on freeing yourself up.
"Listen to this bullshit.  ""This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto."" Huh, right, manifesto? ""You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."""	Now that's cool.	Cool?	Yeah, cool.	You think it's cool?	It's cool!	It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!
Secret Service!	Don't move!
How's it going, Ray?	It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.	In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.	I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.	Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.	Alright sir.
Welcome to our show!	Hack the Planet!
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.	Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!	And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...	...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!	Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
Let's keep her.	Waste the dude.
She's rabid, but cute.	See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.	Hackers of the World, Unite!	How are you going to take care of the cops?
What's that?	Devil book. The Unix Bible.
What's that?	Dragon book. Compiler design.
Oh yeah? What's that?	The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.	Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?	What is it with this guy?
Shit!	Shh!	Was that her top?
Right.	The sensitive type.
I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.	Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.
What?	Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?	Again?  Yeah sure.
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!	I want it.
Very impressive.	Super hero like even.
Hold on a second!	Look at this, it's so lean and clean.	Looks like a hacker wrote it.
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!	Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!	That's far out!	This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
Ta-da!	Yo, brain dead, the manual!
Snoop onto them...	...as they snoop onto us.
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.	Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
Damn!	A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.	Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?	Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.	Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.	Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?	Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.	It was him, man!	You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.	I'm gonna hit you!
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?	Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.	Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
I want it to have my children!	Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.	Yo, hit the lights.
One-handed!	Difficulty rating?
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.	Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Oh wow, we are fried.	Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.	You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.
Well this hasn't happened yet.	"Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look...  ""Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers"" - they blame hackers!"
Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?	Cereal.	Yeah?	Go fix the phones.	Roger.
Who's that?	Curtis.	And what's he do?	That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?	No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
Did you talk to him?	Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!	Yeah? Display?
Dead.	Dead?	Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.	Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Dade?	Yeah, mom?	What are you doing?	I'm taking over a TV network.	Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?	Mm-hmm.	Up all night again, huh?	Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?	Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.	You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!	Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
How was school?	Hmmm.	What did we learn in school today?	Revenge.	Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?	No. No one special.	Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late.  And would you try and please fill these out?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.	And unpack.
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.	I'm sorry. Who are you?	I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?	Nah. I don't play well with others.
Shit! Come on!	Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?	Blow me.	Thank you!
The girl. The girl has the disc I need.	I told you, I don't play well with others.	Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.	That's bullshit.	What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.	You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.	Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
Talk to me.	I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.	Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.	Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.	Give it up! Just give it up.
I found it! I found it!	This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
Crash Override.	Never heard of you. Done anything?	No.
Yo, showtime, showtime!	What's going on?
That's Razor and Blade.	Razor and Blade.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!	How did you know that?	I got photographic memory.  It's a curse!  Lisa!
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!	Burn!
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!	What's this one eat?	It nibbles. You see this?
Two days.	And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.	Fucked if I care, man.	Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.
Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.	Okay. Let's go shopping.
Oh, shit! He got me.	Joey's getting stupid busy.
Yes!	We did it!
Here's your class.	My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?	No, you're not in my class.
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.	Yeah! Sure.
That's a nice score for a girl.	Think you can do better?	I'll give it a shot.
What the hell is going on?	Pool on the roof must have a leak.
He's not in this class.	I said give me time.	He's not enrolled in this class.
Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of OTV!	What?	I'm Crash Override.	You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
What the hell are you doing?	It's cool, I'm just looking.	It's too much machine for you.	Yeah?
It has a killer refresh rate.	P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.	Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.	Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.	Yeah. RISC is good.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?	"Crash Override. What was it. ""Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"""	Yeah.	Are you challenging me?	Name your stakes.	If I win, you become my slave.	Your slave?	You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.	And if I win?	Make it my first born.	Make it our first date.	You're not gonna win.	And you have to smile.	I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
We need your help.	Do my ears deceive me?
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.	I'm sorry, I can't.	Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
Thank you.	Okay. I'll copy it.	Okay, thank you.
Kate, listen.	Uh, hold on...	I have to tell you something.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.	The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.	And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.	Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.	Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.	Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.	I know, I know who wrote it.	What?	This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.	You what?	I didn't know what was on it.
Why did he come to you?	I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
Well that's great. There goes MIT.	I'll make it up to you!	How?	I'll hack the Gibson.
Shit!!	It's my subway defense system.
Alright, so what have we got?	Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
There they are!	Razor and Blade! They're flakes!	They're elite! Let's get 'em.
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.	It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.	We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
Ready?	Yeah.	Alright, let's boot up.
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.	Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?	I'm trying to help you.
Dade.	What?	Thanks for your help.
Oh, wow, she's great.	Yeah.
You look good in a dress.	You would have looked better.	Wanna go for a swim?
I can't believe they decided you won.	They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.	Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
You know, I've been having these really weird..	Dreams?
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.	Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?	Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...	Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...	Uhhh.. ahahaha...	Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?	Uhhhmm...	It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...	212-555-4240.
Excuse me.	Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.	Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.	Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?	Homicidal?	What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?	No. He's either very smart or very stupid.	Then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. We'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.
Gill.	I think we've got something.
It got you seven years probation. No computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.	Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.	However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.	Gill.
Hello?	We caught 'em.	Good.	Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
You're welcome.	What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
There's a new virus in the database.	What's happening?	It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do?
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.	Cancer?
Colonel who?	The System Command Processor, it's the brain.	Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
Mr. Belford?	My name is the Plague.	Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.	As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?	Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson is working really hard. We got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. I think we've got a hacker.
Never fear. I is here.	I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.	Let's echo 23, see what's up.
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.	Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
Die, dickweeds!	The rabbit is in the administration system.
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...	Joey, Joey...	What? whatwhatwhat?	"One more ""dude"" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it..."
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.	You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?	You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...	D'you bring those Crayola books?
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?	Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?	Love, secret, and uh, sex.  But not in that order, necessarily, right?
Yo, what's up?	Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...	Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.	Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.	Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.	I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?	I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
What is he doing in here?	Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
Any questions?	Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Hello?	Hey, it's me.	Phreak?	I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.	You think they're going to bust us?	Yeah! You better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that place where I put that thing that time?
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.	Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.	Precisely what you're paid to prevent.	Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?
A hacker planted the virus.	Virus?	Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.	Excuse me?	The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.	What, it left a note?
So what are we supposed to do?	Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
What the hell was that all about?	I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.	What?	I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.	I don't want to go to jail for this.	Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.	But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?	Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.	Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...	Sh, sh sh sh sh.
Murphy kid turn you down?	I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.	Pervert! What are you talking about?
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.	Congratulations.	From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.	So?	So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?	Not everything. But enough to implicate us.	You said the worm was untreaceable!	Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.	Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!	No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
What is it? What's wrong?	Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.	"""Minor glitch"" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe."
Send a Flu-shot.	Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
Thank you.	Nonono, thank YOU!
Hello, operator services.	Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.	What number please?	555-4202.	Just one moment.	Thank you.
Purpose of visit?	A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.	You're late.	Yeah.  Should be on the road.	Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?	Real charmer.	I'll take you down there.	All right.
Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?	Jamie needs a Halloween costume.	You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
We need to talk.	Okay sure. What about?	Its about tonight.
What?	My parents baby-sitter canceled.	So?	So I have to watch Jamie tonight.	When did you find this out?	This morning.	Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit	Don't get angry.	I'm not angry it's just
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?	My parents are going to come home early tonight.	So?	I don't know Brady.	Okay, I guess. I'll call you later.
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.	You don't owe me anything.
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.	No, you don't understand.
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.	So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.	I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.	Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
Are you two okay?	We've been better.	What's going on?	Michael Myers.	Who's that?	10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.	Not without Jamie.	Look.
You think she stands a chance?	She's not dead!
Is there another key?	I don't know!
Its metal, god dammit its metal.	What does that mean?	We're trapped in this house.
Brady!	Get back!	Brady!	No. You son of a bitch!
Shit!	Brady! Come with us.	Go!	Brady!	Get up there Rachel!
Brady!	Get up there Rachel!	Brady! Come with us! Brady!	Go!
When did this happen?	Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.	An accident?	Yes, sir.
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.	Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.	Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.	Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
Mom, please	You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.	Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.	Well tonight is very important for your father and me.	Can't you find somebody else?	Its too late.	What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.	Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
How do we look?	You guys always look great.	We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.	I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.	It's okay..it's okay.
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?	Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
Found it.	Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.	Why not?	Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
Honey, I don't think their home.	How do you know their not?	Because the lights are all out.	I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.	We should call the fire department.	I'm not calling the fire department.
Why wasn't I notified?	About what?	You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.	For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.	We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.	I can see this is useless.
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.	I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
Why shouldn't I?	How many people in the bus?	Four plus Myers.	How many bodies did you find?
Now where are you going?	Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.
Yes.	I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.	Has he been prepped?	Ready to go.  Who signs for him?	I do.	Outside.	Check him out.
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.	If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
Watch it.	I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.	Yeah.  Well I guess your happy to see him go.
Night Doc.	Drive Carefully.
Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.	Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.	Who you calling?	Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.	No way. No how.
What the hell did this?	Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?	Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.	You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?	Got it Earl.	Okay, out.
Kido. It's four in the morning.	I can't sleep.	What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?	Do you love me Rachel?	Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.	Like a sister?	Jamie, sometimes it's...	Like a real sister?	We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.
Sure it does.	I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.	It's been eleven months.	Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.	Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.	Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.	I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.	But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.	Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.	I don't want to.	It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy?
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?	Double scoops?	Double scoops. Now lets get some breakfast.
Hi.	You ready for some Ice Cream?	I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.	But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?	You bet.
Come on Rachel.	In a second.
Jamie, what happened?	It was the nightmare man	What?	He's coming to get me Rachel.
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?	Yeah, hurry up.
Come on Rachel!	Coming.	I thought you said you were ready.	I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
Jamie, wait for me.	This is great Rachel. Come on.
Had enough?	No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?	Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
Can we go home soon Rachel?	Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
Jamie!	Oh Rachel!
Rachel come on.	No.	Come on.
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?	I can't.	Well try dammit!
Rachel!	I've got you come on, go down.	Rachel!
What are you doing out here alone?	Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.	Oh no you can't. I've just been there. That's the first place he'll look for you. Where's the school house? Where is the school house?
We'll hear sirens soon.	Then we'll be safe?	Yeah.
You don't believe that do you?	No.
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.	Dad, what's going on?	Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.	Why?	Just do it.
That's all the windows, Dad.	All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
Why don't you go make some coffee.	All right.
Hi Rachel.	Hi.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?	You knew. You just didn't care.	He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.	Don't you mean what you do best?	Wise up to what men want Rachel, or Brady won't be the last man you lose to another woman.
You remember Lindsay don't you?	Hi Jamie.
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.	No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.	I know! Don't you want to talk to him?	I don't want to look pushy.	You won't look pushy.	Well I don't want to come on too strong. A guy hates a girl to come on strong. Fragile egos and all of that.	You won't come on too strong.	Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.	Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.	I don't know.	Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?	Jamie?
Call me.	Okay, bye.
Hell of a night.	Its not over yet.	Where are you going?	The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.	Leave Myers for the state boys.	The state police won't know how to stop him.	Do you?	Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.	Right here, Ben.	You look sharp. You understand?	No problem, Sheriff.
132 to 133 this is 134.	This is 132, over.	Ben-uh-I just heard about the station.
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.	I'll be there in 5 minutes.
You got your riot gun?	Yeah in the trunk of my squad.	Go get it.
Get the outside shutters.	What are we doing?	Making sure that no one can get in here.	Isn't this all a little paranoid?	If you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?	Got it Ben.
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.	Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.	Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?
I am. Ben Meeker.	Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...	Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?	Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.	That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.	He's here, Sheriff.	Why?	10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.	Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?	Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.	Myers has been locked up since before she was born. He's never laid eyes on her.
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.	Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..	Its true, Sheriff.	All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?	Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
When he makes that call.	All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
Something?	He's been here.	How do you know?
This is starting to spook me.	Least I'm not alone.
Is that him? Is that him?	Yes.
Oh Christ. Doc...	Dear God.
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.	They didn't know what they were fighting.
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.	It isn't a man.	What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?	Evil.
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.	Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.	You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Where's that Deputy?	Be here in a minute.
Where's the radio?	Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  Brady, you know how to use a gun?
How's it powered?	Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
It's over.	Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
These kids aren't likely to forget.	They've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
Thank you.	Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
How far are you going, Mr. Sayer?	Gods Country, Promise Land. Where are you heading Mr..ah	Loomis. Haddonfield.	Car trouble?	Sort of.	Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.	What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?	Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
I know that Mr. Sayer.	Oh your a pilgrim all right. I saw it on your face back there in the dust. I saw it clear as Breasts and blue suede shoes. Would you like a drink?
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!	What's going on?
Sheriff, what is going on out there?	All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.	Okay.	Now you understand?	Uh huh.
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.	Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
Jamie! Get away!	Don't touch him Jamie!
Hi, Annie, Laurie...	Hi, Dad. What happened?	What?	What happened?	Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.	You blame everything on kids.	The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.	Huh?
You're going to be late!	He shouts, too.
Why didn't you wait for me?	We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.	That's not true. Here I am.
It's been totally charted.	We just talked.	Sure.	Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
Well, are we still on for tonight?	I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.	Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.	All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
What time?	I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.	Saving the treats for Bob?	Fun-ny. See you.
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.	I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...	Exploring uncharted territory?
Shit!	I have a place for that.	I forgot my chemistry book.
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.	Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
Look.	Look where?	Behind that bush there.
I don't see anything.	That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.	Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep!
He was standing right here.	Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.	Cute.
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.	The guys think I'm too smart.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.	Okay. Bye.
Hello?	Why did you hang up on me?	Annie, was that you?	Of course.	Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.	I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?	I thought it was an obscene phone call.	Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.	I've already lost it.	I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.	Sure, see you later.	Bye.
You still spooked?	I wasn't spooked.	Lies.	I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.	Probably Mister Riddle.	He was watching me.	Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.	He can still watch.	That's probably all he can do.
What's the pumpkin for?	I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.	I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.	Thanks.	For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.	What's this big, big news?	What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?	I'd say you must have the wrong number.	Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.	Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.	You guys will make a fabulous couple.
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.	Annie!
Fancy.	This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...	I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.	I can't.	Yes, you can.	He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
Wait a minute here...	If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.	Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.	He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
Get him out of here!	Here, Lester.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.	No, he's not.
Annie, Paul's on the phone!	Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
You locked yourself in.	I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
I'm scared.	Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?	I don't know.	Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.	I don't want to.	Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...	I want to stay here and watch this.
Yes.	Come with me.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?	Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
You idiot!	...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.	Totally...
I wonder where they went.	Annie probably took Lindsey out or something. Let's look for a note.
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.	And I can't keep you interested?
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...	Just answer the damn phone.	I can't. What if it's the Wallaces!? We'd get Annie in trouble.
Fantastic. Totally.	Yeah.	Want a beer?	Yeah.	Is that all you say?	Yeah.	Go get me a beer.	I thought you were gonna get one for me.	YEAH?
My parents won't be back till ten.	Are you sure?
We're all alone, aren't we?	Michael's around someplace...
I gotta go.	Will you call me tomorrow?	Yeah, sure.	Promise?	Yeah.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.	Lee Brackett.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.	May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...	It's important.
Ten minutes.	I'll be here.
Anybody live here?	Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.	They may be right.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...	Could have...
A man wouldn't do that...	He isn't a man.
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.	Looks like to me you're just plain scared.	I am.  I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
What do we do?	He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.	I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...	If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.	I'll check back in an hour.
Jesus!	You all right?	Sure...	Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...	You have the wrong feeling.	You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.	Exactly what do you need?	Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.	I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.	More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.	They could be.	I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...	I found the car! He's here!	Where?	Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!	I think you have too much to do tomorrow.	TOTALLY!	As usual, I don't have anything to do.	It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
I thought you were babysitting tonight.	The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.	I don't think so...
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.	Totally.
Hi, Laurie, what's up?	Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.	Is Annie around?	No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.	Well, she's totally not here.	They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.	Okay. Later.	Have a good time.
Hey, Laurie...	Hi, Tommy.
Are you coming over tonight?	Same time, same place.	Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?	Sure.	Can we watch the monster movies?	Sure.	Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?	Sure. Sure.
Yes, I am.	Uh-uh. That's a spook house.	Just watch.
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.	Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.	See you.
"...""how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."""	I don't like that story.	But king Arthur was always your favorite.
Not any more.	Why are they under there?	Mom doesn't like me to have them.
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...	Laurie, what's the Boogey Man?
Laurie...	I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?	After the movie.	What about the rest of my comic books?	After the Jack-O-Lantern.	What about the bogyman?	There is no such thing.	Richie said he was coming after me tonight.	Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?	No...	Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.	There was no one outside.	There WAS.	What did he look like?	The bogyman!	We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?	Right.	And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.	Promise?	I promise.	Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.	I saw him...	I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
Who is it?	Tommy, let me in!
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...	What is it, Laurie?	Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!	I'm scared...	DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!	It's the bogyman, isn't it?	HURRY!
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.	Was it the bogyman?
Are you sure?	Yes.	How?	I killed him...	But you can't kill the bogyman.
Laurie, you come with us...	No! Do as I say.
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?	Let's make more popcorn.	You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie.
I'm scared!	There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.	You're coming with us...	Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand?
Hello.	Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?	Yes, she is.	Will you get her for me?	She's washing her clothes.	Well, go tell her it's me, okay?	Okay.
I'm not responsible, Sam.	Of course not.	I've given them his profile.	You must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. Two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...	I notified everybody! Nobody listened.	There's nothing else I can do.	You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.	PROBABLY going.	I'm wasting time.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.	He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.	What did you use before?	Thorazin.	He'll barely be able to sit up.	That's the idea. Here we are.
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.	Are there any special instructions?	Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.	I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'	If you say so.	Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
Ever done anything like this before?	Only minimum security.	I see.	What does that mean?	It means... I see.	You don't have to make this harder than it already is.	I couldn't if I tried.	The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...	You don't have anything to worry about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.
Pull up to the entrance!	Shouldn't we pick him up?	Move it!
What did he say?	He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.	I don't think this is any time to be funny...	"He said something else. ""It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."""
...any sister talk?	Mm-mm!
Oh, good...	Come in, come in.	...because there are no interesting single men at this party!	Oh, listen...
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.	Mmm?	He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
I love that.  That's my type.	I can't believe it!
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.	I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.	Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crêpes caviar.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.	Well, let's hope so.
Hi.	Oh.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?	Are you really interested?	Yeah.
You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.	Oh--
What are your favorite buildings, David?	You want to see some?	Oh, yeah.	Well, let's do it.	Great.
That's just --	Look at this.
Yeah.	A lot of works.
Uh, who gets dropped first?	Uh --
Yeah.	And then, uh, April...huh?	Great.
I know.  It's terrible!	I mean, I've looked everywhere.
No, really, I really like him a lot.	No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.	Mmm.
We're a big hit.	Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Wow, it's the red one?	Oh, it's magnificent!
Oh!	Oh, is that what it is?	Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.	Right.	It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean.  I-I... I can't put it into words.  The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.
It's French, though.  It really is.	Yeah.	It feels like you're in France.
That's disgusting!	...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?	It's really terrible.
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.	Yeah.
Oh, geez, yeah.	Okay.
Well, I live downtown.	Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Uh...	It depends on what way you want to go.	Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.	Uh...	If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
Well, sometimes, some, uh...	I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um...
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.	Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.	Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.	Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.	What?	Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.	You're joking.	No, he called late last night.	I, uh, I'm very surprised.	He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.	And you, you-you're going?	Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.	But I'm seeing him.	I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.	Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.	Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.	No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Mm-hm.	Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.	Right.	Hmm?	Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.	Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.	And maybe my lawyer.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?	Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?	I can't resist.	Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?	Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.	We're actresses.	Is this your first job?	Really?  Is the food that bad?	Oh no.  Not at all.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.	Ah! HOLLY  Now.
You're Holly.	Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.	Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.	What makes you think we're more interesting?
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...	I cry at the opera.
Oh, what, what do you do?	I'm an architect.
Yeah.	What time do you get off?
Yeah.	It's terrific!
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.	Uh-huh.	And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite.
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...	Yes.	...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.	Yeah.	They fit right in together.  And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
It's really sad.	And it ruins everything else.	It does.
Yeah.	Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?	Fast.
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...	Well...
We could...we could do that.	Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?	Yes.	Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.	Oh, okay.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?	This time I really think I have something.
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--	You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...	Mm-hm.	...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.	Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--	You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.	Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
Now I ca-can't remember.	Let's take a look.
Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.	Really?!
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?	No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.	When did you first notice this?	Oh, uh, about a month ago.  Wha- what do I have?
You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?	Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?	And it's just in one ear?	Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.	The hospital?  What kind of tests?
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.	Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.	You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.	Like what?	It's nothing.  Will you trust me?
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.	Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space.
How ya doin', man?	I told him about your work, and he's very excited.	Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol.  And I got a Frank Stella, too.  Oh, it's very beautiful.  Big, weird...you know.  If you stare at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float. It's kinda weird.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?	Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.	It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.	Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.	Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
Hi, Dusty.	Hi.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.	Yeah?	I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.	Uh-huh.
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.	Well, are...are they big?	Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.	'Cause I got a lot of wall space there.
You--  Standards and Practices?	Ed Smythe, yes.	Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty?
Child molestation is a touchy subject...	Could you--	...with the affiliates.	Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!	Yes, but you name names.	We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
We--	...cannot go on the air.
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.	How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.	Oh, great.
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?	Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
Like, uh...?	I don't know exactly.
Yeah.	...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Oh, my goodness!	Oh, Elliot!	Hi.	What are you doing here?	Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.	Oh, what, in this section of town?	Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--	You're out looking here?	Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.	Ohhhh!	How about you?	Oh.  Well, I live--	Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?	Yes, I do.	Where are you headed?	Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.	Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.	Yeah, unhappy and fat.  And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.	Oh, God.	I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?	Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.	Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.	Yes?	Yeah, you would.	Well, i-if-if you have some free time...	Yeah, sure.
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.	Yes, it's-it's wonderful.	What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT  What?  Book?
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...	Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.	No, I don't have time.
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...	You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?	No!  No...	No?	Uh, yes!	Yes?
Yes.	Everything's okay?
Yeah.  How are you?	I'm...all right.	How-how's Frederick?
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?	Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.	Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.	Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.	No, I don't think so.	I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.	Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.	Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.	Well, sure.	And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
Well, thanks a lot.	Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.	Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.	And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you.
Page a hundred and twelve.	Bye.	Bye.
How's everything?	Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.	Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.	Oh, yeah.	But I go nuts.  It's a conflict.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.	Oh, that's nice.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.	Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.	Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.	Oh.	He's got like six gold records.	Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
Oh, you-you have that one?	Yeah.	Oh, I would love to hear it.
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.	Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one.
Isn't that beautiful?	I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?	Yes, he's just adorable.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.	Oh, right.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?	Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.	Did you ever read this one--?
Elliot!  Don't!	Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
Oh!	What are you doing?!	I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.  I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
Elliot!	I have been in love with you for so long.
I was looking for you.	I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.	Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.	Oh, don't say those words!	I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.	Why, you know the situation.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.	What do you expect me to say?	Hannah and I are in the last stages.	Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.	Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.	Not because of me, I hope.	Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.	Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--	Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.	Why?	Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.	But not over me?	Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.	Poor Hannah.	But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?	I can't say anything!	W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.	Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.	Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.	Yes, but you, you do care about me.	Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
Your guilt is because you feel the same.	Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
I thought you weren't coming.	I almost didn't.	Lee... uh...	I didn't sleep all night.	No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.	I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
This is not an easy situation.	I know it isn't.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.	I don't want anyone else ever to have you.	I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.	Oh, my God.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?	Oh, all the time.
I know she must be a really passionate person.	Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.	I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
You've been very cold to me tonight.	No.	Is something wrong?	Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.	Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.	Look, I'm just as much at fault.	If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!	I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
But it hasn't been forever.	It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.	Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.	Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
And you're in love overnight?	I care a great deal about him, yes.	Lee...	Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Mm-hm?	Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
They're fantastic.	Aren't they great?	Your sister is an unbelievable cook.	I know!  I know!
She has all the cooking talent.	No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.	Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
Great idea.	I know.	That's where your talent lies.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?	Let's go have dinner, shall we?	Mmm.
You bet.	Holly and April, thanks for helping.
Where're you going?	I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.	It's so late.	Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
Are you in a bad mood?	I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.	Was I?	Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.	Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.	Why not?	Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.	Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?	I don't know.	Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?	But, you got four children!	I want one with you.	Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.	But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?	You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.	Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.	I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.	Are you angry with me?	No!	Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?	I didn't say that.	Are you in love with someone else?	My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?	What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.	Are you?	No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!	What, you, of c-- What are you talking about?  Of course not.  I'd be destroyed!
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?	Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?	No.
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?	Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.	Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?	Leave me alone, can you?!
You matter to me.  Completely.	It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.	You're not lost.
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.	Get his wine away.	This is a toast.  You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...
I am... I did slave all day.	And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...	Yeah.	...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
Hi.  How's she doing?	I am glad to see you.
Don't make it worse, Dad.	Always.
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?	We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.	It's on the table, Dad.
Oh, Mom!	Oh, honey!
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.	How can we be happy?
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.	But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?	Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?	I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.	But why?  We raised you as a Jew.	So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
Why should I be afraid?	Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!	So?	That thought doesn't terrify you?
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.	I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?	Of what?  I'll be unconscious.	Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!	How do you know?	Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.	Mom, come out!
Want some coffee or tea?	No, thank you.
How about something to eat?	No, nothing.
Are you sure?	Absolutely.	Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.	I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.	You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.	Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with.
Isn't it enough that I can love you?	Mmm...	Hmm?	...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else.
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.	Mm-hm.	Have I really taught you everything I have to give?  I don't think so.
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.	Because he likes you.	Me?	Yeah.
Elliot lusts after you.	Based on what?  You never even see him.
...or films you must see or...	Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.	They're in the basement.
I don't sell my work by the yard!	Oh, Frederick!
What's the problem?	I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.	You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.	I can't take this anymore.	I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.	I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.	When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
Like what?	Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!	Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?	Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.	Why?	Because I have to!	What are you going to use for money?!	I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.	Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?	Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.	Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!	No.	Oh, yes, you have!	No.	You've been with someone!	Stop accusing me!
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!	I'm sorry.	Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!	I'm saying it now!	So you met somebody else?	Yeah.
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!	Who is it?	What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!	But who?  Where did you meet him?	It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!	You are, you are my only connection to the world!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.	Jesus...Jesus!	Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.	Oh...	Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.	You know...
In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?	No--
Look at this guy.	Yeah?
Oh, Jesus!	Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
N-n-no, not that.	Hello?	Like--
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.	But not you.	Oh, God!  Do you hear a buzzing?  Is there a buzzing?
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!	I can't keep my mind on the show.	But there's nothing wrong with you.	If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!	Well, he has to rule out certain things.	Like what?!  What?	I don't know.  Cancer, I--	Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.	But you don't have any symptoms!	You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.	Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!	It was on your shirt!	I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...	No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?	Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.	Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.	Yeah...but you're not dying!	No, I'm not dying now, but, but  you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right.  And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay.  I'm not going to go tomorrow.  But eventually, I'm going to be in that position.
You're just realizing this now?	Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
Yeah.  What?	Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?	Yes, please.	A week ago, I bought a rifle.	No.	I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.	Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.	Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!	I know, I know, and your hamster.	Yes!	Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?	I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?	I think they're fantastic.	You've outdone yourself.
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.	Okay.
Oh, great.	You look so beautiful.	Come on.	Doesn't she look pretty?	I bumped into your...
Oh, yeah?	He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test.
Hi.  Where's Holly?	Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.	Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
I hope you tell her it was your idea...	Why?	...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.	Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
So how are you?	Oh, me, I'm okay.	Do you miss Frederick?	No.	I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--	How are you?	I'm okay.	You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.	Y-yeah.
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.	Really?	Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.	Oh...	I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.	Like what?
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...	Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.	You are, Holly.  Stop it.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!	Oh, now--	She's going through a really rough time right now.
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?	I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.	Yeah?	I think we need to eat.
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.	I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.	Yeah.  I'll get some ice.
Hi!  Hi!	I know...I know.	Glad you could put in an appearance.	I got two minutes.	Very good.
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--	Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...	Huh?	...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
How is everything?	Everything's good.  Everything's fine.	Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.	Here, you guys.  Open them up.
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?	He's fine.	Yeah?	Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.	Oh!	I think he'll find that satisfying.	Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.	I think so.	I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.	Yeah.	The few times that I've met him...  Isn't that a great mitt?
Ohh!	H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...	I know, I know.	...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...	That's really nice!	...you know?  I, uh...	You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...	Thanks, thanks.	Mh-hm.	That's a beauty!	Isn't that great?	Oh!	Go right over there.	Football!
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!	Wow!	Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this.
Gee.	Is there no chance?
This is the second opinion.	Well, then a third opinion.
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--	Could you have ruined yourself somehow?	How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?	I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?	Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?  Jesus!
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--	Well, what about artificial insemination?	What are you talking about?	You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.	What, by a st-stranger?
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.	Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?	I want to experience childbirth.	With a, with a stranger?  With a--	Just think about it.  That's all I ask.
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--	W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.	Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
Hey!	...from Mavis, also.
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.	No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.	You promised to stay on the wagon.	The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!	Okay, stop being so dramatic.	He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!	Okay, okay.	Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.	Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.	Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.	Now, Holly's not shy.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.	True.	I'd have been a great dope addict.
What?  You're kidding!	No, no, we decided!
Perfect!	Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?	Oh, sure.
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.	Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?	This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.	Someday, I'll pay it all back.	I know.  H-how much do you need?	Two thousand dollars.
Uh-huh.	Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?	Yeah.	Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.	Will you just tell me one thing?	Okay.	Are we talking about cocaine again?	I swear.  I swear.  We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
Ohh?	Uh-oh.
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?	Yeah.
Don't you think she does?	She really does, though.
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.	I should get a garter belt.
Frederick didn't come with her.	When does Frederick ever come with her?	Tch.  He's such an angry...he's such a depressive.  I thought she was moving out!
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!	Oh, your kids are so adorable.
Oh, Hannah!	It's, uh, you never know--	He's such a loser!	He's not a loser at all!	Oh, he's such a loser!	He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.	Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.	Here.  Be careful with those.	Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
Ouch!	Oh!
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.	Well, how about this?	Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.	Oh, yeah.
He's married...	Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
Sometimes she's terrific...	Oooo.	...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...	Oh?	...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...
You found all this, all this out on one date?	Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.	Singing?	Yeah, can you believe it?	Really?	Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...	Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?	No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
Ohh!	You know.	I know, no--  I know.	I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--	No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that.
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.	Uh-huh.	Easily.
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?	No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...	Yeah.
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?	Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it.	I hope.
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.	What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?	Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.	Look, everything's going your way.
Hey, hi!	Well, I just came from an audition...
Awwww...	So what's new?
Boy--	They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.	Oh, what do they know?
Oh, gosh.	You got it.
Oh, God...	Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money.
Well, that...th-that's fine.	But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...	Well-well, like what?
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?	Yeah, that's clerical.	No.  She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things.
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.	"I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, ""Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer.""  I mean--"	Yeah, you mean not at my age.
You treat me like a loser.	How?	You never have any faith in my plans.  You always undercut my enthusiasm.
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.	Hmm!	I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--	Uh, losers!  All losers!	You're too demanding.	You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
You're crazy!  That's not true.	Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?	Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.	What's the matter?	Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.	Good.	Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
Hey, what's the matter?	I'm real upset about what you wrote.
My script?	It's obviously based on Elliot and me.	Oh, so loosely.	"No, not ""Oh, so loosely""!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?"	Well--	Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.	You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?	"Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. ""You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."""	You're grateful, but you resent me.	Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.	Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
Well, why don't you share them with us?	I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.	That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.	I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.	No, he hasn't.  If I offended you, I'm sorry.
Oh, why are you making those faces?	I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--	Listen, you are witnessing genius!	I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.	Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...	You want some?
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.	But, no, you've been doing that all night!  You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril!  Really,  don't, please.
Can we, can we go?	No!	My--uh...
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?	Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.	Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.	Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.	Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?	Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.	Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me.
Thanks for a swell time.	Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.	I was so bored!	Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!	At least I'm open to new concepts!	And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?	This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!	Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.	Yeah.  Me, too.	You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.	Right.  Yeah.  I had a...	God!	...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.	I remember you.	Yes, you do recall, right?	I recall you.	I was walking past and I saw you in here...	Yeah.	...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...	We didn't hit it off.	Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.	How are you?	Good.  How are you?	I'm fine.	You look wonderful.	Oh, no.	Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.	Yeah?	It was a terrible evening.	Yeah, it was.	Remember slamming the cab door in my face and..  you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a...
I'd never do that.	...in a really horrible way.	Oh, well, that was a long time ago.	You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?	People change...you know.	Well, I hope you've changed.	Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...	Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.	...namely a personality.
So how are you?	I'm okay.	You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?	Oh, nothing much.  You know...	Well...	...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.	Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?	Probably not.	Are you, are you out of work or something?	No, well...I've been trying to write.	Have you?	Yeah.	Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?	Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.	No, you can tell me.	Come on.	No, I am.  I am.	"Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, ""Hey, I have something I just wrote,"" right?"	Nobody ever said it.	Really?	This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?	Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.	No, the reason I ask is--	You've always hated my taste in the past.	No, I haven't.	You have.	I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--	I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.	You're kidding me.	I've done no television whatsoever. No.
I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...	Oh.  Oh.	...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But--
You're okay, though, huh?	I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?	Oh, I'm fine.	What...what about your script?  So what's it about?	Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.	You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.	Hmm.	Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...	Yeah.	...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.	Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.
Really?	So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.	Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?	Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.	Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.	Well, what about me?	Oh, well.	I should have kept going.  I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.	It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.	Really?	Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?	Oh, it just came to me one day.	Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...	Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?	I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...	Right.	...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.	Oh!	Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
Oh, God!	I am.  You-you made my day.	Oh, wow!	It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.	Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...	I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.	Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.	Oh, who cares?	Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.	Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.	Oh, yeah?  What?	That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.	Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.	It's all right.	I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I--
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...	Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.	Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?	Yeah.
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.	Hi.	Hi.  How you doin'?	Okay.	When'd you get here?	Just a few minutes ago.	Oh.  You look so beautiful.
Thanks.	You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...	Tch.	I don't know how you're gonna top that.
Mickey?	Mmm, what?	I'm pregnant.
Oh, my God.  Thank you.	I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.	At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?	Mm-hm.
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.	God.
Yeah.	Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.	Where are the antihistamines?
Dad...	Oh...	Dad!
Hi.	...which I did not get.
Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?	April?
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.	Hmm.
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?	Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Boy...Holly...Holly.	I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
Why are you so upset?	You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating.
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?	Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.	Yeah, well, what's your religion?	Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--	You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?	Take our literature...	Uh-huh.	...read it over, and think about it.	Well, okay.  Thank you very much.	You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
Aren't you glad to see me?	Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
I can't think.	...you don't have to think.	We have to talk about <u>money</u>...	I'm on the track of a reward, which...	A reward...	I'm going to tell you later....	A reward for what?	Some museum director disappeared.	And?	They're offering...	...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.	<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?	You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...	...I was <u>working</u>...	...<u>please</u>...	I <u>swear</u> to you...	...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..	Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?	I want to talk to you about your <u>salary</u>. Because I can't...
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?	I have not read you your rights.	Would you mind saying that into your bag...?	I hereby acknowledge that...	"And now I have ""dociled"" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience."	Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?	To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...	Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?	If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee.
Well.  Word gets around.	...what <u>hindered</u> you...?	It wasn't my day.	Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.	It's a poor workman who blames his tools.	Or, perhaps...	...how are things at the Hospital?	It's a growth business.	What have they got you doing?	Orderly.	I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.	I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.	You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.	Yes, I presumed it was about him.	...you...	I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.	I'm looking for...	He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.	Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?	"He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  ""natural composting.""  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?"
I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.	We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.	Yes?	And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.	Why me?	Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?	...very good.	Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.	...why?	Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...	"You said ""here's what <u>they</u> want you to do...""  Why?"	Now, whyn't you help us?	That would adversely impact my income.	Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.	We could skip the Gavotte.	Say it in English.	"Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his ""mind,"" do you see...?"	Then who's buying it?	"There's one or two freaks, and, for a ""<u>Pass</u>,"" I'll rat them out to you..."	<u>That's</u> the spirit...	...aren't you afraid of me...?	You want me to be?	I'd prefer it...  But it's just a vacant exercise.
"You said ""here's what <u>they</u> want you to do.""  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?"	Let's keep it to business, shall we?	...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?	...they did it for a lark.	Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?	Rich, comic book freaks.	And why is it a vacant exercise?	Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.	Who would that be.	Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?	No, you're wrong about Verger.	Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.	Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.	And have <u>you</u> found Peace..?
Bad beat today.	Hey, I'm fine.  Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...?
Evelda Drumgo.	COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
C'mon, pal.	All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>...
You want to get married...?	You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....	You're ready now.	I'm not.	That's what <u>you</u> think...
Then you tell me, then.	You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?	I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...	"And who is ""they?"""	...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're...	...the whole world's out to get you...	How crazy is that.	Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...	How <u>crazy</u> is that....
Hard up as you are, at your age?  Whadda <u>you</u> care?  Surrender.	"~Don't shoot, G-Men..."""
How you doin?	M'I gonna see you tonight?	That's right.	Then I'm doing fine.	What's new onna street?	All Quiet Along the Potomac...
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.	I know her by the Back.	...these guy'll back you up.
What, What, I can't hear you...	Are you <u>alright</u>...?	I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...	Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...	...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.	...he was <u>wealthy</u>...	He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...	...his family has offered a large reward.
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...	...would you excuse me...?
How was America?	Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.	...nightmare.	What's up...?	Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.	Yeah, so where is he?	Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.	They got that kind of money?	Their family owns...
What else did I miss...?	Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.	...are they hard to get?	Impossible.	...what a world.
Hold up a minute...	You spend the afternoon in Bed?	First things first.	You take this much time over everything?	That's why my wife adores me.
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.	Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>?
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?	Not with any certainty we...	Why did he come back?	Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....	...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?	...are you alright, sir...?	HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.	Seen what, sir..?	The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why? Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS. IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As Lechter will return back.  You see?  To the sight of his oppressor <u>wounded</u>. He will return to savage our beloved Miss Starling.  Bring me a drink.
<u>Do</u> it...	...Let's see the pigs, please.
Where was the call from.	Somewhere in Italy.	Make plans for Lechter's abduction.	...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.	That operation has begun.  Are we God, that we would <u>Meddle</u> with it...?  <u>No</u>, on the <u>other</u> hand...
...sir...?	Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
If you would see him monument, look around you.	Show me the Pigs.
He escaped...	Have the child taken to bed.
What do you want me to do?	Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...	Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
..It won't be long now, sir...	OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
He don't like popcorn.	No.  And...	I like Popcorn...	...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...	You give me whatever I want...?	Yes.  You know I will.  That's right.	Awright.
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?	The children...?	...they're from Baltimore....	I've never heard that he...	It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.	I won't take much of his time.	He's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  You Understand...
What would <u>that</u> be?	He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice.	Now, why in the world would he do that?	I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.	What reaction?	Exactly.	Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...	Do you know the <u>seller</u>?	We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.	Try Barney Clark.	He is...?	He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.	And how would you know that?	"Before ""The Change,"" Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study."	You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...	"....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after ""The Incident""..."	No, no, of course not.	...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...	Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.	...young boys, still...?	...here's to child abuse!	Mmm...	...and then, he'll be coming down.	You said the <u>bad</u> news...	Yes, I did.	I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...	"Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, ""release"" you...?"	I can make you rich.	And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men	Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?	..suitcase...locker...	Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...	...unmarked hundreds....	....what...?
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.	Let the girl go.	Why?	For a consideration.	'fraid it's too late.
Sir:	Shut up, Starling...	I could have acted on my own.  I was told...	Starling, I've ordered you to shut...	..I was <u>instructed</u> that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, ¥our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...	Starling...?	One moment, and they're at the <u>Seven-</u> <u>Eleven</u>.  They botched the fallback plan, they...
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?	...what's he got against you?	He once made me an improper suggestion.
Look at this:	You seen John Brigham...?	This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:	...what'm I looking at...?	A fellow with five fingers.	...standard issue...	Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...	Am I on that case, sir...?	No.	Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
Yes sir, I saw it.	We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.	I am all attention.	He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
I know you did what you could.	I'm going to work for your reinstatement...	Reinstatement to <u>what</u>?  There ain't nobody there...
Just a moment.  Starling didn't...	Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...	I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...	...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...	And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
She threw a punch at a man on the team.	Well, you know, that happens, on the street.	What is that supposed to mean...?	I think its meaning is clear.	What, you're saying she was overwrought.	That could be.	Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.	She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...	One moment, I'm not done with you...  Give him the file...
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>.	I don't <u>think</u> so...	Well, then, you have insufficient information.  I'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning.	You nervous...?	Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.	Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
....I didn't realize I said it out loud.	Said what?	I'm an orphan.	Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
Waal...	It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.	What'd you say, hon...?	I said sometime it gets so...	Well, don't you worry, cause that <u>baby's</u> gone take care of <u>that</u>.
Waited too long, hon...?	How's your <u>child</u>?
I said how's your baby...?	You want to <u>hold</u> him...?	Waal...	'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
Give it up, Evelda.	Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...	Give it up.	Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?	And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
My husband brought it to me from America.	A wonderful country...	You know it?	I have had many excellent meals there.	And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.	...should love to correct your error.	Well, perhaps sometime we...
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.	Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...	...how so?	...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...	And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...	No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...	And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?	That, that was <u>business</u>...
Of course, Commendatore...	Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?	I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.	I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...	...yes.	You have taken over his offices, is that not so?	It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...	Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?	Yes.  Packed and with an inventory.	I'll have them picked up.
If your duty requires it.	You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.	And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?--	You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.	Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?	Why did you look at me that way?	I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but <u>clean</u>.  Just dressed--in the middle of the...
I saw a man, somewhat <u>fatigued</u>. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In the middle of the day.  An old story.  And then I saw the clothing was <u>fresh</u>--therefore:  a man who dressed at <u>home</u>.  And then I remarked the new <u>wedding</u> ring.  And so:  the <u>story</u> gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A new, and a beloved <u>wife</u>.  I wish you joy.	You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?	I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.	...your <u>scar</u>..?	My scar is a war-wound.	How so?	Carpal-tunnel syndrome.  From a life of typing.  Commendatore.  <u>History</u>, a hazardous profession.
Yes.  How did you know?	You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.	It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?	I have had the honor.
And?  Then?	I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.	How could you know?	"I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is ""Hamamelis"" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?"	You know America?	...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  <u>Back</u> from America.  To your New Wife...  You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed.
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.	Enchante.
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.	Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
Darling...	Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.	The commissioner is going round the Cafe...
Who does not?	If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor.	I've left my <u>program</u>...	Take mine.  Ah. And is that your <u>wife</u>...  Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
...long overdue.	Back to <u>America</u>...?   When first we met you'd just returned from America.
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...	Yes, I think I amused them.  To what do I owe...?	I require...	...yes, yes, yes...
I'd like to walk home with you, and...	Yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. I won't be a minute...
...Franklin.	Where do you live?	With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean.
In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?	She my foster.	She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?	No.	Do you like it at your home, Franklin?	We got KittyKat...	Yes.... yes...	...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.	Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.	...who say...?	The government says.  Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.  The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  You can't see Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty Cat.  That's what the <u>Government</u> says...
Make them eat the figurine.	They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...	...tell them...
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.	Is it necessary to know?	Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.	Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
And you let her get away.	Sir, with all due respect....
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....	Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...	You were given backup....	THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...	I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.	And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...	No, I don't get you...	Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...	Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...	I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?	Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
...spend some time on the streets.  Ask me then...	Thank you, that's not responsive.  How did our Miss Drumgo get...
I came to pay my...	...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...	I realize, you're under a lot of....	You put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>TaskForce</u>...  Izsat the kind of Headlines that Preserve and Promote, you, sir?
...may be the heat....	Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
Can you walk?  Are your legs working...?	<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?	I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.	Spoken like a Protestant.
You look lovely.	"Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer ""I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."""	I'd prefer you to say what you feel.	What is that that smells so wonderful.	I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...	Thanks to <u>you</u>...
...I'm sorry....?	...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...	Indeed we were.	...and my need for The Institution...	Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.	And how did he do that?	He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...	I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...	...you have to <u>eat</u>...
Thank you, Cordell.	...but will that satisfy you?	Why should <u>you</u> care?	It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?

What're they on about?	They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.	Speaking of the Vacant Post.	Dottore Fanelli...

Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>.

I don't <u>think</u> so.	Then what brings you back?	I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?	Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.

Yes.	What does <u>that</u> mean?	I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...	Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.	If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...	...would you use a small word?	For approval.	What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.	Yes.	"How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, ""to go beyond the institution...?"""	I told that woman I'm an orphan.	...you <u>are</u> an orphan.	"But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to ""whore myself out""--"	Welcome to the human race.  Do you know, there are people who admire you?  Reasonable people.  Why don't you <u>find</u> them...?
Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today...	I don't understand.	"You said:  that you have ""decided."" That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a ""self- indulgence,"" and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job."	That's right.	"And you have decided to accept... to accept this ""emotion,"" as you put it, to the ... the ""sweepings. of the Lechter case."	Yes.	"And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.

What is your point?	That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?	I..	...yes...?	I want to do something <u>positive</u>...	You want some <u>advice</u>.	Yes.	"Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the ""Drumgo"" task force.  Play their game."	...why?	Because it's the game you've chosen. That's really all we have time for.
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...	That's when you went to the Orphanage...
And all he <u>left</u> us:  the Country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  An' that's what he left us.  That's what I said.	And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...	And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.	...yes...?	But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.	When?	But they were not there.  <u>Yesterday</u>.  Is that called a Delusion...?
For the <u>worst</u> hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.	I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...	No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?	Because we must leave the past <u>in</u> the past.    Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.	Because?	Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.	And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?	Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.	Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....
My encounter.	<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head.
...sir...?	Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.	I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
Believe me, I wish I knew less.  Oh, if you weren't such a pig...	I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.

No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...	Why are you...don't stop...why?	"""Why?"" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-""love""-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit!"
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.	Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.	Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...	Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...	But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.	And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.	That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?	Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.	Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
You think you're so...but you're just...	That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.	Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...	You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...	Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.	Did you wait until you were 18?
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.	You have no idea. Now run away.
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...	Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
Now what? What did I do this time?	I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.	Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?	No.	That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.	Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.	Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.	I'm not really a--Does it count if...
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...	They wouldn't be a bit surprised..

Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.	I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?
What are you doing?	Nothing.
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.	When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?	Geez, what time is it?  I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you...	I didn't realize I had to declare a major.	Why do you even like me?
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.	I'm not a nai-ive little...	Uh-huh.
You'll be hiding behind a tree.	The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.	Exactly. When we get into the clearing, I'll turn on my sexy moves. Wichita will go for it or he'll shoot me down.  Either way, you come away with knowledge.
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.	Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.
...sorry...	This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking!
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.	Yeah. And?	It's just funny...who needs a serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw when we have ourselves.
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...	Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!
Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--	We need more ritalin. Can't we just grind it into the munchkins' food?
"Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a ""time-out?"""	Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...	Yes, it does.
Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off...	I don't know about you dickweeds, but I gotta go take a nice, long juicy dump.
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...	Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...	Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...

I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.	That's bullshit. Just shoot.
Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.	Shoot.
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.	Ronnie!
Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.	It's not my style, okay?	Nice guys finish last. I should know.

Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.	Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.	You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.	I'll think about it.	Don't think.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?	Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......	Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
I was talking with someone!	Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
If you're going to openly be a bitch....	I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?	Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad.
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?	Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.	Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.	Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.	Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.	Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.	I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?	That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.	We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.	Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.	Geez, don't listen to them.
J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.	Never say never.
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?	Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.	Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?	No. Hell no.
You stupid cunt!	You goddamn bitch!
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!	Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.	Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games.
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?	We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.	Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.	Heather? Wha...	"Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing ""Kumbaya"" one more time..."	What are you doing here?!	I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.	Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia's so '86.	Color me nauseous.
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.	He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.	King David.	"Maybe when you hit maturity you'll understand the diff between a Remington University man like David and a Westerburg boy like Ram ""Wham-bam- thank-you-maam"" Sweeney."
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?	I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
Where did you get these?	Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?	What do you want from me?	Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...	But she couldn't handle it.
I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.	Very very. The photographs?	Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then.
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!	Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.	Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
Maybe you should see a doctor.	Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.	Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.	Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Guess who?	Heather.
Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.	Is she dead?	That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?
I said I was sorry.	You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.	You're not funny. Ouch!
What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.	Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.	Oh shit, yeah.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!	People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...	"So some people need different kinds of ""convincing"" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!"	Don't talk to me like that.	It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?	No.	Jealous much?
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?	Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
Veronica, you look like hell.	Yeah, I just got back.
What are you doing?	Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...	God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?	Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.	Give me the clipboard.
No way, no day!	Give it up girl!
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.	Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
That was seriously warped, Veronica.	Uh-huh.
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?	Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?	Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.	Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.	Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it.
Shit.	So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?	Suicide is a private thing.
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.	But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?	If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
Probably....	Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.	Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.	Sure.
There are no stupid questions.	If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?	That's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.	How very.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?	No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.	I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.	Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.	The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?	I didn't. Cherry.
Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?	I don't know. Should you?	"My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? ""Bringing every State to a Higher State."""	Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.	Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?	Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.	I don't really like your friends either.	It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.	Maybe it's time for a vacation.
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.	S'okay....	I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match?
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.	You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.	Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.	Killing her won't solve anything.	A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.	Well then, I'll pray for rain.	See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.	Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.	Just saying it's not hard to end a life.	There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.
I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.	I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.	Good plan.	But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.	Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.	Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?	Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.	Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.	Yeah, great.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.	Chick-en.	You're not funny.
Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup.	No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.	And your worst enemy.	Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
"What are we going to tell the cops? ""Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."""	Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.	I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.	It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....	Like a suicide thing?	Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.	I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
"""You might think what I've done is shocking..."""	"""To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."""	"That's good, but Heather would never use the word ""myriad."""	This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.	"She missed ""myriad"" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?"	That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.	"You're probably right...""People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."""	"""I die knowing no one knew the real me."""	That's good. Have you done this before?
Mute!	Next channel, darling.
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.	Yeah. Scary stuff.
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.	My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.	Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, <u>Dad</u>?
What is this shit?	I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!	Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee.
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.	Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.	You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.
Do you take German?	French.
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.	So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.	Incredible similarity.
Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.	Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.	We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.	They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.	Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
It doesn't work on small animals!	Oh.	Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.	You must have had fun.	You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up...
Perrier water!	Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.	This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.	Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
Did you miss him completely?	Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....	Don't move! I'll get him back!
Kurt doesn't look too good.	Remember he's left-handed.
We killed them, didn't we?	Of course.
You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.	I did not want them <u>dead</u>.	Did to.	Did not.	Did to.	Did not.
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.	Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
Your son's dead and you love him.	How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
Can't you see this is a special moment?	I was just making it more special.
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.	She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.	Don't <u>even</u> talk about that stuff!
You can be so immature!	You kids are making too much damn noise.
Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...	Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?	May<u>be</u>.
We're breaking up. I am out!	Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.	Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....	Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?	I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.	I could be up for that. I've already started underlining <u>meaningful</u> passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on?
It's over, J.D.  Over!	I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!	"""You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!"
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...	Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
You're still not listening! I'm not..	Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.	This knife is filthy.	What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?	I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless.
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.	You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
If you'll excuse me......	No-o!
I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!	Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.	You didn't say Simon Says.
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.	You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
How do you turn the fucker off?	You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.	The bomb, asshole!	Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?	You know what I want, babe?	What?
You really fucked me up, Veronica.	I thought I...you..	You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean.
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?	Veronica is into his act. No doubt.	Let's kick his ass.	Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though.
You going to eat this?	What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?	Answer him dick!	Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
We on tonight man?	I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?	Pretty weird.
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.	Let's kick his ass.	Cool off, we're seniors.	Goddamn Geek!
Is it sleeping, dude?	I think so, man.	Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.	Punch it in!
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...	Shut the fuck up, all right.	Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?	I guess.	Any contestants worth mentioning?	May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
You two....	Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?	May<u>be</u>.
You two....	Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow.
How was the funeral?	Superb.
Turn that back on!	This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.	I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?	All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized.
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.	Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!	But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.	What, the wine? I realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch.  Could we get some more light up here?
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!	Where is he? Where's J.D.?	We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.	Get a job.
"Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert ""Ram"" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope."	That's three things.	It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary.
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.	But my name's not...	People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.	Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.	Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.	It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.	Sure. Ciao.
"Mummy has a special technique called ""Deep Therapy."""	What's that?	I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
I adore anything to do with the arts.	We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.	Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.	I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.	Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.	Is that a fact! You'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?	playfully shoves his hand away.	I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.	sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
Come on! Sausage rolls.	Come on through.	and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.	Look who I've found!	whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.	pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.	Thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.	sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry in hand.
No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don't get fresh air or exercise!	frowns at Henry.
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.	Is it hurting, dear?

accompanies Hilda into the hallway.	breaks down into heavy sobs.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.	pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.	Bye.	Have a nice outing, you lot.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.	Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
Hello!	Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
Got an A, Mum!	glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.
He's the manager!	leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.	comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.	Come on, sit up.	I'm not hungry.	You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.	I just want to be on my own for a while.	starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.	You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!	holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.	Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?	Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.	But she'll have no one to look after her!	Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.	From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?	sighs.	Can I go now?	grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!	Well, I guess I take after you then!	whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.	You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!	steps back.
My name is Gina!	It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.	What does old Stew want?	She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.	Who cares!	I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.	I'm educating myself!	You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!	snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.	These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?	What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!	is very angry.	You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.	I don't wanna be in bloody school!	All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!	Open this door!
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!	Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.	I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!	You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!	You have to let me go!	stands and walks toward the door.
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.	Love, you can still write to each other.
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!	That's enough, Yvonne!
You have it.	Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
Look, Mother!	looks down at the ground in front of her.
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!	and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.	I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.	Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!	Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
I'm so happy to see you!	hurries over.	It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.	Thank you so much!
That's coming along well!	I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.	gives her a sympathetic look.	I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.	"They sent me off to the Bahamas ""for the good of my health."" They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands ""for the good of my health."""	looks startled at the outburst.	I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.	We don't want to tire you out, dear.	stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.	Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?
Hello!	Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.	Oh-what a nice outfit!	Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.	turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.	Fruit.	Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!	I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
Mummy!	Mummy!
She's terribly hurt . . .	Somebody's got to help us!
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!	It doesn't matter.	Of course it matters! It's Mario!
I think I'm dying . . .	Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!	Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
But, we're all going to Heaven!	I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.	Saint Mario!
To be known as He!	He . . .
Him.	Him . . .
This.	This . . .
That.	That . . .
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!	God, yes!
What?	It's so beautiful!	What???
I shall call him Diello.	You're such an incredible woman.	I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
You'll never guess what's happened!!	What??	John has fallen in love with me!	That idiot boarder?
How do you know? Did he tell you?	Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
I think I'm going crazy.	No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!	Let's go overseas . . .	You mean travel by ourselves?
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .	Hurry up! I'm freezing!	Just a couple more . . .	I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.	They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!	I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.	That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.	That was what we were led to believe . . .
Poor Mother was completely taken in.	Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?	Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
Poor Father . . .	Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
But that's not true! I've got one.	I need my sodding parents' consent.
I'm coming with you.	Yes . . .	I know what to do about mother.
Mummy!	Mummy!
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.	All right, then.
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.	Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?	I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .	I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
Bye, Dad.	Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
Isn't it beautiful!	Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
Are you a dream too?	Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...	What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.	It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?	Your wife...?
What's happening to me? What are you doing?	You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?	Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...	That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.	Your insight is enlightening.	No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?	Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.	No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...	You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.	Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?	If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.	Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.	I miss her. I miss my wife.
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?	Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.	I'm all over it.
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.	Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
Of course, yes.	The way you just looked at me...	I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?	All finished.
Hint. It's not a geographical location.	I'm stumped.	It's inside a moving car.	Bull...
I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.	Okay so... what's the safest place?
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?	Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?	Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.	Second most common?	Skin cancer.	Eighty third most common.	Pitbull attacks.	You just made that up.
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.	I understand, I think. Other women?	Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.	You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.	I did more then that.
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.	Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?	No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
Sure plenty of times.	Well?	Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.	Did I ever talk about the accident?	No.	Did I ever talk about Kirsty?	No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over	What was it?
Sorry.	If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.	I understand... I won't-	No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.	Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!	Just get better okay?
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.	Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.	Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?	Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.	Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.	Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...	Since what?	Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
Must be nice.	What?	Getting paid for doing shit.
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.	Yeah, how's that?	I have my connections	Really? Do tell.	Gwen.
GWEN?	I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.	You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?	Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.	What's the occasion?	I quit. Today's my last day.
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.	How much time off?	As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
So you're just packing it up just like that?	Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.	Yeah? You and who else?	Someone special.
Bret... what the fuck...?	Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.	Bret. What the hell is going on?	We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.	Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.	I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed.
Hello I'm Dr...	Ambrose. I know.	Have we met?	I've been in here before.	Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.	Where's Allison?
Who's Allison?	Allison Dormere. Your intern.
What did you just say?	I said she's been missing for-	No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.	What's the difference?
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.	I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
You could say that.	Zero's a number right?	As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?	How many zeros was your wife worth?
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.	What's that?
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.	Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.	Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.	How do you think you got this job, cock?  Mmm. I'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim.
What's wrong, Trev?	Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-	And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?	Gwen, my wife's dead.	Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
That was cold...	No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
Good boy.  Where's is it?	What?	Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.	Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?	Shut up and play darling. Your turn.	Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.	Uh... eighty two?	Eighty four.
You win! Okay pull over.	But... I thought...	If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?	I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.	You've been cheating on me haven't you?	Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.	Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
Oh my God. It's coming out.	What?	THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT! SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!!
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.	This isn't happening.
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.	In a word? Lucrative.	The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.	Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.	You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?	What?	Never to put you in my will.	Really? Why?
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet	There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.	Really, why's that?	I only married you for your body.
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.	For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
Kirsty... Kirsty?	It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
You're alive...	Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?	It's perfect.
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?	Where's my wife?	Okay then. Here's the scoop.
What evidence?	For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.	It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.	I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?	No please make yourself at home.
I thought you loved games.	I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.	You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?	Where is she? Where is my wife?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.	What?	The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?	Thanks.	We're all here for you Trevor.
Morgue...?	That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.	A little? Try unbelievably.	I swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me. I think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work too.
Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.	Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse, a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-	And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.	How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?	Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.	Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.	Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!	Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.	Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.	I don't work here.	Music to my ears.
Hey buddy!	... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...	Hey buddy!
What do you want?!	Who the hell are you talking to?
Do you know where you are?	Ambulance.	We're just gonna take some blood here.
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?	Two.	Can you follow them?
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?	Wow you are out of it.
Poor Trevor.	This game is over do you hear me?	I hear everything. And soon you will know everything. More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that. But I want you to think for a minute first. Think about all you've seen. All the clues you've been given.
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?	I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...	Use your mind for something other than numbers dear Trevor. Think about people for a change. People other than yourself. Like the women you slept with behind your wife's back. You were always so confident you had covered your tracks. Always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials? Part of you must have known she would find out.
What's under that sheet...?	You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...	What things do you think you've done?	Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back.
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...	All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?	But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...	Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
Dreams?	I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.	You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.	Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.	Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?	I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?	You can trust me. Your wife is dead and you need to move past that. And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it, not around it. Surrender yourself to your wife's death. Let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side. It's the only way you can become whole again.
Are you ready?	I surrender...
Wait... what the hell is this...	Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.	No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
-Tawny.	Whew. You bounce right back don't you?	What do you mean?
Last week...	The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
It's not that kind of date.	Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
Hey. Can I borrow something?	Uh... sure, Tawny... what?	You.
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?	YOU!
You okay?	I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.	Really?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!	I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?	God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease...
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?	For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.	You must have been very proud of yourselves...	It's getting hot in here.
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.	Well now there's a compliment.
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?	I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...	Hey you're the guy from down the hall.	Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.	WHAT?!
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.	Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.	A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...	Try stupid.
You got a drinking problem or what?	I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.	Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!	In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
You should give it to someone with only one leg.	One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?	I know a guy who only has one leg.
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.	They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?	"Hey, do I look crazy?  I don't go for that shit... interviews, media. They're manipulators.  ""Keep a low profile,"" that's my motto."
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.	LaPlante!	Come on, John, don't be an asshole. I don't like heights.
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.	Talk from there.  You can talk from there.	In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.	What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!	That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.	I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...	I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...	I was in the can, for Chrissake.	The bathroom!  For two days?	Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.	You should go in.  You're risking your life again...	I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.	Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?	What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.	And she thinks you're blackmailing me?	Right.
Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.	Huh?  Whadda you mean?	Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!	I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!	Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .	It was you!  I thought I heard...	I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.	Allen?  He... he's okay?
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.	You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?	Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...	Bernie.  Call me Bernie.	--but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.
You got it?  Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee...	And give a deposition to the jUdge.	Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.	On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...	You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.	I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.	"That's good enough for me.  You better take that ""letter"" there and get rid of it."
I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes.	Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.	"There was this kid there saying, ""Go in there and save my father, mister."" And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself."	Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.	So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard.  Everyday you gotta be everybody's hero.  People watching you all the time.  Waiting for you to make...  a slip.  Slip up.
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.	Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
"What's going on?  ""Guilty""!  What is this?"	I got your bail continued.	Bail, for Chrissake!  I'm innocent!
"""Anticipation of incarceration""?"	He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.	"I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I ""augment"" my income a little with some ""business deals,"" maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country."	I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...	He gives a good report and I walk?	We can hope.  You still have your job, right?	Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.	And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.	A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.	Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?	Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...	I understand.  How often do you see your son?	Often, uh.	How recently?	Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.	It's November.	She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.	I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...	Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
"""The Angel of Flight 104!""  You're telling me you're the A...?"	"""Angel!""  I didn't say ""angel,"" that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks."	Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...	Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?	I took a loan on my car and my computer.	You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?	I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...	That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!	Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?	"So you can call me ""naive,"" Mister LaPlante."	"Hey, you could call me ""Bernie,"" forget the ""Mister LaPlante"" stuff.  You are naive."	I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..	TAXI!  HEY, TAXI!  Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks.  TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.	You mean John Bubber?
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?	Mister LaPlante...	Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...	Mister LaPlante...	Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.	Mister LaPlante...	Look, I got this kid.  We got a goddamn relationship!  I'm takin' him to a movie tonight!  He worships me.  If I go down what's this do to my son?  I'm his goddamn role model for Christ sake!
Some guys been looking for me, Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.	Spanish kinda guys!	Business thing.  Gimme a seven and seven, willya?
What is it, five days now I don't see you!	'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.	My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.	You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?	Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.	You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?	I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
I didn't even know you had a kid.	"The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a ""wonderful person"" instead of an asshole, like everybody else."	We're all assholes, Bernie?	When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
Bernie, how'sa kid?	You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?	You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.	You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.	I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?	You mean like Bubber?  The hero?	Yeah, like that.  Same thing.	Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?	I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?	It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?	Nothin'.	I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.	The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.	Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
Bill, I...	"DON'T SAY ""BILL,"" BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY ""ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"""	I...	"YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE ""BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX.""  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE."	Bill, I got some legal problems and I...	THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!	Bill, listen...	OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?	Bill, I got financial problems and...	I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
He waited for you three hours!	You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --	I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.	Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --	It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--	Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?	He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.	Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...	The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.	"He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a ""war hero"" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed..."	"""Elliot""?  The heroic goddamn fireman?"	"I had to explain your tendancy to ""exaggerate"", How you were actually ""in country"" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less..."	Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...	Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...	The homeless!	How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important...	Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.	"I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle."	Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
You!	Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?	Turn that thing off.	How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?	How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...	What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.	Me!	If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.	The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?	Here!  Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks.  How much have you got, Chucky?  Give Mister LaPlante your money.
My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?	If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.	What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?	Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...	"""Harassed.""  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my..."	He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...	Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...	A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...	-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?	You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.	Underbelly!	In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
"All this is off the record, Chucky, because if John Bubber lives, Mister LaPlante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more ""misbehavior"" on his part.  What's more he's going to apologize."	I'm going to apologize to Bubber?	I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...	Lie, you mean...	Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.	I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.	Well, for your child's sake, show some decency then, rise above your sleazy instincts.  You may have already killed him!
I snuck in.	You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.	Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?	"Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The ""Scumbag,"" right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the..."	Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?	Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.	Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record.  Was it you?  Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse?  Why?
"This guy, this ""friend"" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?"	Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.	Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?	"""The Nomm""?  What's that?"	It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.	Were you in it?  In the war?	You never saw that picture, huh?	What picture?	Me in my uniform.  Used to be on the bookcase.
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?	I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
Here.  Get off here.	Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...	I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?	Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo.	JOEY!
"You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about ""truth."" Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?"	Uh, no.	Mmmmm.  Well, it's complicated. Maybe when you're older.  Anyhow, what I'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay?  It don't go no further.  What happened is, you remember that night I was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch, ..?
Uh, er... I...	You were saying you don't want a million dollars.	Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...	All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?	Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as --
Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  <u>You've</u> known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud...	Yes.	...unworthy of the adoration.  We all do.
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?	You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...	John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...	It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.	Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
I... I know that, John...	You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....	You did save my life!  And it's <u>me</u>! I'd be taking advantage of <u>you</u>! I'm a reporter, John, an experienced professional...  I...
I... no... I don't have the right... I...	No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!	Uh, right.  A... news story.
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!	Vietnam!	Goodnight, John.
You were... very... inspiring.	A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...	Read it.  It'll be fine.
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...	Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'	You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.	That's not what I mean...	There, like that.  Kind of, uh, sexy.  You can support me anytime, John.	Gale...	I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.	Bodybuilding!
It's not right, Gale...	It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.	John, I know all about it.	You do?
"""A little mistake""!"	No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?	Yeah, I got it.  Sports training. You learn to follow the ball.  How about you do a wrap-up from up here?  I'll pan off that skyscraper over there, find you here, then reveal the drop.
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?	I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.	Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.	Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...	You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
What's the matter?	This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
What is it?	The...Silver...Mike...Award!	This guy LaPlante won an award?	"""For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."""	LaPlante!
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!	And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?	"Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when ""good sense"" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?"
"It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, ""Newswoman Saves Suicide?"""	Unprofessional.	You just can't bear the idea of good news.	You're sitting on your ticket.
She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.	The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.	That too.	Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...	You said all the passengers were accounted for...	Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
We're piecing together different accounts and...	"A ""mystery guy!""  ""Not a passenger."" Who?"
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?	WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?
How'd it go?	He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.
He's right.  It's unprofessional.	If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
Saving people is not our job.  It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.	You wouldn't push the guy, would you?
Ticket!  What's going on?	She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...	A Silver Mike!  You're covering us in glory!
Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.	It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional. I love it.	We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...	What about a reward for coming forward?
"I thought they'd all go ""It's him! It's him!"" and hug the guy or something."	Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.	Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?	Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
Upset!  What's he upset about?	Said he's not an actor.	He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?	She's talking to him now.	We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.
"Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  ""Quit!""  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!"	Quit?  She wants to quit?	Listen, Gale, I know you're emotionally involved.  Don't be emotionally involved, be professional.  No, Gale, you are not a hardbitten, cynical hard-ass, you just think you are.  You are a goddamn cream puff!  Try and be a hard-ass!
She wants to quit?	She can't quit.
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.	Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?	Helluva story!	No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.
It's not unthinkable.	What?	The Presidency.  The public loves him.	For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
He lost a shoe!	Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.	"The ""unknown hero.""  They found his shoe right beside the plane crash."
My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.	You were in bed.  Weren't you?	I... I saw him out the window.
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!	Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...	"What's ""cynical""?"	"It's when you say, ""Everybody else cheats why shouldn't I?""  But I don't -- I don't <u>hate</u> -- him. I... loved him once, Joey.  Very much.  I just got... tired.  Maybe it wasn't all his fault.  He... What's happening?  Oh, my God..."
Oh my God!  Bernie!	Dad!
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?	Never reach out!	Hello, Mister Wallace.
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..	You didn't?	I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.	An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?	We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --	"""This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!""  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?"	We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --	Half the time he don't answer even if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause he don't want no bill collectors to find him.  I don't mean to be judgmental, but he's a scumbag. He don't have no friends.  Who's gonna like a creep like LaPlante? I was doin' him a favor on the TV outta kindness, and he screwed me. You know what color skin you get on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple! That's what color skin you got on the tee vee LaPlante sells me!
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!	I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.	Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous?	He's pretty... remarkable.	You didn't... get it on with him?	Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.	Reporters don't have hormones?	Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.	What about?	I didn't ask him.	Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants...	Who?	Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...	Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
You test each one thoroughly?	You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?	Safety?	Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.	How are they with kids?	They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.	So this really does the trick, eh?	Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle.  And God help whoever it is.  Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground.  Put your faith in that, pal.
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?	Okay.	I'm Bernard, by the way.  Those are cool Reeboks, Neil.  They're real new, aren't they?
Hey, c'mon.	They're really white.
Give it here, Bernard.	Whoa, check it out.
Was that your dad?	Nah, that's some guy fixing the living room floor.
So where are all your toys?	Let's watch some TV.	Where are these toys of yours?	A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.	What toys do you have?
Are you being helped, sir?	I'm looking for some perfume.	Any particular brand?	Well, it's for a woman.	Wife, girlfriend or mother?	Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
How's the new place?	It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.	And the rent is okay?	Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.	"All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an ""up"" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon."	Right.	And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?	Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.	I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?	Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --	-- hospital.	-- institution.	Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.	Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.	Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.	Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.	When I was a child... I got used to the closets.  The boxes.  The cabinet under the kitchen sink... with that persistent drip.  I used to the smell of the boxes. Wood.  Cardboard.  I got so I was comfortable there in the dark. Even... even that old refrigerator in the yard.  That smelled like rust and decay.  It was safe in the boxes.  It was when they took me out --
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.	You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?	Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.	That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.	I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.	As long as you keep remembering why.	Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.	The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.	I understand that.	And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --	No, no, no, no.	On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --	That would be stupid.	That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --	-- a sense of proportion.	A sense of proportion.
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.	Who doesn't?	I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.	Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.	Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.	It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.	Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.	<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.	I should.	You have to put yourself out there a bit more.	Right.	Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.	I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.	I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.	There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --	Well, you'll just have to <u>make</u> her understand.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?	Sure.	Well, can I make an appointment?	Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Oh, great.	Yeah, that was easy.	Do you do washing machines, too?	Just show me the way.
Everything breaks at once.	Isn't that always the way?	So, you're just kind of a roving --	-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.	Oh, that's fine.
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.	An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.	I bet.  Going into people's homes.	It's a living.
Do you have a family?	Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.	You must value your independence.	Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.	It's nice that you can make that choice.	I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.	Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.	Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?	Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.	What happened?	Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.	Uh huh.	Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.	Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.	It is tomorrow.
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.	I think we should talk first.
About what?	About us.	Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home.
I found a cent!	"""Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"""
"'""... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!"" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '"	'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.	Bye, Neil!
Baby, what is it?	I'm thirsty.	Aw, okay.
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.	A man scared me.	A man?  Was it a dream?	Uh huh.
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.	Why are you mad at each other?	You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?	Uh huh.	Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.	Did Daddy tease you?	Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!	Holly -- that's not so.
"""Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!""  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him."	Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
Mommy!	It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!	Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.	So you don't have anything concrete?	No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.	Have you just plain asked him?	I've asked him what's wrong.	And?	The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.	I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.	I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.	Don't drive yourself crazy.  It's probably nothing.
Rita, he's only twelve years old,	He'll never appreciate it more.
C'mon, kids, let's go.	"""We don't want to be late for our first day of school."""
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?	Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?	I could take a cab on the way home.	Here, take this out to the table.	But there's this <u>psycho</u>.  Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with <u>every day</u>.  I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.	No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?	RUDOLF!
He doesn't have a temperature.	I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.
Thank God.	I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.	Whew.	The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?	Thanks, Mom.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!	I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
Where'd he go?	He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
Neil -- what --	Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!	Honey --	Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?	No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.	Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?	That's okay, Mom.
Neil, calm down.	Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.	We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.	What?	You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,	What's that?	This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.	Stop knowing me so well.	I know it's at the high end of our range --	High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.	But it's what we want.	You wanted furniture too, didn't you?	They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.	You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.	You could have a pool to cool off in.	It's a nice pool, isn't it?	And it's a shorter commute.	It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?	Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
We're going to think about it.	It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
How were we -- were we cool?	"Paul Newman in ""The Hustler."""	Good -- that's what I was trying to project.
<u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.	Damn.
Did you hear that?	What?	Did you hear what he said?	What?	He made, you know, a remark.	Honey, are you okay?	-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.	Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.	I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.	It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
How was lunch?	Huh?	How was your lunch with Charlie?	Oh -- great.	Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?	<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
Do you remember who gave us this?	No.	There's no card or anything.
I hear things in this house,	All new houses have noises.	How long does it have to be a new house?	One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.	Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.	He's made some friends, hasn't he?
I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll get by -- he takes after me. You're too sensitive.	I know someone else who's sensitive.
Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.	Someone nice will find him if he gets lost.
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.	What next?!  -- A strange bra under my pillow!
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?	Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.	Well, what about <u>these</u>?  Do you usually put your <u>carbons</u> in your pocket, too?!
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.	I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.	Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!	"Do you usually pay for Charlie? At ""Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>""?"	Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.	There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?	Fuck you, Philip.
I thought we'd be happy here.	Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
The cab's waiting!	Where should I hide the car keys?	I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.	Did you lock the garage door?
Did the cleaning woman come?	Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.	Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
He wants to see me!	Philip!  The senior partner?	His secretary just confirmed.	Oh baby.
What -- what are you doing?	I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.	C'mon.
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.	He wasn't there.	What?
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.	Oh, honey.	<u>Everything</u> -- that I've been talking to other people behind his back -- that's what he called me -- a back-stabber and a deceiver. To him and to the company. He called me a traitor in front of everybody and told me if I wanted to be a VP over at Lowenthal I might as well pack up and go -- only <u>Lowenthal never</u> <u>showed up for our lunch</u>!  It's like everybody got an anonymous poison-pen letter or some --  Do you smell smoke?
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!	There might be some extras in the garage.
Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.	I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!	That's not the case.	Someone blew the whistle.  Someone hates me.
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?	This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!	"""Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going."""
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.	I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
Who was that?	I'm having the floor fixed,	And what was that neighbor guy doing here?	Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?	Look, I think we should work things out.
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --	There's always an excuse, isn't there?	I think it's time I came home now.	That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
What?	No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.	This is my house.
Oh God.	Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
Should I come home when I'm finished there?	We'll talk in the morning.
It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?	Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.	Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.	Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.	Just reduced.	Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.	This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.	Isn't it?
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.	Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.	How large is your brood?	Two -- three if you count the husband.	We must <u>always</u> count the husband. By my count there've been... four. But I still live in hope.
God, your sister's really hot.	Shut up.
Let's follow 'em.	What for, dickweed?	It's fun.	Grow up, Dreyer.
Shit!	Put it out, man!
Are we gonna buy this house?	Do you have enough money?
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!	Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!	What about cable?	We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?	No.
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?	I didn't.
Neil, do you mind?	Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.	"Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get ""Mad"" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!"	I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?	Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.	I have a cold.	What did the thermometer say?	The thermometer's broken.
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.	And I can't help having a cold.	What d'you want me to do, Neil? I've told you we'll get another dog.  What does EVERYONE want me to do?  You want to move back? Huh?  Would you like that?  Should we all just pack up again and MOVE BACK?!
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?	Can we keep him?
A <u>man</u> started the fire.	Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it?	-- A man.
Do you see a man?	No.	No man!  <u>Go to your room</u>.
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.	Get on the other side of that.
And this -- is the master bedroom.	Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?	Right over here.
Is it a king or a queen?	It's a double.	Even better.	Even cosier.	That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.	Thank you -- how efficient of you.
Promise?	Promise.
I'd like that.	Would you?	Uh huh.
Really?	Really.
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?	No joke, Lieutenant.	Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?	Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.	If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.	Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?	You can believe what you want.  You saw the tape.
Lieutenant Bedsoe?	Not now.  I'm busy.
Lieutenant?	What?  Who are you?  What do you want?	My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.	Talk to me about what?
What do you think?	They appear to be authentic.	Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?	Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
You didn't see this.  Understand?	Yes.
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?	Yeah -- how'd you know that?
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.	What is it?	A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.	Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.	The guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.
That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.	I'd like you to see this.
Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.	Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.	Tough.	It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.	This ties in with Nash.	We don't have any proof of that.	I don't need proof.  I know it.  Send it out.
Anything from the bank?	We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.	He had to come from somewhere.	I think it was England.	Why?
I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.	So?
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.	Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.	What?	Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.	You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.	It's circumstantial.
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.	I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
Detective Bedsoe.	Lieutenant.	Congratulations.
When did you get back?	A few days ago.	That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
Where were you last night around nine?	I already told you.  I took a walk.	Tell me again.  Where'd you go?	Central Park.	Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?	No.  I don't scare easy.	Where have you been for the last seven years?	Around.	And Brenda?
She was a good woman.	You didn't bring me here to talk about her.	No.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?	No.	You sure?	He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.	Is that it?
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.	Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.	Get outta here.
Good evening, Lieutenant.	No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.	I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.	That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.	It's late.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.	Maybe he was a lousy shot.
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.	Most people are afraid of death.
Yes -- I think it is.	Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
You'll have no need for that, Highlander.	Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.	Caution shows wisdom.
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?	Aye.
You?	No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.	We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.	Who are you?	Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.	I learned my fill from Romeriz.	Indeed you did.  And now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.	There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.	The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.	Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.	Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
Must you do that?	What?	Sing.	It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.	Can't you enjoy it quietly?	Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?	You?
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.	I hear you.	What else?  What else do you hear right now?
The river.	That's all?	Yes.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.	That is what bothers me.	I see.  You don't care about life anymore.
I'm leaving.	Leaving what?	England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.	And what do you think you will find in another land?	Maybe myself.	Then it's worth the journey.
Thank you, Thomas.	For what?
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.	I'm sure they will.	As friends -- always as friends.	We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.	That is a thought that doesn't please me.	If it came down to it what would you do?	I do not know.  I pray that I shall never have to raise my sword against one that I call friend.
You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.	The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?	France.	How long is the voyage?	Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?	Me?  Of course.
What are we doing here?	Living.  Remember?	You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.
To ask her to dance.	She's the King's cousin.	Then she should be an excellent dancer.
Yes.	What worries you?	You.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?	I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.	So, you do this for yourself?  What about her?  You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod.  You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen.  You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do.
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?	No.  What am I to do?	The only thing you can do.  You must end it.
Well?	It's done.
I'll go first.	No -- I will.	I stood up first.	That doesn't matter.	You always get to go first.
You can go first.	No -- after you.
It will be a good harvest this year.	Can you really tell from doing that?	What do you think?	I think you just like to eat dirt.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.	She's a treasure she is.	She'll soon be of age.
Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.	I know that for six months you've worked hard and asked for little. That you're a good and honest man. What more need I know?
This cannot be.	It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.	Agreed.	I would like to say goodbye.	How?
How comes it your are not afraid?	Would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.	And what would'st I gain from this bargain?	Your life.	How?
We had a bargain.  You promised.	I lied.
Aye?	Where do you go when your mind drifts?	Different places.	The past?	Sometimes.	Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.	Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.
I cannot stay.	Why not?	I'm leaving in the morning.
Leaving?  For how long?	You'll no see me again.
Why?	I cannot explain.	Do you love me, Conner?	Aye.	Then take me with you.	Where I'm going you cannot follow.	Why are you doing this?	Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.	Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?	Huge.	What are you hoping to find inside?
You guys are from the British museum, right?	No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..	Paul.  I thought we agreed.  No press.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--	I remember you.	I was wondering if I could talk to you?	Are you a cop?	No.  I'm an archaeologist.	What do you want?	To talk to you.	I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
Corpses?	Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.	In the highlands?
Yes.  How did you know?	A lucky guess.	I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?	He was wearing a bullet proof vest.	Bullet proof vests don't bleed.	You got me.	Why do I feel that you know what's going on?	Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?	If it's good advice.	This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.	Why?  What's going on?
Where did you get it?	It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
You're hurt.	I'll be fine.	What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?	Because it's my name.	Then who's Russell Nash?	I don't know anymore.
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.	Jennifer.
Why do you stare at me like that?	You remind me of someone I used to know.
I don't have any answers for you.	Who was that man last night?	I don't know.	Then how did he know your name?
Do you always walk around with a sword?	New York is dangerous place.	You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.	About what?	It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.	I'm interested in mythology.	Have you ever heard of the Calan?
No.	You look like you have.
Yes.	Meet me Tratino's at nine.	Why?	I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
Good evening.	You're twenty minutes late.	Sorry.
You didn't answer my question.	I know.
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?	Why?
I'm just trying to place you.	I've lived all over the world.
You're not an easy person to get to know.	Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?	How come you wanted to meet tonight?	I wanted to get to know you better.
That makes you uncomfortable?	A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.	Is it?	Yes -- it is.	Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--	--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?	Why don't you tell me.
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?	No.	Why not?	Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.	You don't really believe this do you?
Let me ask you something else.  At the excavation site in Scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  The day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  What bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.	So?	Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.	If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.	Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't?  What if they were trying to get out?
That would mean they'd been trapped in there--	--for three hundred years.	How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.	Not unless they're immortal.
Would you like to see it?	I've seen it.	On the back it has--	--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.	How did you know that?
It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.	You?
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.	And the other one -- he is like you?	He is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me.  We are the last of our kind.  The last of the Calans.  I do not know what purpose we were put here for.  I only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
Where will you go now?	It will end tonight.	Must you fight him?	He will not stop until it is over.
He's in there!	Get out.
Be careful, Conner.	Conner?
What now?	Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.	Sounds very -- normal.
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.	Where is the film crew from the British Museum?	They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.	Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
We're holding the workers down below.	Why?	Someone broke into the cavern last night.	What?  How?
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.	How could they get by him?	I don't know.
We found him this morning.	What's that next to him?	His head.  Someone cut it off.
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.	I don't think it is a duplication.	It has to be.	And this?
You stayed here again last night?	I was working on the cataloging.	Jennifer, there is more to life than work.	I know, Paul.
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?	I like my work.	I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.	We'll see.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?	It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?	I do not know -- and even if I did...	I know.  I know-- you would not tell me.  Loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me.  Oh well -- I shall find him.  Time is on my side.
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.	It does not come off as easily as the young ones.	Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.	This cannot be.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.	That's what the Kurgan said.	The Kurgan was a pussy.
Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer.	Why did you wait?	It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.	It will not end tonight.	You cannot hide from me.  You will not stand between me and my destiny. After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want.  Do you know what that means? I can become the President -- I can become anyone I want.  The world will be mine.
You know it's not safe here for you.	I know.	The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.	I can take care of myself.
It isn't over, is it, Conner?	No.	How can that be?	I don't know.
Is there anything else you need?	No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.	Me too.
Would you care for some water, Conner?	Aye -- that I would, lass.
Don't leave us, Conner.	It's not for me to decide.
Don't cry, wee one.  It's a better place I go to.	I love you, Conner.	Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.	I'll no forget you.	And I you.  Go now.  Let me walk to heavens door alone.
You kept it?	Yes.
What are you doing?	I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.	Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?	Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.	Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?	Fine.	What will you do?	There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.	Why?	I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--	You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.	My dreams died long ago.	Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.	I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.	And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.	If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.	Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.	Would you like to deposit this in your account?	No.  The money, please.	This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.	I can take care of myself.	Alright.  It's going to take a few minutes.  I have to call and verify the funds.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?	I think he's dead!	Don't shout, Larry.  I'm three feet away.
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.	That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?	The mother is in Florida visiting her sister.  The father works at home, so he's probably inside.
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.	Yes, sir.
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.	Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?	I guess so.	Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.	I will, Chief.  Absolutely.	Get to work.
Talley.	It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
What'd you find out?	The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --	Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?	It was stolen.
You get anything on Smith?	Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.	Keep trying.
The house is in flames, Benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.	Jesus Christ, it's a clusterfuck.	You wanted to let Sonny handle it.  I would've moved in when we first found out.
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.	Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.	I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.	What do you want to do?	Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?	The best.	Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.	I understand.	I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.	I'll make the call.
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.	Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.	I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.
You should warn them, Sonny.	<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.	He knows better than that.	Bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family.  Who's running the show up there?
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.	It's happening right now.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?	You think we should take that chance?	I guess not.	I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?	If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.	No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there.
Jen?  Are you all right?	She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
Who sent you?	Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
The car.  All you want is the car?	Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!	I'm going to my desk.	You're not goin' anywhere!  Get on the fuckin' floor!
<u>Get on the floor</u>!	I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!	You won't die if you let me help.	Bullshit!	But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --	<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!	You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.	Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.	Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.	Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.	We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?	Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
There's fuckin' blood all over you!	I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
That woman's gonna call the cops.	Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!	What if he's dead?  What if you killed him?
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.	We're on foot.  We can't get away.	We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!	Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!	We should give up.  All we're doing is making it worse.
I have to tell you something --	We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!	It's about Mars --
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!	Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?	I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.	You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
Jesus.  What is this?	Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.	Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?	That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.	That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.	Not if they're looking at something else.	Like what?
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.	I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
We're fucked.	We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.	There is no way out.	For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!	Celebrate what?  Going to prison?
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.	What are you talking about?	The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.	That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.	Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
It's over.  We have to give up.	Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.	That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
Then we might as well die rich.	I'm not going to die for this!
You with the cops?	The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.	We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
We're cool.	Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.	Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.	How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?	They're fine.
All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --	You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.	Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.	How about the cop?	Dennis?  I want you to release those people.	Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.	We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.	I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.	We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
Talley?	I'm here.	I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.	That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.	I'll give you these people.	The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
Hey, Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?	What?	I gotta piss real bad.
You're a funny guy, Talley.	I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
That you, Talley?	The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.	You oughta try on the problem I got in here.	I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
We been through that.  Forget it.	We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.	Okay.	Let me come get him.	Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!	If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.	You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!	You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?	Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?	Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?	I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.	Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.	Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.	Give up.	There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.
It ain't been a good day, Chief.	Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
Who else is here?	My father.
He needs a doctor.	Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.	Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.	All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.	Use more ice.	I'm getting a doctor!
What about my father?	Aw, Jesus, not more of this.	<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!	Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.	Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.	We're trapped in a house.
We can take it with us.	You can't run with suitcases.
That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.	Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.	Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand there.  And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.
The cops are comin'!	I got the gasoline --	We don't have time!
What the fuck is that?	They'll cut the power.
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.	Dennis.
You got something to say?	I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.	Fuckin' A.
You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?	I overheard him with the girl.	<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?	I don't know.	Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!
Can you identify this man?	That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.	Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC.  Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier.
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?	Keeps to himself, more like.	You have his address?	Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.	It won't be a problem.	He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.	Okey-doke.	We have to own this guy, Marion.  We don't want him dead; we need to use him.
Donuts here any good?	I don't eat junk food.
Are you out of your mind?	You fucked up, Glen.
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.	Give me an ETA.	An hour, tops.  Might be sooner.
What if it goes south?	What do you mean?	If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.	You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.	Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?	<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.	What hospital?	Canyon Country.
How did you get this number?	Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.	I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.	I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
What do you want?	My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.	Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!	I think you got no choice.
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?	Yeah.	You got ten minutes.  If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find.
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.	You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.	You said they would be here!
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.	Where is it?	Close.
All right.  Now the second one.	First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.
I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!	If you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.	You'd better be kidding.
I need to work out some stuff.	You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.	I still see that boy's eyes.
Can we talk some more when you get here?	We'll see you in a couple of hours.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --	Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?	The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.	But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.	You sure?	I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.	I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
I'm scared shitless.	That's okay.  I love you anyway.
Ow!  Shit!	Be quiet!  Listen!
No one's coming.	That big asshole nailed my windows.	Mine, too.	We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.	No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with them!
We can't carry him.	You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.	I'm not gonna leave you!	Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
You leave that gun alone!	Shh, they'll hear you!	Better than you getting killed!  Don't touch that gun!  Daddy says --
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.	I know.
Want one?	I don't drink beer.	Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.	What I want is to help my father.
What do you want?	We can't make the microwave work.
What?	We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.	How about dog shit?
Kevin left without you.	I don't know what you're talking about.
You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!	Kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
Now we can do whatever we want.	Stop it.
Please get away from me.	Mars?  What are you doing?
You gotta pee?	I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.	Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you.  Which do you want?
Thanks for the shirt.	Whatever.	Kevin, my father needs a doctor.	He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.	If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see that?
What do you want?	Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
What happened?	Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.	I can't go without Thomas.	All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.	How can we get out?	Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?	Yes.
Are civilians inside?	He said something about a girl --	Holster your guns!
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.	What are we going to do about Mike?	Keep your head down.
What's going on?	Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.	Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
Smith!  Wake up!	What are you doing?!  Stop that!
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.	Just one question.  Please.	He.  Can't.  Answer.
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.	Chief Talley is the one who got you out.	I need to talk to him.  Alone.
That's enough.	Another minute.  Please --
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?	Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --	Where are they?	York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
That's not enough.	What's that, Chief?  Say again.	Get everyone out here.  Then call the Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
Is something wrong with Jane?	We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.	It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!	His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?	Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.	Did he say if she was shooting at him?	He didn't say.	Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.	Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.	We only have eight officers on duty, Chief.
Louise?	Go, Chief.	Get a phone number for the Smiths.
Louise?	Go, Chief.	Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.	I know the one.	Tell her I'm almost home.
Chief, base.	Go.	I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.	You have her cell number?	She didn't answer.	They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
Did you find Jane and Mandy?	Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.	What's wrong with the radio?	Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.	Stand by.
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?	Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
Do it.	Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
Sounds like you know the job.	I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.	Maddox!  You got that?
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.	Order your men to stand down.
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.	Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.	If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.	Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.	That's why you get the big bucks, Captain.
He says that his father's hurt.	If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.	They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.	Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?	No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.	Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?
You want me to stick around, I could --	You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --	And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
I want to know what in hell you're doing.	I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.	I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --	Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!	-- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance!  <u>What</u> <u>is going on</u>?
Let it go, Captain.	Goddamned small town bullshit.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.	Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?	It's right in front of us.	Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Chief, Mikkelson.	Go, Mickey.	The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.	Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
It's mine.  Talley.	Chief, it's Mikkelson.	Go, Mickey.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.	Yes, sir.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.	Are all of you named Jones?	Don't be funny, Chief.  You can't afford it.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.	You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.	Don't worry about what we used to be.	How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.	What's my name?	What?	I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?	Special Agent Jones.	Think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.
What are you people going to do?	You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.	What does he have on you?  I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you?
We've got to get those kids out of there!	Not until the man calls.	Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!	They've been in there all day.
The kids are in here!	Where's the office?	Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later!
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.	Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?	Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.	How about you and your sister?	We're okay.	Where are you right now?	In my room.
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?	They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.	If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
Is my daddy okay?	The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?	I think so.	I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?	Okay.	I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.	What do you want me to do?	Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.	He has lots of disks.	I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?	Dennis won't let me go to the desk.  He makes me sit on the floor.
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.	I thought they locked you in your room.	I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.	Can you get into the office?	I can get into the den.  The office is right across the hall.
If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?	Yes, sir.
Can you open them?	I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.	Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.	Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --	Who is it?	Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
Are the disks still in your room?	No!  They're right here --
Where are my children?	They're still in the house.
I don't know what you're talking about.	He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
Did you find the disks?	Yes.	Then you have everything.  You can put them away.	A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.	That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.	How do I reach him?
Where's your gun?	I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
Who are you?	Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?	What do you want?	These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?	You can let go.
Marlon and Al....	We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.	I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.	You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.	You want . . . Marlon and Al.	I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?	These disks . . . where are they?	Smith will know.
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!	Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!	<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!	I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
I guess we each have something the other wants.	I guess we do.	My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?	Your phony FBI assholes.	We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.	What do you mean by that?	You don't want another dead child on your conscience.
Paul, Paul, a moment please.	Yes, Benedict, what can I do?	Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?	I'm sorry, it's a private function.
What happened?	They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.	We, who is we?	A delegation.
Paul!	Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?	Cockroaches?
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.	That's what I came to talk to you about.	Excuse me?	The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?	Leave it to me.
Also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?	Of course.
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.	I'll be back.
Who are you?	I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.	We are looking for you.
What is this about?	Let me see your identity card.
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.	Yes, it is a calamity for us all.	You work at the Hotel Diplomat?	No. I work at the Mille Collines.
I used to work at the Diplomat.	Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.	Of course.
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.	Where is your family?
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.	Let me explain.
Please, I don't use guns.	There is nothing to it.
You want to pay me?	Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?	How much?	Name a price.	Ten thousand francs for each one.	I don't have that much.
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.	How many in your family?	Six.
Ten.	And four children?	I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
Give me it.	I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.	You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.	I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.	You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?	No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.	We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?	Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.	If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?	Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.	Have you requested re-enforcements?	Yes we have.	What was the response?	We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
Paul, you know who this is?	Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.	Get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  Paul will look after you.
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.	Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?	I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver	What's happening?	They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.	Where is she?
Anything. Strong.	Canadian Club?
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.	Congratulations. You should spit in my face.	Excuse me, Colonel.	We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.	I don't understand.	Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African!  They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people.	Their people?	They're only taking the whites.
They fired a rocket at us.	Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?	I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.	That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.	Will you protect us.	I can't, I don't have the men.
What is it?	The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.	I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?	No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.	Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.	I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.	It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.	Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.	As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.	The United Nations are still here.	The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?	Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.	What did you overhear?	A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.	What did they say?	The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.	Watch everything? How? They are gone.
Satellites.	Satellites?	Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.	And what will they do with these satellites?	The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.	The high command? Our high command?	'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said.  I thought I'd better tell you.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us. What do you think would have happened? No different.	Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.	The police are very busy.	I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
He did.	Well rewarded Those were his words.	If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?	The front gate would be best, General.
I will see what I can do.	I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?	I am strong, Paul, like a lion.	I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.	You said you had no whiskey.	Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.
Where are my supplies?	I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.	You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?	No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.	Whiskey?	The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.	I'll be over.	Bring back your policemen...
We must go to the Diplomat.	Get in.	Your police are at the gate?	After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
Where are they going?	They can go where they want. They are in charge now.	What do you mean, General?	We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.	When?	Today.
You know what the Scottish call it?	No.	Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?	No, sir.	Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?	I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.	Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.	I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.	You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me.
We are better here.	Listen, you need me.
You are a marked man.	How so.	The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.	I am on a list! What list?	When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
You lie.	If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.	I committed no war crimes.	Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.	I led no massacres.	You think they will believe you?	You will tell them the truth.	I will do nothing unless you help me now.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.	Politics is power, Paul. And money.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.	Business is good at the hotel?	Very good.	I am always glad to see you Paul.
A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.	At least.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?	I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.	Beer yes, but no whiskey.	You have no whiskey?	No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. Anyway, I have bled that cow enough Paul.
What do you mean George?	Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.	) You cannot kill them all.	Why not? We are half way there already.
Let's go.	Take the river road back. It is clear.
For fuck's sake, Gloria There's a big news story out there! We need to get out and cover it.	Were not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.	Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?	We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
Satellite feed.	Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
Holy shit! Holy shit.	What is it?
You fucking see that!	Oh my God!
Here, have a sandwich.	Fuck you.
Lets go, Jock.	Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?	Youre drunk.
Great, I really need a shower.	Just give me a moment to get your keys.
The fifth room is your broadcast room.	Good. I'd like to book a massage.	Of course.
The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.	When will they be here?	Very soon.	Thank God.
There are no more rooms.	Give me the phone.
Mr. Manager.	Gregoire, what are you doing here?
Get out of this room and get back to work.	I don't have to listen to you anymore.	I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.	Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? If I were to leave this room, I'm sure I could find this smell. I know people who could cleanse it. But maybe it doesn't bother you? Why is that? Are used to this smell? Not me, I need a clean room to escape it.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.	Please, except my humblest apologies...	Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
Where are we going, sir?	For supplies, you drive.	The fog is too heavy, sir.	Just drive, Gregoire.
Are you sure this is the river road?	I saw the sign.
Paul, how the hell are ya'?	I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.	They moved you from the Diplomat?	Promoted. House Manager.	Good for you.  We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but...
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?	I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.	Can we phone them in, Paul?	I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
Perfect timing.	This goes out live?
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.	I would never do that.	I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.	Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
You are the manager?	Yes, sir. What is wrong?	Everyone must leave the hotel now.	Why sir?	It's an order. Get everyone out now.	I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?	The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.	That will take time.	You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.
Who did you call?	Call, sir?	Don't lie to me. What's your name?	Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.	I will remember that name.  Let's go.
What do you want?	We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.	The commander is not here.	He will be here.	Show me your ID
Excuse me.	What?	Our cards, please.	What cards?	You have our cards.	No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?	How much?	One thousand francs.
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.	They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.	I need a great favor.
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.	No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.	This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.	I will see what I can do.
Was there blood?	No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.	I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.	No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.	How do you know?	Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.	I will give you my house.
I will need a suite.	Of course.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.	Move? Where to?	I'm going to put you on the third floor.	The third floor are low class rooms.	Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.	Pack the bags, we have to move.	Also, this is your bill for the last week.
This time the Militia will kill us.	They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.	We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?	I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.	Your brother's here?	Yes, with Fedens and the children.
Thomas wants advice?	He wants your wisdom.	Let's have dinner first.	Of course.
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.	Homework?
Do something.	What?	Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.	Please, be quiet.
No.	We must do something.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?	I couldn't help.	You could have asked for a favor.	No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.	He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?	They do not have your connections.	"Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think ""Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody."" Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment."
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.	Jean Baptiste!
The president has been murdered.	Murdered! By whom?
Where are Thomas and Fedens?	I sent them home. Go and call them.	I tried already. The phones do not work.
Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?	They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?	Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?	Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.	They know you are Tutsi!
Please, Paul, 'til first light.	Dawn. Then they go.
Oh, my God!	Where are you hurt, son?
What is it, Paul.	Stay with the children.
Paul, don't let them die.	Get in.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.	What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.	What!	I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.	Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
This won't do.	It will do just fine.
Any luck?	No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.	I'll try.
Has Roger spoken yet?	No, Odette says he's in shock.	How can we help him.	He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?	Give him time.
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.	Please go back, bring the children to us.
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.	No. They are not dead. Stop this.
They are being evacuated.	What about us?	We have been abandoned.
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.	But who is left?	I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
You could leave, Paul.	What are you saying, Tatsi?	Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.	Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
Go to the roof now.	What for Paul.	Do as I say. I will be there soon.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.	So where is the lamb?	Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
What's the matter?	We're running out of beer and other supplies.
I have to go out to get food.	Go out! Where?	To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.	No, no.	I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.	You cannot go alone.	I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?	It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?	A kiss.
I have a confession. When we met...	In Ruhengeri?	Yes, when you worked as the nurse.	Yes.	I had you transferred to Kigali.	What?	I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.	Why?	To be closer. So that I could marry you.	What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?	It was substantial.	Tell me what it was.	A car.	What sort of car?	What does it matter.	I want to know.	A Volkswagen.	A Volkswagen!
I will not leave without the twins.	We have to get out of here Tatiana.	Please, please try one more time.	I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
A little longer, Paul?	We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.	Get on the truck, Tatiana.	No.
I have to stay.	No! Sit down now.	I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins.
Let me go. Children get off.	I will follow on the next plane. Go.
I love you. Keep the children safe.	Paul! Then another voice.
We are almost out of water.	We are almost out of everything.
We have to have a plan.	What sort of plan?	Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.	Please do not talk like this.	We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.	What's wrong?	I have to go to the Diplomat.
Oh, my babies.	Anais, it is so good to see you.
Can I have your name again?	Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.	Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena. Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over?
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.	There is one thing I need right away.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.	Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.	Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.	Why?	I can give you many political answers Paul but the truth is that Africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: French, British, Americans.
Rutaganda's place?	What's wrong?	Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.	You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?	It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.	That is why they call it coach?	Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.	You have taken business class?	Many times.
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.	Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
Twelve are dead.	How dead?
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?	He has taken the presidential suite.	What! Paul storms off.
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.	Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
What do we do with all these people?	Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
What are you doing?	The lieutenant wants the register.
Where has all our beer gone?	Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.	How much beer?	Many beers.
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.	Thank you, sir.	Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?	When?	As the trucks go.
What is this about no water?	It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
Paul. Are you alright?	We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
Out? Where are you going?	I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
All. What do you mean all?	The staff, the guests.	The staff and guests! How many?	Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
Paul, are you there?	Yes, thank you Mr. President.	Paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.	Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.	Thank you, Roger.
Why the hurry, Roger?	Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?	No, I don't want you going on the street.	Please, papa, I have a secret path.	Who is this Simon?
There are soldiers.	Where?	On the street.
Moses, Moses Seradungu.	Can I help you?	I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.	What is his room number?	I don't know.	Go downstairs, I will help you.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.	If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
"We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't ""believe"" in divorce."	Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.	Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.	I'm confused.	No need for divorce and that messy division-of-assets thing when they kick before you do.
Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.	You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.	Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.	And what's Steven's status?	Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --	"-- ""oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"""	"""But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..."" well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --"	-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --	"-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your ""demise."""	So what stopped her?	It's complicated. But don't worry --	-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?	Not yet.	So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --	-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --	-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --	-- bullshit --	-- the whole thing is falling apart!
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --	-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.	How much more do they need than your death at his hands?	But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!	And how the hell are we going to do that?	Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?	Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.	Not at all!
"Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it ""inspirational."" From some German cathedral a million years ago: ""Driving the Demons From the Mind."""	I'm moved beyond words.
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??	Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?	Problem? No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know, things to see, people to do?
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??	"It was on my Dad's list of ""things to do."" But the House did him first."
Jesus H. Christ!	Oh dear.	If you don't calm the hell down I'm gonna strap you in for electro-shock!
Looks like we're it.	More to the point. Where's our host?
Oh, for chrissake --	-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.	Yeah...something.
More the merrier.	No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --	"-- the ""Saturation Chamber."" Where he wanted to put me."
Don't think it'll be a problem.	C'mon.
What are you playing here, Price?	A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?	Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
You're not my list.	I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --	-- I'm sure you did.
There must be some other way out.	Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
Melissa!	Ms. Marr!
What?	Is she alright?
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.	Three times, to be exact.	Excuse me?	Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.	Can't imagine by who. I don't suppose the truth would interest you: that I've never had another wife but Evelyn.
Where is it??	I don't know!!
I'm sorry --	-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --	-- what was he doing here?	Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --
Oh, really: who?	Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.	I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.	As a tumor.
This thing's going nowhere.	If this is someone's idea of a joke --
Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --	-- fuck you!
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.	Yeah, me too.
-- I did: down here.	And I think that's case --
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?	I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.	You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.	I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
'Less the place really is haunted.	Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?	You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
You said that was an accident.	I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?	A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.	-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --	-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
What's in there?	Nothing.
What is it? What's in there?	The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?	Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!
"New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to ""normalcy."""	Did it work?
Hey! Where'd you guys go?	Left, goddamnit!
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!	Yes.
What's down there?	The...Fourth of July.
Shit, Pritchett!!!	Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.	How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?	What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Oh. Jesus.	Poor Mr. Price --
Uhhhh...	What?	Okay -- I'll admit it: I'm totally, clinically insane. But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight. It's yours -- if you just get me the hell out of here now.
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!	It's not going to let us out!
If you know where it is, get there!	Me? You've gotta be kidding.
Pritchett, is that you?	Up here --
Pritchett!	Over here!
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.	And we get this money when?	The second the sun hits tomorrow morning. Assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you're still alive, of course. Any other questions?
This is nuts.	"Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not ""comfortable"" with the rules, you're free to walk, anytime. Seven digits poorer, goes without saying."
I'll meet you down there.	Take the gun.
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.	Best of a nightmare.
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.	Prove it.	Prove it how?
Oh, Jesus....	Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
-- the stained glass --	-- yeah, we did that --
-- closed.	Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
Is she...alright?	I thought she was dead. For sure.
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.	I'm better than that.	Don't push it.
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.	Why?	This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit --
Thanks.	Most fun I've had all day.	You need to get out more.
What? Deep down inside?	Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.	I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --	I don't think so...	Why not?	Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.	There's always exceptions.	Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth.
Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!	No...not air --
How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?	Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here.
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?	An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.	And then where are we?
You hear somebody?	No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
We can do it...	Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.	It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!	No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --	-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --	-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.	You're starting to sound like Pritchett.
I was upstairs with Eddie --	-- that's the fact, bud --	-- where the hell were you?
-- you lose either way, Price --	-- listen to the man --
I think we should have taken a right back there.	Back where?
Good point.	Let's try down here...
What are you looking for?	Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
Cheery looking bunch.	Better living through electricity.
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!	Wait a minute... What are you saying?	Everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned. There are five of us...
Or an on-line computer.	That's crazy!	What about that other guy?
This is the best we're gonna do.	It'll have to do.
Price!!	He's gotta still be down here.
It's okay, everything's okay now.	He's dead...?
Don't think it's even an issue.	We're safe?
What --	-- was that??
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!	For chrissake give me a hand!
No. It's just trying to frighten us.	It's succeeding!	All the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there's got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn't just appear out of thin air -- there's got to be pulleys, cables or something, that make them go up and down.
Where did it go?	Run.	What --
You okay?	Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.	Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.	I don't do groups.
What?	Jesus!
...Jesus H. Christ.	So where's the party?
"I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack ""Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos"" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em."	You've got your own TV show?	The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream.
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.	Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?	I hope not.
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.	Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
Then what the hell are we doing here?	How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.	"Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: ""Haunted Hill"" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --"
Don't touch me!	I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.	I'm not laughing, Steven.	You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!	Haven't they already?
Could we have a word?	Oh, I think we're going to have several.
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?	Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.	I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.	Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.	Then who are they?	You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.	What are you talking about? You think I invited them?	Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?	It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.	"Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The ""O.J."" knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your ""Jim Jones Kool- Aid"" that was exactly that?"	All accidents until proven otherwise.
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!	Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?	You know everything you do gets me hot.
-- just not always in the sexual sense.	You're hurting me.	I know.
Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.	My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab.
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.	Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.	Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.	Really? Well, let it rip.	Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --	-- the sadistic prick --	-- in the act.
What are you talking about?	Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94.  Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find.
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?	Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?	A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.	Where is she?	Stalking the wild poltergeist.
Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?	Asking the wrong person again.	I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --	-- I pose you the same question --	-- and who's next on your list?	If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --	-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --	-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --	-- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
Jesus!	Question answered.	They weren't loaded when I put them in there!	Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
Steven --	-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --	-- what...are...you...going...to --	-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --	-- wit...nesses --	-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
No...	No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.
Evelyn... Get up... NOW!	Steven??
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.	Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?	Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.	You didn't think to ask?	I was in the middle of --	-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
You think this is fucking funny??	No, no, it's just --	-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.	What?	And here's your goddamn severance!
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?	Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?	My wife. Where were we?	"Your roller coaster that is, quote: ""unlike any that has ever come before it."""	Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?	And then what happens?	I think it's something better experienced then described.
Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?	I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
First time for everything.	I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
Do something!	Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
Please! Something! Oh-God!	Maybe if I --
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?	I can't remember at the moment.
I'm ready now.	Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --	Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --	-- my loss --	-- even if I give you a million as well?	Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.	Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
I think...I may have the answer.	What?	I remember...it was a long time ago...my father said: when the House was finally completed, make sure...we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne- that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere!
House 2, Guests 0.	"I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as ""ghosts."" This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --"
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.	Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
Vannacutt!!	Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
He was right! Pritchett was right!	I am.
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.	You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.	What're you talking about?	Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.	Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --	-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
Sorry.	Good way to get your head blown off.	I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
What is it??	Something with the power, I don't know!!
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.	I think I'll do what I damn well please.
-- the window and door grates --	-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
I was upstairs!	I never saw you --
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.	Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?	Fascinated.	I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
Well, I don't.	"Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the ""Saturation Chamber."""	I'll take my chances.	Well, I can't, sweetheart.
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --	-- confirming everything we already know --	-- I'll take the chance, come morning and cops, I'll be proved right --
-- listen to me, goddamnit --	-- no more --
Then tell me, please -- help me...!	Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.	Please! I need your help.	Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
Houston, I think we may have a problem.	Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
Problem where? Looked good to me.	"""Dummy 6"" keeps losing his arm."	So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!	The lockdown thing.	I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...	-- it wasn't me.	Rewind that.	I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.	Then who did??	No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!	It works.	Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.	No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.	Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.	Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War.
But the million bucks each, that's for real?	It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
Wish I could take the credit, but --	-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.	He must've beaten us all here!
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?	I can't comment until I get paid.
Oh, no.	What's going on?
Don't know that it does.	Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?	Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.
Won't do any good.	Why not?
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.	Believe me, we need to.	"Pritchett, this ""lockdown"" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?"	The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.	No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.	You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.	Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.	I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
Ghosts killed your father?	Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...	And you think it's in there?	Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
There is something very not normal going on here!	This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...	"Pritchett, what is this ""core of darkness""?"	I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?	Blackburn's dead.	Excuse me?	He would have been back by now.
Price!	Oh, dear.
Pritchett: what is going on?	He must've unsealed the room!	How, he's supposed to be dead!
-- hey! --	-- ten.
-- Eddie!!	Over here.
Please.....anyone....help me?	Melissa...?	For the love of God....please...?	Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?	Sara...?	Keep talking, I'll find you!	Something....happened --	-- I'm coming --	-- something horrible...I don't understand --
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...	You say you saw some activity here?
Damn it.	What's the matter?	These records only go back to 1880. But...  ...wait a minute...
Did you find something?	I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.	What was her name?	Colleen.
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?	It might have been her mother.	We don't have proof of that.	The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
They don't build them like this anymore.	Suppose not.
Town records are coming up now.	What will they tell you?	I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  And who died here.
I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.	Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?	No, I live about in Wexford.  It's about a five hour drive.
How did you meet Dr. Shea?	There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.	I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.	So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.	Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.	Yes.  It was.
It looks delicious...	Why don't you pass me your plate?
Did you find her?!	No!
Are you all right?	A few years older, perhaps.	How's your arm?
It will heal.	I'm sorry.	There's no need to be.
Good-bye.	Good-bye.
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.	That poor little girl.
Where does this amulet come from?	It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -	By killing them?	By freeing them.	I don't understand.	The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.
What do these ingredients mean?	Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?	Sure.
Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.	Well I bet you they're happy.
Can I do it again tonight?	We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
Don't play games with me, little girl.	I didn't do anything, mommy.	Well then who did?!	Maybe it was Colleen...	Who...is Colleen?
It's going to hurt us!	No it won't - no it won't!
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?	Yes.
Can you talk to her?	She talks to me.
She's down...	She's down...how do you mean honey?
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!	Ok...
My angel!	I'm scared!
Are we leaving mommy?	Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
Where are we going to go, mommy?	We're going to go someplace new.	What about all my other stuff?	We'll get it later.
H-how long will it take?	Go to your room!  Now!
Your father doesn't love us anymore!	What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -	I'm ok mommy.
She says she's lonely...	Where is she?	She's here.	Where is she now?	She's hiding.
She's down.  Help her...	Take me to her.
Help me!  Please!!!	My God, I heard something!
Can I have this room daddy?	Sure.  Did you see the others?	I want this one, daddy.	Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
What's he doing daddy?	He's blessing the house.	Why?	For good luck honey.
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?	That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.	Did you ever see a leprechaun?
Look daddy!  It's empty!	That's great, honey.
We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...	It's dark!  I can't breathe!
I can't move!	Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
Mommy please help me!	Don't be afraid!	Daddy, please!!!
Oh my God!  She's in there!	Daddy help!
Are we going back to California daddy?	Well, that all depends.
Good night Angel...	Good night daddy.
Mommy!	Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.	Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.	Yeah I'll look into that tonight.	I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.	The place is pretty dusty.	Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.	Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.	Must be...
What's the matter?	Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.	Oh come on...	I just, I don't know...	What will Aubrey think?	Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.	You didn't think much about that before.	Look, I thought we were all right on this, Maura.  It's over.  You know that.
It's just going to take a while.	Whatever you say.
To our family.	To our family.
I wish I knew more about her.	Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?	Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.	Or what she was worth.
God rest her soul.	I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  She didn't even know who I was.  It's just... tradition.
Are you playing tricks on me?	What?	It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.
What the hell is that?	I don't know.  That's strange.
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.	She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.	Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...
...set up some more things.	Ok.
The heater's here.	Were you fooling with the power?	No.	Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
What is it?	It was in the cellar.  Weird.	Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event -
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...	So what are you saying?	I don't know what I'm saying.
But do you agree with me?	Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.	Well what do you think it is?
Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...	Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.	There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.	Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.	Who?	I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.	Oh come on!	What about keeping an open mind?
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.	Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.	I'm being realistic.  Look, I have a spiritual side.  I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house.  That should count for something.
It just disappeared.  Literally.	I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
Whoa there...	Are you ok?
What are you talking about?	She has a...friend.  Colleen.	A friend?	You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
How are we doing?	I think everything's ready.	Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
Oh my God where is she!	She's gone!	Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
Aubrey!	Aubrey!
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?	You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
I'm fine.	Ok...
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?	Should I...	No.  You two are the most important things in my life.  I don't ever want to lose you.
You don't think I know?	Know what?
Do you think I'm a fool?	What?	Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?	What are you talking about?
Maura, what is this!	We're not going.	Not going!  Are you out of your mind?!  Wait!
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!	No...  NO!
Maura!	What's happening!
Are you all right?	I'm ok.
You're bleeding.	I'm all right...
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.	Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
We don't know.	I could see if I detect the presence of something.
I think we should do it.	We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.	What do you mean, unfortunately?	We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.	What about the other five percent?
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.	She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?	If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?	Before.
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.	Maura.	Maura.	Yeah, they told us this was the best.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.	You'll have to settle for turkey.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?	White meat will be fine...
You must be a Londrigan.	Yes, I am.
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.	Oh, that's nice...	May I come in?
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.	Did you know her very well?
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.	It was a shame.	In her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here.  She would call me, and I would come by.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.	I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
Your daughter's been taken.	What!
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.	Why?	The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat, then takes it -
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.	So what should we do, father?
Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.	Aubrey?  It's mommy.
Concentrate!  She can hear you!	Come back to us honey, don't be afraid!
She's coming back.  Keep talking!	Come back to us honey!
You must be the new tenants.	And you...are?
My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.	How can I help you?
What was she afraid of?	Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.	Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.	Thank you.	Perhaps I'll see you in church.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.	Good night.
We'll never know for sure.	Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
This isn't happening...	The amulet...
What...amulet?	Did you remove anything in the cellar!
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.	So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!	We must return it, if you want your daughter back.	What are you getting at!	I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!
How long will it take!	It will not take long...
Keep talking!	It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
The rain is letting up.	Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -	I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...	I didn't do anything...God saved her...	What's going to happen?	I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.	Yes, they are.
Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.	We'll be there.
No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.	Oh.
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.	And what would you do?	Well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.	So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?	Not someone.  Something. I've never felt a presence that strong before.
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?	Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
Where did you find this?	It was nailed to the cellar wall.	I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?	Runic?
Do you mind if I borrow it?	Not at all, if it can help.
There's something in there.	What?	There's something through that wall!	Well what is it!	I don't know!  Trust what I'm saying, we have to open this wall!
What do you mean?	I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you're made.
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.	Jesus Christ ...
C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.	Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.	Right.  Like last night's doozie.	I know what I saw.	And I believe what you say.  But this is TV.  No pictures, no story.
Not on station time.	No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.	Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.	Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.	You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.	OK.  Be careful.  And lighten up.  Story of your life could be right round the corner.	That is the story of my life.
Hello?	You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...	Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?	You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?	It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?	Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?	Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?	Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.	And what is ... this frozen moment?	The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.	And what did you discover?
Something bad.	And why are you back?  Why are we here?
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?	Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.	What will he do?  What does he want?	He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.	What can we do?
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.	I don't know ...
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.	Then tell me what to do.	This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.	So where is it?	Your apartment.
Wha .... ?	The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
It was off the statue.  In the club.	What happened to him?
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.	It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!	Where?
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!	Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
Uh-huh?	Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?	Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
You like ... left me a card?  At the club?	Right.  Right!
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?	I want to talk to you.  We met ... now, listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at the hospital last night.	Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... Look, I'll make a deal with you ... My boyfriend threw me out, right?  I'll trade you. You give me couch-space.  I'll give you talk.  OK?
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?	Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...	No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.	Right.
What?	Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.	Oh yeah ...
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.	What is it?	Why are you so interested?	Sorry.	No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.	Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?	God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.	That's great.	What?	No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?	I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them.
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?	I'm trying to quit.	Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.	It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.	Yes I do.  Terri, something awful happened to that boy.  I have to find out what it was.	But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...	Did you know him?	No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.	Taken what?	The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22	Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?	Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...	Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?	That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...
I figured I'd make breakfast.	Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?	Ha!  I don't know yet.  First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me.
I'll boil some water.	I'll do it!	No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love boiling water.  It's a specialty of mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?	The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.	Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old.
How have you ... ?	Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?	No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.	Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?	I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...	Who's that?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.	And he still sits there?	Every day.	Maybe he thinks it'll come back.	No.  He knows it won't.  It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
But I don't know what's going on.	Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?	Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...	Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?	No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.	That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.	Would you know this store again?	Sure.  Why?	It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?	Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?	What on earth were you doing down here?
Terri?	Buying some drugs, alright?	Oh, Terri ...
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.	Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...	Here!  Here!  Pull over!
What am I looking for?	God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
Joey ... ?	Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...	No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...	Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.	No.  We want ...	I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business.  I ...
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?	Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?	It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.	What else came with it?  Anything still here?	Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.	Can we see?	You gonna buy?	I don't know.  Maybe.	Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
Welcome. 38	You're JP Monroe, right?	Uh-huh.	And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.	Thank you.	Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.	It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.	A prize?  For what?	You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...	The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?	He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?	I'm sorry.	Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.	Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...	Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.	No.  Really?
Yes really.	Wow.  Thank you.	No.  Thank you.
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?	Unh-unh.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.	Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
But you gave me a rose ...	And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.	You shit.  Who do you think you are?	I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.	You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...	Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
What ... What ... ?	What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.	On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?	Yes.	Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...	No!  No.  It's not the same ... I ... No.  What you did ... it was ... evil.
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?	Fuck you!
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...	What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?	Because you want to.  You've always wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look at your sculptures.  Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you.
A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.	Hey, that's what makes the world go round.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.	But how in God's name ...	God?  My God was diamond and black light.  And I was his Dark Pope.  All that is changed.  A terrible beauty is born.  With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
How do we start?	It has already begun.
Joey?	Not quite.	JP?	Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?	What do you want?
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?	Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?	Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.	Really?	Yeah really.  I'm ...	No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...	You're apologizing?	Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?	Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...	I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.	I miss you too.	That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?	Yes. 53	Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?	Oh, I don't ...	C'mon.  It'll be great.
Not quite.  This wasn't here.	No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.	Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.	Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.	A girl?  Anyone I should know?	Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Yeah right.  Look ...	Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.	Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.	No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.	Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
Really?	Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
Oh thank God, you're dead...	It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...
You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.	Something like that.	Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...	Hudson, God's given you a gift for cat burglary, you can t just...
That was beautiful.	I laughed, I cried.
The security's actually not that severe.	It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.	Gum.
Eighth room down, babe...	Guards come exactly every three minutes....
That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?	Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.	Lousy day?  The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day.  What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant?  Believe me, it's overrated.
Looks like you've been expanding your...	Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.	"My next word was gonna be ""consciousness.""  Swear to God... tubby."
"That's your definition of ""Hard?"""	"Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  ""Come Fly with Me."""	Three minutes, 51 seconds.	Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--	Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.	Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?	Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?	Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?	Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu--	Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
"I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us ""Watering Hole of the Month.""  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper."	I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?	Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.
Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...	Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
Hmmmm.....	Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look at this.
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....	Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.	Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.	But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.	Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...	There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.	You're not...LISTENING!
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?	Rutherford Auction... that name...
Alex!	"Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  ""Witchcraft."" What's the running time?"
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.	Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
Cameras?	No need.  Guards' station's right there.
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...	Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
You got about five minutes and change.	"5:32.  ""Swinging on a Star."""	You know they invented something while you were inside.  Called a watch.

Did I miss anything?	Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.	Geez, Gates was killed.  Who do we send the thank you note to?
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..	"Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's ""Sforza,"" an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things."

At-tempt-ted!  I'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride.  Face it, when it comes to burglary, and sex, I...."
Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...	Why try?	Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.	You re not thinking of going to...	Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense.  Where's your tux?
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.	But I said I was sorry....	No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?	Don't act like you've never committed a crime before, Hawkins?  I know, I made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!	Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
We're going in from the ground floor.	Geez, this Art Treasures Room looks like a burnt diaphragm.
"Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was ""Who Shot J.R.?"""	You sound disappointed.	Yeah, I mean, come on, going through the Iron Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it's supposed to be strangling a guard...
Count of three?	Why not just go now?	Okay.

"""We all had our quarrels and parted..."""	"""But we'll be the same as we started..."
I'm a ghost.  Boo.	I don't want to sound immature, but we were here first...
Alex, are you....	I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome	You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there...
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.	Let's just forget it, I mean...	Get em....
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.	Too-do-loo, babe.
Welcome to Rome, sir.	Yes way.
My life is not some deal.  I...	It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
Welcome back to Vinci.	Last rites, sister?
How.	You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.	My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!	Ooh-kay...
Don't you just hate kids...	George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...	I call them the MTV.I.A.  Punks think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea. They think the Cold War involves penguins and...
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?	Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?	Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....	As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France, you gotta have French.....	Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference.
"Italy, France, Moscow.  They all just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do.  Man, Democracy isn't free elections. We gotta teach the world that Democracy is Big Tits, College Football on Saturdays, Eddie Murphy saying the word ""Fuck"" and Kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on ""America's Funniest Home Videos."""	Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....	Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is and in love.
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...	Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
What the hell....	You're supposed to be dead!
Did he mention the Mayflowers?	No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.	Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?	"That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said ""Polite conversation is rarely either."""	Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.	Yeah.  The big E.
Hit me with your best shot.	I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.	Anna, what are you trying to say...	He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...
"""Messed around"" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm..."	A little petting is not the issue!	Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.	Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?	I'm going to find out.	I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.	"I know, I know, your Eminence, just say ""God go with me."""	God go with you, sister.
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--	Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...	Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...	"No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of ""watch out, Anna"" would have done nicely..."	Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?	Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.	Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.	That's what you theenk.	Question, sir?   His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank.
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.	Never, why do you ask?
Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...	Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?	Could you believe that crazy elephant?
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?	Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....	The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.	Nice.  But right out of our brochure.	Oh, you read that.	Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.	You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.	I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...	God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....	I'll bring my entire repertoire...
And I'll bring my entourage...	Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.	Said.
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....	I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...	Prison?	I was the Warden?	How long were you in?	Let's just say, I never saw E.T.	"Wow, you were ""in the joint."" ""Doing hard time.""  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners."	I seem to have a thing for sinning. sinning.  Check please....
What have you been doing?	Uh....old badminton injury.
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.	Oh, I'm so sorry...
I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....	Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.	It's also been a long time for me.  I--
Catholic girls are scary...	Somebody robbed the Vatican.	Oh.  No.
It's not what you think.  Okay, maybe it is....	You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.	Wha--	What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?
"For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the ""gas leak"" that supposedly destroyed it."	Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!	The C.I. what?  God, no...	Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.	Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
Hudson, don't you understand...	And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.	I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...	Oh.  Well, what's this?
Where did you get this?	You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.	It's from the machine.  All they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already.  We can't let that happen.
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.	It's that kind of selfish attitude that...	Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...	"You re not ""some guy"" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I...."
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.	Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.	Fits my new image.  A thief for the masses.  This is one job I'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying.  Gum.
Oh Hudson...	I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...	Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.	This is too bad to be false.
I hope you know what....	Trust Leonardo....	Wha.....
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?	Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.	Wha -- you don't want to know...
I wanna know...	Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...	Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?	I got my planet back.
Way to go, Anna.	When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...	And then we'll arrest those greedy pigs... Is that it?
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.	"Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some ""neat"" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool."	Anna.  Anna.  Anna.  If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex. Now, get some sleep.  Kit Kat...
Cat got his tongue?	Actually he never told us what it was.
"How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, ""endearing."""	Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...	Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...	If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?	Baseball, why?
Good job, not pretty, but good.	Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.	Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.	That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.	Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!	Bunny, ball-ball!  Bad bunny!
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.	"Like a ""cat"", one could say."
No, let me!	I don't care.
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.	Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!	Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.	Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.	We're here to say, your government was right.	So let's get busy.  Have some fun and make some deals.
I knew it!  I told you it was a fake.	That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?	Million five, lover...
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?	You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?	Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...	Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...	"Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the ""Sforza"" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out...."	"If you're pausing for a ""thank you,"" give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?"	Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.	I guess that's a no.
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...	Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!	You want an address on that last one?
What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...	But you're going to tell us anyway...
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...	The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.	What job?
The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.	The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...	"How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying ""Soitinly."""
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?	Yes.	Remember that shoe you lost...	Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.
What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.	That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.	Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.	You certainly do.	So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.	For God's sake, chain this convict.
Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.	"You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but ""Alex"" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing."	You wouldn't risk the dime to call the police.  You have no proof.
Get away from there, convict!	Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Big girls don't cry-I-eye.	Two minutes, 35 seconds.  Damnit, I'm involved in this thing, so I just wanna know what this thing is. I wanna be treated as an adult.
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.	Alchemy.
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...	Jail, you asshole!  Our foot soldiers will blow your brains out!  Bunny, Ball-Ball!
Bunny, not you too?	You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.	If you think you're getting past me...
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?	It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.	Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?	"You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say ""How could this happen to me?""  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!"
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....	And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.	I killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover.  So don't play with me.
This is the worst night...	When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.	Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.	Tonight?  You're whacked.  The timing's off, I'm underequipped Damnit, I have a date!
Don't be stupid...they...	Bastard!  If you were a true American.	Just shut up and hit me!
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.	Too bad.
Don't I know you...	You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.	Bastard, you're going to need another nose!
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.	I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...	To what do I owe the dishonor of a reunion, you centrally intelligent scumsicle.
"I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, ""We've only just begun."""	Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...	Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.	Employer?  The president?	No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?	I'm supposed to fall for that?	Shucks.  Guess not.
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.	Why George, you big softie...	God, I miss communism.  The Red Threat.  People were scared, the Agency was respected, and I got laid every night.
Thanks for sharing.	We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.	If you do anything to my friend...	Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...	They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.	I don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie.
"I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say ""I'm just in this job for the money.""  Sad. Any last immature quips?"	No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
Why does this have to be so hard...	Tell me about it...
We'll call it the Flying Donut!	The Dancing Dingus!	The Jerky Circle!
Something short.	Sharp.	Snappy.	With a little jazz.	The Shazzammeter!	The Hipster!
The Daddy-Oh!	The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
The Hoopsucker!	The Hudswinger!	The Hoop-dee-doo!	The Hudsucker Hoop!
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!	What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.	He didn't look unhappy!
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?	We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --	I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!	Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --	Cheap! Cheap! It's never been more valuable! And I'm ruined! Ruined!
Who are you? How did you know who I am?	Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.	But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?	Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --	Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?	I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.	So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.	Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.	That smart?!	But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.	Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?	'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?	Well, maybe I --	An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?	It's hardly the same --	Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?	Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --	I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.	I'm happy enough.	Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.	I'm plenty happy!
...Hello?	Them po' young folks. Looks like Norville's in fo' the same kind o' heartache ol' Warin' had. But then, she never axed me 'bout dat...
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --	Adenoids?	Lumbago.
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --	Yeah.
About seven minutes.	Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!	He didn't offer you money.	A sawbuck!	Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!	On Norville Barnes!
Ol' satchel-butt...	I know they're gonna buy that stock --
-- and she's dynamite!	But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!	You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --	Muncie!
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...	Not at all. You're light as a feather.	The couch, please.
Hungry, anyway.	I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
What a horrible little person.	Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --	At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world --
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --	I myself --
Cigarette?	No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --	Mind if I join you?
You're from Muncie?!	Why yes, do you know it?
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.	Oh, no, really, I --	Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?	Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!	Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --	Please! Norville!
...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?	Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.	The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --	-- or lack thereof?	-- these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely, et cetera.
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?	...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?	I'm sure I --	Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.	Well, I --	Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
...You know! For kids!	...Why don't I just type this up...	Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.	Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.	Well, she probably had a deadline...	Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!	Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam...
Confused?	Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.	I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.	Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.	Oh, is that it!	Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...	Smitty.	Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?	Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.	I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
...What happened?	Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.	Let me look.
Sid found me the icepack.	Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.	Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.	...I'm sorry.	Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.	I know that, Amy.	...You do?	I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.	I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --	Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --	Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
...Certain people are --	Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?	...Huh?	You know, on farm route 17.	Oh yes! In Muncie!	No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!	Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.	You don't say.	Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.	Every year?	Well -- this year -- if it's good I plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful --
...The people look like ants.	Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.	What a beautiful thought.	What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?	Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --	Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.	Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --	That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...	I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.	Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.	That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Oh, Norville --	Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!	Sure, Norville, sure...
For Pete's sake, Norville!	Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --	Never mind about that...
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?	Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --	They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --	Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --	You mean you know about this?	Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.	Your i --	We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --	You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --	Now, Aim --	Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --	Now, Aim --	Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --	Now, Aim --	Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...	Worked in a watch factory?
Now, Amy --	Consider this my resignation --
...You son of a --	Norville!	Huh?!
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!	Oh Norville, I --
Barman! Set'm up, fella!	Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --	Hey! Where's that martini?!	Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --	Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!	Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
I tell ya the guy's a phony.	Phony, huh?	As a three-dollar bill.	Sez who?	Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.	Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?	I filed it yesterday.	Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
I can't print this!	Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!	It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?	I don't know...
Muncie.	Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.	I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.	Watch it, Archer --	It's about a dimwitted editor who --
You can't print that!	He grins wolfishly.
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --	Says who?!
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --	You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!	Amy -- take a break. You've worked hard on this story -- heck, you broke it for us! But it's passed you by and Smith here has taken up the slack.
Just got hired today!	Terrific.	Ya know, entry level!	Tell me about it.	I got big ideas, though!	I'm sure you do.	For instance, take a look at this sweet baby...
Terrific.	So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.	Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
How long've you been down here?	Forty-eight years...
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!	Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --	I thought you served misfits here!
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.	What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!	It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --	I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --	Martinis are for squares, man.
What the heck's she doin', Lou?	What the heck they doin'?
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.	This I know, Benny.	This you're familia' with.
...Geez.	...Geez.
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.	It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?	Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --	Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?	I --	Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy!
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?	Well, I --	Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!
My pleasure, sir.	Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?	I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
...Why, this is worthless.	Huh?! But, buddy --
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!	Yeah, but, buddy --	Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...
...say, the hula hoop such a success.	But, buddy --	And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --	But, buddy, you were --	-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!	Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --	An example must be made!
Wuddya mean, buddy?	Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
Awwww, buddy --	And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!	Get up!	I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!	We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...	Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --	Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
...You don't?	Nah, that's all forgotten.	...It is?	Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.	Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --	But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!	But, Buzz --	Say, that was a swell idea!	But, Buzz, you know I never --	And Sid says you stole it!	But Buzz --
...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?	Norville.	Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.	Yes sir...	Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.	Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --	It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.
Oh, geez.	Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.	Geez, I --	Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.	Yessir.	Well, why don't ya read it.	Sir?	Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.	Yes sir...
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '	Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.	'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'	-- tough titty toenails!
...Yeah, go ahead.	'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
...This'll only take a moment.	Yeah?	Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --	Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
...Well, I'm not sure where I --	I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!	But look, I'm president of the company now and I --	I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!	That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.	Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I was in bed for a week! Positively sick with fury! I called in the gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez, either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee!
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?	I haven't had --	Sidney and I are planning a trip to Paris and points continental -- Aren't we, dear?
Well, frankly, I...	You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
...Who let you in?	I --
Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?	I --
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.	You --
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --	Wait a minute!
...education, were you?	Well, I'm a college graduate --	All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?	Well, I made the dean's list.	Hmmm.
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.	Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?	No, sir.	Not even behind your back?	Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!	You're fired.	But, sir! --	Get your feet off that desk.
But --	Get out of my sight.
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!	Oh my God, sir!
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!	Oh my God, sir!
Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!	Oh my God, sir!
Not that way! Through the door!	But, sir!
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!	Sir, my leg is on fire!
My God! The Bumstead contracts!	Oh my God, sir!
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--	Lobby. We haven't got all day.
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.	Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?	I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!	Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --	Damnit, where's my car!	-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
Finally.	-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.	Well... I'm for it...
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.	Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.	Ya don't say.	Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.	How's that, Sid?	It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --	Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --	Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
I got gas, Bennie.	Yeah, tell me about it.	No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.	Ya get the special?	Fah from it...
...Enter the dame.	There's one in every story.	Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.	Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.	She's looking for her mark.
She finds him.	She sits down.
...and awduhs a light lunch.	She looks in her purse...
...No money.	The mark notices.
...He's not noticing, Benny.	Maybe he's wise.	He don't look wise.	Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
Yellowstone.	Old Faithful.	Hello, Niagara.	He notices.
She's got other problems, of course...	...Her mother needs an operation...	...adenoids.	No, Bennie: Lumbago.
Maybe he's wise.	He don't look wise.
She isn't!	She is!
She's good, Bennie.	She's damn good, Lou.
Good morning, miss.	Thank you for waking me.	I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, Miss.  That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.	I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.	Thank you, Alma.
Miss Jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed, with a lacy cushion to bank her head up. If you'd only seen her, Miss Connell. She looked so pretty.	She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?	She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.	We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.	I do my best.  Every day I dress her just as beautifully as if she was well.  It's just like dressing a great, big doll.
What's this?	"A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says ""brioche."""	Looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.	Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.	Doctors that are people can't cure everything.	"What do you mean -- ""doctors that are people""?"	There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...	Where?	At the Houmfort.	That's nonsense, Alma.	They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.	You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?	No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.	Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?	Yes, Miss Betsy.  I mean that.  The Houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to Shango and Damballa.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.	Ti-Misery?  What's that?	A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.	Alive?	No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.	You mean a figurehead.	If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.	But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?	If you say, miss.  If you say.
I think you need some help.	I'm afraid so.	Ti-Joseph?
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.	Oh, Mrs. Rand --	Come, come, don't tell me how sorry you are that I should meet you this way.  I'm even a little glad that Wesley's difficulty brought us together.
Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --	Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me.
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.	So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
I'd love to.	Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.	I've no influence with Mr. Holland.	Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.	You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.	Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.	You don't believe in it?	A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?	I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?	Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?	"I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been ""mindless""..."	Her son drowned.  She brooded until her mind was affected. All the Houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
Mrs. Rand.	Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.	But, Mrs. Rand --	I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.	But how did you get here? What are you doing here?	I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.	But you didn't have to come up here.	Perhaps not.  But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started, it seemed such an easy way to do good.  I should have known there was no easy way to do good, Betsy.
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.	That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
Mrs. Rand...	You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.	Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  She's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people,  to help them.
Does she suffer?	I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
She can never be cured?	I've never heard of a cure.	Is this disease common in the tropics?	Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.	Thank you.
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.	It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.	I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
You're single?	Yes.	Where were you trained?	At the Memorial Hospital -- here in Ottawa.
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.	Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.	That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.	I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.	That will mean another interview, won't it?	No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.	The West Indies?	A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.	But it's so far away...	That's rather nice, isn't it?
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.	Yes -- on the boat.	And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.	Is she a doctor?	No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.	I like her already.	And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.	Thank you.  But who sits there?	My brother's wife.
-- But, you're an American?	I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.	I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.	We're half-brothers.  Paul is mother's first child.  When his father died, she married my father. Dr. Rand, the missionary.  And you know what they say about missionaries' children.
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.	Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.	Mr. Holland?	Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.	I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.	Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.	It'll wait.
Where do you think you're going?	It's my day off.	But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?	I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?	Well -- and things -- might be a better description of what you'll find.  I'd better come along and show you the town.
But don't you have to work?	By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.	It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.	What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?	Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.	How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?	I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --	Wait. I want to listen.
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.	Did you hear what he sang?
I wish I hadn't heard --	Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.	That doesn't sound like him.	That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.	I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?	"One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  ""You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?""  What he could do to that word ""beautiful."" That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists."
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?	Of course, Wes.
Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?	I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.	She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...	Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.	But she's not dead, Wes.	You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!	Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
No, Wes.	Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
It is not beautiful.	You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.	It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.	You can't really believe that.
Have the servants made you comfortable?	Yes, thank you.
Can't I take it for you?	No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
I heard someone crying -- a woman --	A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
Why was the maid crying?	I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?	A figure of St. Sebastian.	Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.	I am not a frightened girl.	That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.	If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.	And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?	Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --	Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?	Of course not!
A mental case?	I'm sorry...	Why should you be?  My wife is a mental case.  Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about Zombies.
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?	Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---	Many people thought her beautiful.
I suppose so.  Yes.	And charming?	I've never given it much thought.	Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
Good morning, Miss Connell.	Good morning.
"I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first ""day off,"" too."	Well, I had a good time up to a point.	Wesley can be very entertaining.	Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --	It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.	But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.	I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.	Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.	I'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is.  I engaged you, Miss Connell, to take care of my wife, not my brother.
You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.	I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.
I heard you playing.	I often do.	I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.	Why did you come in here?	I don't know.  I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.	I love Fort Holland.	What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?	You didn't drive her mad.	Didn't I?  I don't know.  That's the simple truth of it.  I don't know.
Well?	She is alive, Mr. Holland -- that's all.
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.	I imagined this so differently...
"I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, ""Paul, darling...""  The whole thing beginning all over again..."	And instead,  I came -- bringing you nothing.	Instead -- you come, with sympathy, Betsy, and a generous heart. Don't forget that.  Don't call it nothing.
I wanted to help you.	Help me? How?	I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.	You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?	I told you.	Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?	You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.	What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
You think I love Jessica and want her back. It is like you to think that -- clean, decent thinking.	She was beautiful.	I hated her.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.	I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.	You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.	How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.	I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.	No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
You wanted to warn me...	The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.	Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.	I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.	That's past -- that's over and done with...	I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.	You want that?	Yes.
Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.	I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.	This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.	I'm quite sure nothing will happen, Doctor.
Wesley!	I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.	It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?	I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.	Ah -- that's where reason took hold.	Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.	Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.	But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...	You were possessed.  That is true -- possessed by your subconscious mind.  You were in the Houmfort, surrounded by their symbols.  To them, nothing worse can happen to a person than to be made into a Zombie.  Your subconscious mind used their own words for evil.
All that you say comes down to the same thing.  You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.	Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.	You admit that it is terribly dangerous. Why do you advise it?
I don't know -- I don't know--	It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...	Technical responsibility, real responsibility -- what difference does it make?  Jessica lives -- or she dies. That's what we're talking about!
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.	Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
An accident at the mill?	No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.	What about her?	In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.	Investigation of what?	Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.	In other words, I'm on trial.	I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.	Maybe it's better this way, Mother. I'm glad you're going home, Betsy -- you'll be out of the mess.
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.	Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it?  Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.	No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.	To the asylum?	I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.	It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.	Why?	Because he drove Jessica insane -- deliberately -- coldly!
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.	Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.	Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
We're all in it.  There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use.  Say something, Paul!  You've always been good with words.  Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders!	You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.	Are you going to lie for him, Mother?	Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there.
That isn't true.  You never understood her.	That night, I went to the Houmfort. I kept seeing Jessica's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart. The drums seemed to be beating in my head.  The chanting -- the lights --  everything blurred together.  And then I heard a voice, speaking in a sudden silence.  My voice.  I was possessed.  I said that the woman at Fort Holland was evil and that the Houngan must maker her a Zombie.
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?	Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?	Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?	Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.	Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?	Got a meeting uptown.	Right o'.	Up the organization!  Bastard.
Benjie!	Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?	Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!	Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?	Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?	Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.	Yeah, good.
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.	Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?	In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?	No thank you. We should be off.	Gotcha.
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --	And as usual no one believed me...
You're staring at me.	I wasn't star--	I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.	That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.	I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?	Why shouldn't she be?
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...	So maybe you'll come too?	Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.	It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.	"Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that ""I'm OK. You're OK"" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --"	-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --	Elena.
Good night.	Good night.
The Halfords have invited us again this year.	You want to go?	What do you think?	Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
I'm, uh, going to bed.	So early?	Rough day. Good night.
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?	Hmm. Good night.
You all right there?	Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?	Um, yes.
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.	I do. I'm -- are you...?	I... I think I am...	You know Elena, I've been thinking--	Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--
You crying?	I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...	Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --	No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --	You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?	I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.	Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you want to accuse me, you've got --  Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot.
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.	That shirt?	What?	Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
The turkey in?	Stuffed and baking.
Dinner in ten minutes.	You go dry off now.
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -	Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.	I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.	So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?	Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.	Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.	Yeah, that one.	That one.
What's for dessert?	See for yourself.	No advice from the experts, huh?
Don't start.	You think I --	I have no idea.	What's on your mind? Don't --	It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.	What do you mean?	Don't be dim.	Elena, what are you're talking about?	I'm not surprised.	Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --	Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.	Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?	It's a starting place.	Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?	If you're going to insult me --	What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.	Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.	Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?
You've...	In the car.	Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
This just isn't the best moment for this.	I know, I know. I had no idea --	That this was going to be a key party?	Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?	Well?	I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.	Damn it, Ben --	I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --	You're not going to --	I'm not.	You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --	Elena.
Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --	Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.	Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.	Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
Ready to go?	We're not going anywhere.
Elena.	Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?	I'll drive you --	Ben.
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?	Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?	We'll talk in the morning.
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --	The phone's out.	Yeah. Well, we can just --	Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --	Paul? Yeah. You think --
Hi dad.	Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?	I'm fine dad.	Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.	Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --	Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...
So how's school treating you?	All right.	Classes?	Good.	Grades?	Fine.	Anyone special? You know...	Hnnn.	Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?	Yeah.	You know Paul, I've been thinking, maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk, you know, about -- well --
About?	Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.	Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.	All the more reason for this little heart to heart... great.
Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.	Sure dad.	Thanks.
See you.	Stay out of trouble.
Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?	Libbets. Libbets Casey.	Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets?
It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --	Ben--	Yeah?	You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.	You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.	You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.	Gotcha.
Here.	After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?	In a bit.
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?	Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.	Yeah, but, I -- I've been working a lot lately, and -- No, that's not it. I guess we've just been on the verge of saying something, whatever it is, just saying something to each other. On the verge.
Huh?	Birth control.	Right. Gotcha.
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.	Damn right, but where the hell were you?	What are you talking about?	Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
A prior engagement overcame me.	What?	Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.	Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --	How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --	I just can't believe you could be so --
Dad stop it!	Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
Fascist!	If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
Good-night dad.	Good night kiddo.
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?	Nah.	What you been up to?	Nothing.
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --	Jesus all right enough!
What the hell are you kids doing down here?	What do you think we're doing, dad?	What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other. I think you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake, and I think he's trying to get into your slacks. I think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood --
Talking to me, dad?	Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!	Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.	I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.	Huh?	I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess...
Your toes cold?	Yeah.
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.	C'mon.
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.	And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --	-- Well what am I supposed to call you?	That's besides the point.
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --	Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?	You know, dah--
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --	Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --	Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --	-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --	But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --	-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --	-- What advice? You never --	That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --	-- 73	-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
But...	But what?	But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena.
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.	Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --	It was all junk!
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.	Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
What?	Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.	That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.	I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.	Thanks for the advice Dave.
Good shit.	Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --	It's what?	Don't fret, Benjie, it's --	Darn it, Dave.
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.	A key party?	You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.
Thank you Janey.	It was lovely!
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?	I suppose we'll make an appearance.	And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?	Let me.
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.	You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.	Somehow it was different in my imagination when I thought about it. Actually, I didn't think about it at all, really.
You want coffee or something?	Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --	Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?	My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --	What the hey. Let's go for a drive.	Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--	Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --	Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.	Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --	Well, we can talk about it.	That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.	Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?	Of course.
You okay?	Yeah. You?	Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.	Sure. Maybe coffee.	Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
Hi mom.	Hi Wendy.
I saw you on your bike today.	With Mikey?	Who?	Nobody.	Mikey Williams?	We were just riding around.
Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.	Mom. Are you ok?	Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.	You're not a psycho!	The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.	I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --	We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.	Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --	Oh Wendy.
They need the money for my band uniform at school.	I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.	I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.	Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.	Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?	I suppose. Why?	Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.	What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.	Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
I don't like coffee.	It'll warm you up.
Please don't.	It's not a bother.	I insist.  Don't touch them.
Oh.	It's really quite all right.	Of course.
Thanks again. For the dinner.	Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.	I used to know how to cook.	It's not like we're too busy.
I'm thinking of going back to school.	Social work?	How'd you know?	Educated guess.	I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --	You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
Here you are.	Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--	None at all. I'll leave it in front of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?	Yes.	Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.	Yes, it was -- I ended up --	No need to make excuses --
It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --	I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --	Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?	They say you never forget.	Forget what?	Forget how to ride a bike.
In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.	You're saying that Christ is the child, and --	-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.	All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?	You ask what the point is?	That's right.	Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?	I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.	If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --	I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.	You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.	But not too ashamed.	Now you are being rude.	And you're still trying to get me into bed.	Ouch.
I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?	I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.	That I will indeed.
Reverend Edwards.	Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.	Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.	I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
Arise and shine, young Hood.	I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.	The water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and Ben&Ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious Thai stick.
Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.	Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.	Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?	I gotta get to English class.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.	See ya.	Where you going?	Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.	Flame on, asshole.	And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
How can you do that man?	Do what?	Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.	Um, Libbets Casey.	What?	Aha! I could sense the vibe.	What do you mean?	Am I right or am I right?	Shit. You're not planning --	My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.	Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?	All will be revealed, baby.
Huh?	Moisture! Moisture!
And whence has yon virginal maiden absconded?	Like into one of the other 20 or so bathrooms they've got in this place.
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.	Pharmaceutical! You are a god.	One for you and one for me.
Awesome sleet and rain.	Major.	Howdy there. You, young knight. Can you check on the mead? Can you sally forth and secure us some more mead?
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.	Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
No candy for me?	Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.	Let's see!
Jesus, Jim!	Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.	Just be careful.	You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?	Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.	Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.	You going to tell dad?	Would it matter?  And what's that?	You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.	It's not packed with explosives, is it?	No!	Play with the whip.
Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?	The Idiot?	If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.	Great, thanks for the tip.	The Idiot.
Frankie opens them with his teeth.	Hey, it's a sellable skill.
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --	What is it?
Maybe you should have just a half.	Thanks for the advice dad.
Yeah.	You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --	Yeah but you don't even know me really.	Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.	My what?	It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --	And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.	You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --	And I have a feeling for you too, because you're just like -- I feel for you like you're -- you're just like --
I do.	Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?	Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted.
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.	Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.	It's beyond mere physical attraction.	That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.	Truly? Do speak.	My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!	How do you know this shit?	They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?	You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?	Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?	Good thinking Marge.
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?	Who said so?	No one.	I don't have a girlfriend.
Mikey?	Yeah?	Geometry?	Sure, anything but this English.
Why are you so good at math but not in English?	I'm not good at math. Just geometry.
Where you going?	Out.	It's freezing.	Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.
Want some gum?	Sure.  Twinkie?	I'm chewing.
Did you tell Sandy?	Tell Sandy? What?
I don't ever want to see you.	Then why'd you come after me?
You have to follow me?	I dunno. I --
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?	Maybe we can just watch some TV.	There's a TV in the basement.
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...	I don't know.	Why did you -- with Sandy?	I don't know.	You like him? He worships you.
Wow!	Wendy!
When worlds collide.	Huh?	4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.
You're parents at that party?	Yeah. Yours?	You get in trouble?	Maybe. Can't really tell yet.	I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.	Yeah.
Charles.	Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?	I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?	Watching what?	Nixon, doofus! It's incredible. He should be shot.
Hello, Charles.	Greetings, Charles.
How are the parental units functioning these days?	Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.	I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.	Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?	Why don't you use the phone downstairs?	Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.	Can I come?	It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.	With who?	Her name's Libbets.	Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
Hood residence.	Charles, what time is it?	Is this Charles?	What time is it?	Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?	I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --	And?	Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.	Right.	What are you doing at home on a Friday night?	I have plans.
Hey Wendy.	Hey Sandy.	Mikey was looking for you.	Yeah? See ya.
Well, you can...	Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.	All my model planes.	The ones you built?	They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.	I have to go to the bathroom.	Yeah.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.	What are you doing?	Just thought I'd stop by.	Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.	Yeah.	Are you his girlfriend?	No.
He's dead.	If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.	He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
Well.  It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.	Communist Viet Cong.	They left it in the jungle.
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?	Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
Want a drink?	Vodka?	You never tasted the stuff?
It feels warm.	One more shot?	Okay.
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?	Huh?	That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.
I love you.	That's nice. Are you drunk?	I don't know. How do I know?	I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
Yes, sir.	That's all, for now.
Didn't want to miss anything.	Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.	Good.	Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.	Sure.
Just after Leland Street.	What's that, then?
Nice kid.	Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
So far.	What's the D.A. got them on?	Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.	Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.	About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
Will, you can't blame yourself.	I had him!	It's only gonna make you crazy.
I have to get back.	Too bad...
My partner...	Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
You did your homework, Officer.	Actually...
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.	Don't worry about him...
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.	But they're so boring.  All small stuff.	It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?	Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.	We already did.	Do it again.	But there wasn't any...
Who's that?	The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.	Good.  He's up next.
This murder was in the papers, right?	Yeah.  All over.	Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  We can get it in by the morning editions.
I could say the same thing about you.	Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.	Who's playing?	The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
She your only sibling?	Twelve years younger.
Oh, I shouldn't have...	It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.	That must have been awful for you.
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.	Okay.
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.	Then change it.	How much closer would you say you were?	I don't remember.	Five feet?  Seven feet?
Duggar called him?	About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Not really.	Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
It's legitimate.	Worth pursuing?
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.	I know.	Byrd's dead.
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.	Why?
What about your shoulder?	Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
Sorry about...	Where is he?
Thanks.	I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.	He would have liked that.	We just gotta catch the bastard, right?	That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.	What I saw?	Anything.  It's important.
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.	Right.  Got lost in the rocks.	We'll get the other one, though.
No.	No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...	Like I said, no.  We know about those things up here.
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.	What time was that?	Around twelve-thirty.
Who was the last one to see her alive?	Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
We're sure it's hers?	Has her books in it.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...	No.
What are you doing here?	I told her to come.
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.	I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
I'll call him now.	First I need a copy of the key.
Forget your pager?	What?	I beeped you over two hours ago.
Good.	And something else that might interest you.
No.	One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
That's right.	Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.	So?	This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
Where you signed this?	That's right.	What happened at that signing?	She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.	Did she?	Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.	How do you mean?	That boyfriend.  Randy.
Randy Stetz?	That's right.
Are you sure about that?	She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.
Eight years.	Seven years.
They're all over everybody.	"I.A.'s calling themselves the ""Corruption Task Force.""  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or ""oversights"" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night."
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.	Even the best make mistakes.
What do you want to talk about?	You know what about.
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.	When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.	You know my plan of action.	To do nothing.	That's right.	Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...	He's asking everybody questions.	But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.	He's just rattling your cage.	Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.	We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that.
Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?	You know I remember that.	One word to I.A. and he walks.	Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...	No way.	Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...	Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And every bastard like him.  We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk.  Every last one.  And I am <i>not</i> going to let that happen.  No deals.  No compromises.  No discussions.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.	What are we thinking?
Looks like the natives are restless.	Will?
I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids...	Don't do this, Hap...
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.	Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...	You don't have to be involved, Will.	You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
Your friend's all business.	I'm always all business.
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.	Habit.
Fred Duggar?	No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.	I'm not expecting anyone.	That's not what he thinks.	What did he look like?
Will...I...	What is it?	There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep.
One of your cases?	Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
Will.	There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
What if someone finds out?	We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
Did you love her?	Huh?	Kay Connell.  Did you love her?
"""She was nice.""  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?"	Huh?	You heard me that time.	She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.	But she was seeing someone else on the side.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.	Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?	Stuff.	What kind of stuff?	Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.	The other guy?	I told you I don't remember.	After that she left the party to go to him.	How should I know?...	Ran like hell to go to him...	Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
I don't know.	You don't know.	She didn't tell me.
Thought I smelled something.	Good to see you, too, Randy.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.	You're not missing much.	What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
I was her best friend.	Best friend?	Since grade school.	That's a long time.	We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.	Must be tough for you.  What happened.
You want me to take you somewhere?	Long as it's fun.
Hey...	Thought you wanted something fun...
You and Kay were like sisters?	That's what I said.	Told each other everything.  That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?
No...	Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
I don't know.	You don't know.	She wouldn't tell me!	But you were such good <i>friends...</i>
It was like some big fucking secret!	What was?	She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!	Who?	My arm!	Who?	She used some stupid code name.	What was it?	Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
No game.	The phone call.  The knapsack.
I'm sorry?	I said you're going to get a phone call.	Oh?	Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.	Thought you might find that.	You're going to be brought in for questioning.
Down at the station?	Yes down at the station.
She was only seventeen.	But she was an attractive girl.	I suppose.	Did you have sex with her?
No.	But you wanted to.	I was a mentor to her.
You gave her gifts.	Yes.	Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.	Yes.	Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.	I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
What about him?	He.  Well, he...
Randy Stetz is in jail.	Told you I could write an ending.	Congratulations.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.	There's nothing more to talk about.	But we work so well together...
What the hell do you know?	Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
I told you that was an accident!	Then so was mine...	Don't you pull that shit with me.	I didn't want to kill her, Will.
Couldn't get it up, Walter?	It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
Yes.  Like that.	This an accident, Walter?	If you want it to be...
Where's your back-up?	No back-up.	You're not following procedure.	Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
Wild card.	Drop the gun, Walter.
Monstrous.	Yes, and very beautiful.	Your lips, they didn't move.	They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
Disappointing, isn't it? To come so far and find so little. Jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...	We had feared we were the only ones...	But how did you come into existence?
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.	Are you the leader of tis group?	If there were a leader, I would be the one.
So you have the answers...	Ah! You have questions?	What are we?	Nothing if not vampires...	Who made us what we are?	Surely you know the one who made you...	But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
That is a picture, nothing more.	You mean we are not children of Satan?	No.
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?	Then there is nothing.	Perhaps...
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...	Then God does not exist...	I have not spoken to him...	And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?	None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world.
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.	You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...	He knew nothing. He just didn't care.	Knew? You mean he is...
I was waiting for you...	Listen to me.
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.	Your lover.	No, my beloved, my child.	If you say so. You are innocent.	I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.	She is.	But why?	I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.	Then blame the one who made her...	Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.	We want no quarrel with him.	It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.	Then I leave too.
So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?	You said there were none.	But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.	We can do that?	You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.	That's what the one who made me said.	How he must have loved you.
And the vampires of the Theatre?	Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
Are these not the answers you came for?	Yes... My God...	A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --	Lestat! You knew Lestat!	Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
Where is she? Where's Claudia?	Follow me - that way - through my cell -
Not without Claudia. Where is she?	I can't save her.	You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.	Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
I couldn't prevent it.	I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.	Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.	You let them do it.
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.	Louis, I swear I did not.	I understand you only too well. You let them do it, as I let Lestat turn a child into a demon. As I let her rip Lestat's heart to pieces! Well I am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. Your melancholy spirit of this century! I know what I must do. And i warn you - you saved me tonight, so I return the favour - do not go near your cell in the Theatre Des Vampires again.
You didn't even warm them, did you?	No.	And yet you knew what I would o.	I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.	You were their leader. They trusted you.	You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
Your melancholy eyes...	What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?	We are a pair, and that's what counts.
More.	Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
I want some more.	It's bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that's it. My child. My beloved child.
I'm not your daughter.	Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
Why always on this night?	What night? What do you mean?	You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.	I didn't realise.	Is this my birthday?
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.	I have. Or there would be twice as many.	But you're the fairest by far.	You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?	What you are? You would be something other than you are?	And if I cut my hair again?	It will grow back again!	But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
You made us what we are, didn't you?	Stop her Louis!	DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!	Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!	Does it?	Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.	Is that supposed to frighten me?	You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.	I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.	Not you my dear.	You're a liar. But you upset my plans.	What plans?	I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
Stop pestering me then!	Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.	Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?	Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.	We forgive each other then?
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?	No. Laudanum.
Laudanum!	Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
Don't Louis --	Louis, put me in my coffin...	I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
I want more.	What have you done?
How did you learn to write, Claudia?	The way I learn everything. By watching you.
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.	Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.	Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.	He jests.	Why does he call you that?	Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
Claudia! You did that?	Sit still. It's not finished -
You want me to be a doll forever?	Claudia - don't -	Why not?
We're immortal. You've always known that.	Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.	And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
You... fed on me?	And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.	You both did it?	I took your life. He gave you another one.
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.	He'll never let us go.
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.	Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
He's dead, Claudia, dead.	The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?	Don't mock, Claudia...	The swamp...
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.	And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.	Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.	I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
Louis, look at me.	I can't. Go away from me.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.	And you never cried -	I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -	Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -
What was that?	The workmen must have a trunk - don't stop, cherie -
It can't be -	It is! Take the back stairwell -
The ship is sailing wihout us!	Not yet.
How do I look?	Still my beautiful child.
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?	Yes...
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?	Yes.	Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?
You don't remember? Or you never knew.	It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.	But how will I ever know, Louis?
Or her, or her - or any of them?	Claudia, you torture yourself.	They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.	You are more beautiful than any of them.
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.	You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
You know her?	Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?	Come, Claudia...
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.	Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.	They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.	How devilishly clever.
She's no vampire.	No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
This is no performance.	And no one knows but us...
This is monstrous!	Yes, and very beautiful.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!	Be still!
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!	What danger?	I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
Do you think I would let them harm you?	No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.	Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.	Love?
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.	Never.	He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.	That's not so.	Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...	So you felt it too!	Let him go, he said. Let him go.
He can protect us, Claudia.	You really believe that?
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?	Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!	Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!	Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...	Yes...	And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.	But if she dies...	It's only mortal death.
Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.	What do you mean?	What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
They would have killed you -	Then my luck would have changed.	You want death? Is it death you want?	Yes...
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?	And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
You're not afraid of anything, are you?	Why should I be?
What do you want from me?	I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
Diane!!!!	They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...	NO!!!!!
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?	Give it to me!!!	Vampires. We thrive on blood.	I want it!
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.	How do you mean, start?	Call him.
Let's call that a start.	I can't do it.	You've just done it -	Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.	You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.	I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?	I can't go through with it, I tell you.	Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.	But why do you want me?	Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.
You really want to be with them?	Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -	You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
Did I hear a yes?	Yes...
You're sure?	Sure...
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.	Dying?
Come, you're going to feed now.	I want a woman.
Take him.	The crucifix -	Forget the crucifix. Take him.
What have I done?	You have fed. You were made for this...
Dear God, what have I done?	You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.	It can't be...	Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.	And if I don't?	The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.	Do you think so?
I know. It gets cold so fast.	We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...	Fascination...	Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle --
But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.	Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
Have you ever been caught?	Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.	But how do you know?	Read her thoughts.	I can't.	The dark gift is different for each of us. But one thing is true of everyone. We grow stronger as we go along.
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.	I don't know any hell -
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.	Paris? You came from Paris?	As did the one who made me.	Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!	I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?	But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.	Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!	I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.	Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
You fool, what have you done?	What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
Where are we?	Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
We belong in hell.	And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?	I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.	What do you imagine you are Louis?	I don't pretend to know.	Don't you understand, Louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of God.
Lestat, she's alive!!!!	Vampires are killers. Predators, who's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
The girl, Lestat -	I know. Let her alone.
Why do you do this Lestat?	I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
Lestat - finish this -	You finish her - if you feel so much -
Unless I make her one of us...	NO!!!	THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...	In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.	No...
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.	Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.	That and more.
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.	Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?	Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
She's here, your wounded one.	What are you saying?	You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
Lestat!	You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -	I didn't want to kill her.	Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.	Lestat, what do you mean?
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!	That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.	You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!	Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...	She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!	Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
No... You come back to me Louis...	Are you mad????
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.	CLAUDIA!!!
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...	Don't try to speak... it's alright...	I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...	That's all past, Lestat.	Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.	Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.	You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
It's only a siren...	I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!	And they frighten you?	You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.	It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...	If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.
I have to go now Lestat...	You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...	Yes. I remember...
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.	I tried...	And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.	You have it...
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...	That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -	You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.	So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.	You followed me here, didn't you?	Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?	It's just a room...	So shall we begin?  What do yo do?	I'm a vampire.
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?	Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.	Well, what a lucky break for me.	Perhaps lucky for both of us.
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?	Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...	We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.	But I thought vampires didn't like the light.	We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
How did you do that?	The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?	You're not lying to me, are you?	Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.	Yes.	But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...
You said the slave had a crucifix...	Oh, that rumour about crosses?	You can't look at them...	Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.	The story about stakes through the heart?	The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.	What about coffins?	Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
You loved Yvette...	Can a vampire feel love?	You loved your wife, surely.	I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
Shall we go on?	He did it to make you stay with him!	Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine...
But why did you tell her?	How could I not? She had to know.	And did you lose her? Did she go?	Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
Did he die in the fire?	He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
You found nothing?	Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.	No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?	Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
Lestat escaped the fire!	He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
No... it can't end like that...	But it has. There is no more to tell.	But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?	It's over, I'm telling you...	You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?	If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?	No...	Don't say anymore. The reels are still turning. I have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I've said.
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!	Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
You promise to care for her then?	Yes...	And you know what you ask for?
Yes.	What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?	A child who can't die...
And the child who did die?	My daughter...
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?	Yes!
What can I do for you?	Checking in...Karla Wilson.
You're in 201 and 202.	Is that bad?	Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites.
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.	And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.	Wait...Did you say off-season?	July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.	What about a radio?	Sorry. Emergencies only.	What the hell would you call this?	I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.	Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
Your what?	Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?	We haven't exchanged anything.
Storm season?	It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
Listen to me. He's here.	Who? Who is here?
I want off this island.	Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry left hours ago. And we got a storm coming. There won't be another one for days.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.	Phones went down a few minutes ago.
You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?	Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
Stupid. Stupid.	Stupid. What were you thinkng?
Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.	I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.	No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be psyched.
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --	No.	The guy looks dead.
Get lost, you scared me.	Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.	Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.	That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.	Storm is what makes it interesting. Thass why all the fish are up. Less hook us a couple big ones.
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.	Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
I thought you were out of town!	What are you doing in my closet?
I thought you were out of town!	What are you doing in my closet?	i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
That was heart attack time, Karla.	No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.	Yeah, right -- whatever.	I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.	Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
There's nothing between Will and me.	Yet. Nothing yet.
Say yes.	No.	No means yes.	Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?	Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.
That could break the machine.	Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
The number's unlisted...	Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt.	Okay, okay. You're right.	I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?	Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
He's not coming. I thought he was just...	Julie, you left four messages... Four.	But, he said he'd try.	He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!	He does work hard.	Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...	Then, don't.
Oh!	Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
I'm the King of the World.	No, I'm the King of the World.
Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.	I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
Hello? Hello?	Where is everyone? I'll ask --
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.	Karla! You promised.	I also promised Tyrell.
Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute --	He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...	I miss Ray...I tried to call him.
Karaoke -- perfect.	Don't even think about it.	Okay, I won't.
No way.	Yes.	No.	Yes.	Not me...no way...
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?	The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
You get any sleep at all?	Some.
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.	Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
Nice move.	I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
Cancer in a box.	No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
Karla!	Just kidding.
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.	I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.	They never found the body.
Julie...	Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
Let him go. I believe him.	Come on, Julie. You saw his room.
What do you mean?	Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
I know I don't want to stay in here.	We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
Be careful, Julie.	I've got to see.
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.	Then, we fight --
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.	Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.	It's too late for that.
There's no way to lock it.	What do we do?
I don't know...	Come on, you can make it.
Julie?	I'm right here. Grab my hand.
I'm holding your hand!	No, you're not.	...Nancy?
Oh, god, it's you --	You're okay. Thank god.	Is he?
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?	Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.	Yeah.	Ray, we're just friend.	Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.	Why are you being like this?
Ray, I can't...	Can't what?	I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
I understand something.	It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.	No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --	No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...	It's okay.
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.	What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...	This weekend?
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.	Will you try...for me, please?
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.	Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
Ray...what are you doing?	Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?	Never do that again.	Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
I love it here.	It's gonna be great.
Checking the locks again?	You know me to well.
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.	Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.	That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise.  Wanna dance?
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.	Fine. Show me the body.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.	Who?	Ben Willis.
Voodoo.	I told you.
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?	I don't know.	You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this --
Don't kill me --	Wait, it's Nancy --
Julie! Wait! You okay?	I'm fine.	You sure?	I'm fine.	You don't seem fine.
The shower again?	It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.	I'm sorry.	I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.	It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.	It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
It was one year ago...	It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.	I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.	To get out of Southport?	Right. Now I remember.
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?	I'm okay.	Are you sure?
This was not my idea.	What?	I said, this...Do you want a drink?
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.	What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.	Deep breaths --	Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.	You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.	Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.	It beets being on the mainland.
You sure it's okay with you?	Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.	You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
Julie? What's wrong?	It's...him.	What do you mean, Julie?	He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.	It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...
No, no, no. This was really sweet...	I scared you -- I crossed the line --	No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.	Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.	Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
What? What are you talking about? Where?	It's in my room!
There was a body! I swear it!	Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.	I wasn't dreaming.
Come on. We're gonna be okay.	Did you get help?
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.	He's in it with Willis?	I guess so.
Why are you doing this to me?	Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.	I trusted you.	We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
...Why?	Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.	I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.	Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.	I'll talk real slow.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.	Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Is there a problem here?	Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.	Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.	We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
Oooh, the mainland --	Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Guess the capital of Brazil --	Rio, baby!
Pretty cool bar.	They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.	Why?	'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?	Hello?	Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.	Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.	I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.	Hey --	See any dead bodies out there? Any fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason?
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.	We gotta get out of here. Now.
I'll come with you.	Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?	I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
You think that's a good place to hide?	I don't know, but I'm starving.
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...	I said we start having fun. And that means now.
To a great weekend --	Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
Come on, it'll be fun.	Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
Ahh, that feels great.	How's Julie?	Alone. In the room.  Got any advise?
Why? He can't help us.	He's probably the only one who can help us.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.	Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?	Well, I'm in school and --	How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?	Yes!
Still here...thinking...  You mean Brazil, the country?	Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
Rio de Janeiro!	Oh, no...Did you say Rio?	No. Yes?
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!	We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
Jeez, that's a full carat --	How much?	Well, there's some flaws in her...	How much?
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.	Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.	I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
You guys lost?	Tell me this ain't the bar scene.	Wanna drink?
What's the matter, boy trouble?	Not anymore.	He leave you?	No. I shot him.
What's going on?	Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.	Cool.	The rest of us see bathrobes.
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --	And so could you -- crazy fool.	You stumbled into my hiding place.	Must have missed the sign.	Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I've never seen a dead body before.
Can't talk right now.	See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.	Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.	So why are you still here?
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.	How's the water?	Crowded.
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.	You don't have to be a jerk.
Where is everybody?	They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.	You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --	Hey -- shut up, okay?
Take this.	And do what with it?
They were cut loose.	Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --	Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
We'll only be a second, okay?	Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
Where'd Estes go?	What is up with that weirdo?	I'll go find him.
You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece - the dancing, the singing and the white marble --	How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?	This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.	How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.	The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
Where is Miss Wollsten?	She's in her room.
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.	This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.	It is my home.  My name is Hugo Albrecht.
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.	You collect these to sell, abroad?
He is exhausted.	Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
I need your advice  something has happened  Mr.  Jacks 	Drunk again?	He's dead. I want the General to see him.
"He complained of not feeling well. I thought he was drunk 	he staggered."	That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently  walked blindly.
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.	Or even spirit messages from the next world.
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.	In case you do so, would you --
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..	Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.	I'll go up and take a look at the General - perhaps sit with him.	He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.	All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.	Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.	Well 	Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.	Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
Goodbye.	May life be good to you both. As for the others  they will be quiet here  and I will be with them.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.	Good winds and bad winds!
The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --	They used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages. Some still do --
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.	I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
You're just talking nonsense.	Let us put it to the test. Protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of. I'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to Hermes -- not that I believe in him any more than I do in Science.
We will see who is the first to die.	Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.	I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
) You feel the symptoms?	My friend -- what can one say --	You can have your servants prepare a dinner. That is the way I'll meet my old- familiar enemy -- Death --I have fought him before. I've won often. Now he wins. Let him come for me at my own banquet.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.	I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?	This was once a cemetery.
The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?	They were gore before I came here.	But why?
There was some trouble here the villagers on the mainland -this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.	All the graves?	I'm afraid so. There were rumors people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.	I donut understand.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.	I'll get Ida to make up your bed.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.	We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.	In the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others.  Let them think it was a normal  And, perhaps it was - perhaps it was.
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.	That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.	Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.	No.  She shall not be left here.	Maybe you're right. Help me get something to carry her downstairs.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.	That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.	M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.	Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..	How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..	Thank you.
Good night, Oliver.	Sleep well.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?	I think not.
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --	No one can take my father's place.
Where's Thea?	I think she went to bed  I saw her going toward the house
Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!	On my word! That's what they believe.
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --	Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --	Closer and closer - until they bite into your throat!
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!	Poor Cathy --	Last night Dr. Drossos -- today you or I -- oh, no, Oliver, it can't be you, I couldn't stand it.
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.	If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?	I don't know now without my father.
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.	I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?	Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?	She has never mentioned her family.	How old is she?
What are you doing?	I was looking for you.
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill  or frightened.	How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?	No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.	In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.	Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.	They shall not hurt you
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer  a correspondent of some sort 	And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
You are fortunate in your father.	Thea is an orphan.
Cathy - how does it feel to have a father?	What an odd question!	I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?	Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --	I do not know him, but I have seen him.	What is it -- what are you talking about?	You have forgotten my last name?
I have forgotten it, dear.	My last name is Pherides.
Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.	But one must love a father.	The General  you don't even know him.
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.	I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now - I don't know 
I felt he did not like me.	That should decide it or you --	I will let him go. He is dead to me as he is to all my mother's people. I turn my hand against him.
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.	When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.	She is dead  at peace.
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?	It was, the plague	We quarreled. She never dared get angry or frightened -- but I said things to her -- it was an attack, I know it was.
I wish I didn't have such bitter knowledge of you, Cathy.	Whet do you mean?	They were talking about the Vrykolakas this morning. Cathy, that's what you are  a weak, pale, half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live.	Miss Wollsten!	You and your mysterious illness. A new attack everytime you are crossed  everytime you can't get your own way.
Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.	How do you know what my father thought - -	Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life you've ruined mine 	You were father's secretary - I never thought - -	Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
What would I be thinking?	Mr. Davis seems a good prospect young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -	What if he is?	) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints  the way you can turn the truth into a lie --	Why, I'm fond of Thea.	You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you - I'll warn them against you.	You will not say one single word. I know your secret.	That your father and I 	"No. I mean your other secret -	the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me."
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours  but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.	Would you care to explain what you're talking about?	You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man   working at him   turning him against Thea.	Really, this is idiotic!	You'd do anything to get Oliver away from Thea. But I'm going to stop you. I'm going to tell Mr. Davis exactly what you are.
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people - a cataleptic!	You wouldn't tell that 	Wouldn't I?
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.	This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.	"I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.	He can't tell "
Woman, what are you doing here?	I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed  imprisoned..	He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.	Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.	He's dead enough. God rest his soul.
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.	Yes?	I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep - I want to avoid it.	I don't understand you.	I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure - quite sure.	If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.	No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.	You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?	That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.	Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The ViceConsul at Adrianople brought her to me..	Her name is Thea?	Theodosia.	Her family name?	Damn me, if I know. She's become so much a member of our household I never think of her by any name but Thea -- she has a last name --
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?	Miss Wollsten - my secretary, she'd know.
Your daughter is ill.	She's not too well.	What is her illness?	Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --	Was she ill before that girl came into your household?	Why -- no not before Thea came 
This girl --	This girl -- Thea - is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.	I will go with you.
Why not Take the doctor's advice? You're the hero of the battle of Corphon.	Hero?	In the New York Morning Globe, the man who wins victory is always a hero. -
You know that sound, Oliver?	I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?	You were at those battles as a spectator   I wonder if you can think what that sound might mean to me  those men out there  dead or dying  by my order -- because I willed it so.
Do you mind if I go with you?	There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.	I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
She is not there. The coffin is gone.	Maybe you've got the wrong crypt  after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in - the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me  a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.	It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.	I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl 	Thea?
There is something evil about her.	Oh, now  now look here 	I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.	But that should make you like her.
It makes me fear her.	I can't understand that.	It is not necessary to understand. We are leaving and I am thankful.
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.	We have no time for that.
I've seen men die drunk - and I've seen men die of the plague.	Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?	The rider on the pale horse is Pestilence. He follows the wars.
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.	But the war, the army  they need you.	Better no general than one carrying the plague.	We still don't know that it's the plague 	Dr. Drossos will tell us. We will know what to do then.
Thea is so like her  in every feature 	If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.	How did she die?	I don' t know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back pale -- sick -- she died --
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?	In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.	I had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why?	You are my friend.	And I'm your friend  but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?	If I told you  you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you  the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -	That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle -	Listen to what I say --	When you make sense I'll listen.
I have had command for the last time -	Come - you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.	I shall not leave the island 
Theodosia --	Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
Daughter -- my daughter --	She was born before your wife returned here to die. You never knew.
You're crying. Why?	I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --	Everything's so simple. I like you.
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?	Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.	Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won't harm you.
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --	You see? Thea believes it, too!
Thea, what's wrong?	The General threatened me.	Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble  the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.	He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.	Well, tell, him.	I can't.	Why in the world can't you?	He hates all my race.	I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.	It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
"Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? ""He stole your mother"" -"	It is for that he hates me.
I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.	Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.	For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -	No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it - he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.	Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.	All I'm asking is thirty days more . . .
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.	Then foreclose!	I can't do that. These families have children.
But they're somebody's children.	Are you running a business or a charity ward?	Well, all right . . .
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family  no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.	So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.	How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?	Sure I have, but I got rid of it.
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.	Who?	The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.
Get that ladder up here.	All right  all right.	Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.	I'm hurrying.
George . . .	Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.	Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
Stand back.	Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me.	I hate to do this, fella.
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?	Don't . . . George?
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?	What did . . .
Good morning, sir.	Carter  bank examiner.	Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.	Merry Christmas.	We're all excited around here.  My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.	Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.	Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.	Yeah, very funny.	Well . . .  . . . now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
You what? To save me?	Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?	Go through with what?	Suicide.
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.	What are you, a mind reader or something?	Oh, no.	Well, who are you, then?	Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.	Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?	Angel, Second Class.
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.	I wouldn't be a bit surprised.	Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
I told you  I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.	Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?	I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.	I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.	Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
By letting me help you.	Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?	Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.	Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.	Oh, tut, tut, tut.	I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.	Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .
What'd you say?	I said I wish I'd never been born.	Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You . . .  . . . wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea.  What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right.  You've got your wish. You've never been born.
What did you say?	You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.	Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .	Our clothes are dry.
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.	You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
You have no car.	Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!	It isn't me!	Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.	You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.	Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow  you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?	No.	You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
No.	No wonder you jumped in the river.	I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.	Made what?	Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.	Why? Don't they believe in angels?
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .	What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?	No, of course not.	Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?	Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.	Then if I wasn't born, who am I?	You're nobody. You have no identity.
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.	There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . .
What?	Zuzu's petals.
You know where he lives?	Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?	Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
Clarence . . .	Yes, George?	Where's Mary?	Oh, well, I can't . . .	I don't know how you know these things, but tell me  where is she?
I . . .	If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.	I'm not supposed to tell.
She's . . .	Where is she?
Poor George . . . Sit down.	Sit down? What are . . .	If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?	Well, naturally. Of course.	Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
Where? I don't see a thing.	Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
Why, yes. This is amazing.	If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.	Oh, wonderful!
Hey, who's that?	That's your problem, George Bailey.	A boy?	That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
What did you stop it for?	I want you to take a good look at that face.	Who is it?	George Bailey.	Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.	That's the kid.	It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?	Not a soul.	Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?	Well, wait and see.
I know. I know. He didn't go.	That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star  made second team All American.	Yes, but what happened to George?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.	No!
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.	Yes, but George . . .
You sent for me, sir?	Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.	Splendid! Is he sick?	No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.	Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?	You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.	Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.	What's that book you've got there?	The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.	Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.	Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?	The Building and what?	The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.	They went out of business years ago.
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!	I know. I know.	I know that girl!
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.	Thanks.	Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting  to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.
Thank you very much.	It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
What's that?	That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.	Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .	You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
Hey, Ernie!	Hiya, George!	Hi, Bert.
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.	Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.	Oh, look at this. Champagne!
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.	Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .	Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.	All right.
Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.	Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
Is this the place?	Of course it's the place.	Well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
Hello, Joseph, trouble?	Looks like we'll have to send someone down  a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.	George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?	That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.	Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.	Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.	Yes, but he's got the faith of a child  simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.	Joseph, now show him what happened today.	Yes, sir.
Well?	Mother . . .	Mother? What do you want?
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.	Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
Well, sure I do.	When'd you see him last?	Today, over at the house.	That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Hi, Daddy.	Well, what happened to you?	I won a flower.
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?	Want to give my flower a drink.	All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink.
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.	Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
There it is, good as new.	Give the flower a drink.
What?	Will you try to get some sleep?	I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.	I know  I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.	It will?	Uh-huh.
Daddy!	Zuzu  Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?	Fine.
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?	Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.	Old college graduate now, huh?	Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.	Yep.
Hee-haw!	Hee-haw!
We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're going to drive on down to Florida.	Oh . . .
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.	Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.	Oh, now, don't rub it in.	I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.	Goodbye, Sam.
Big  see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.	I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?	No charge.	That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge.
What boat you sailing on?	I'm working across on a cattle boat.	A cattle boat?
What's that?	I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
Goodbye, everybody!	All in . . .
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.	Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.	The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
Oh, no, Please, don't go out this way, Mr. Bailey.	I'm all right.
Oh, no  you don't feel so good.	I'm all right.	Please don't go away  please!
She's swell.	Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.	Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.	Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?	Uh-huh.	Came back three days ago.	Hmmmm . . .	Nice girl, Mary.	Hmmmm . . .	Kind that will help you find the answers, George.	Hmmm . . .	Oh, stop that grunting.	Hmmm . . .	Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?	Sure  Sam Wainwright.	Hmmm?	Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.	Well, she's not crazy about him.	Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?	No.	Well then, how do you know?	Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.	Oh . . .	And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.	And all's fair in love and war?
Mother, you know, I can see right through you  right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?	Uh-huh.
Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.	Oh, George!	Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction . . . This direction?  Good night, Mrs. Bailey.
George! George!	Yes, sir.	You're not paid to be a canary.	No, sir.
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?	No.	Anything I can do back here?	No.
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?	Ummmm . . .
Is it a charge, sir?	Yes  charge.	Mr. Gower, I think . . .	Aw, get going!	Yes, sir.
No . . . No . . . No. . .	Don't hurt my ear again!
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.	Oh, George.
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.	Aw, forget it.	Oh, it's wonderful.	Hope you enjoy it.
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?	No. No.
Yes, you bet.	Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
You want a martini?	No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Okay  all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?	Okay.  What's yours?
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!	Look, Nick. What's wrong?
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?	What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.	I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.	Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.	Oh . . .	I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.	I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?	Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess.
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?	Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.	We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.	He's pretty young for that job.	Well, no younger than I was.	Maybe you were born older, George.	How's that?	I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.	Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about  build things . . . design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff I was talking about.	Still after that first million before you're thirty.	No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
I know it's soon to talk about it.	Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.	You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?	This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.	Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.	Have a good time, son.
Got a match?	Very funny. Very funny.
What do you mean, and be bored to death?	Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.	I hope it works.
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.	Come on, George, let's hurry.	Did you get a doctor?
Oh, am I glad to see you.	Say, where's Mother?	She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.	Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.
Hello, George, how are you?	Harry . . . Harry . . .
George.	Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.	Do me a favor, will you, George?	What's that?	Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?	Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.	Aw, come on. Be a sport. Just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
Two cents worth of shoelaces?	She was here first.
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.	Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
Hey, George . . .	Hello, Violet.	Hello, what am I bid?
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.	Hello, Vi.
What gives?	Nothing.	Where are you going?	Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.	Huh?	Then we can go up to the falls. It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it. Then we can climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and . . . we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a terrific scandal . . .
George, can I see you for a second?	Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
No, George, don't . . .	Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?	I know, but . . .	What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
Say hello to New York for me.	Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.	Now, let's hear from you . . .
Violet Bick!	I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?	Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.	Some other time, George.	It's important.	There's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm.
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .	No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.	Peanut?
Hello.	How do you do.
Well, what do you know  wife.	Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look  if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?	Right down here.
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .	Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.	That way, huh?
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?	George . . .
Why didn't you call me?	I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.	All right now, what happened? How did it start?	How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.	When?	About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.	All of it?	Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.	Holy mackerel!	And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .	The whole town's gone crazy.
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.	Hello?
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.	Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
Those Rockefellers!	Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.	We'll save them for seed. A toast!
Now look, did you buy anything?	Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.	All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.	This way.
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?	Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
Pop!	Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
Pop!	They're not my children.
Yes, sir.	You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
Just a minute  just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!	I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.	I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know.  Well, I've said too much. I . . . You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.	You like it? I'll send you a box.
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.	The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?	Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.	Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.	Well, what about the Building and Loan?	Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?	Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?	Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.	I'd like to do that.	In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.	All right, sir.
Yes, sir.	Have you notified the police?	No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.	What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?	I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.	Well, what about all your other friends?	They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.	I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?	Five hundred dollars.
I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?	Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.	Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?	Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?	Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.	That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?	Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.	Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .
Made up your mind yet?	I'll take chocolate.
With coconuts?	I don't like coconuts.	You don't like coconuts! Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here  from Tahiti  Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!
A new magazine! I never saw it before.	Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
Well, hello.	Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.	Well, I don't.	You've passed me on the street almost every day.	Me?	Uh-huh.	Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
I'm not very good at this.	Neither am I.	Okay  what can we lose?
Hot dog! Just like an organ.	Beautiful.
Do I look as funny as you do?	I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.	Well, why don't you say it?	I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?	Eighteen.	Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.	Too young or too old?	Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.	You may kiss my hand.	Ummmmm . . .
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.	Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.	In that place?	Uh-huh.	I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
What'd you wish, George?	Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
Oh, no.	Come on, tell me.	If I told you it might not come true.	What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
I'll take it. And then what?	Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
Ouch!	Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.	I'm going to scream!
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.	Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?	How's that?	Have you made up your mind?	About what?	About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?	Didn't you tell her?	I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?	Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
When did you get back?	Tuesday.	Where'd you get that dress?	Do you like it?	It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.	Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.	Would you rather leave?	No, I don't want to be rude.	Well, then, sit down.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.	Thank you.
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.	Don't you like her?	Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.	Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?	No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you.
George . . . George . . . George . . .	Mary . . .
Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.	I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!	You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels  the oldest champagne  the richest caviar  the hottest music, and the prettiest wife!
After that, who cares?	That does it  come here.
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .	Please, let's not stop, George.	I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
Oh, Mary . . .	Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.	Darling, you're wonderful.
Have fun.	Thanks for dropping around.
Hi.	Hi.	Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?	To keep from being an old maid.	You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.	I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.	You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?	My baby.
George Bailey lassos stork.	Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?
Is it snowing?	Yeah, just started.	Where's your coat and hat?	Left them at the office.
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?	Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.	What is it, a sore throat or what?	Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.	The doctor? Was the doctor here?	Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.	Is she running a temperature? What is it?	Just a teensie one  ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
Where're you going?	Going up to see Zuzu.
Mary! Mary!	George, darling! Where have you been?
Oh, George, George, George.	Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!	Oh, George, George!	You have no idea what's happened to me.	You have no idea what happened . . .
Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner.	I've eaten.	Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.	I don't care. It's George's tux.
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.	What plates?	Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.	Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.	Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
I guess you forgot something.	Huh?	You forgot something.	What?	Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?	Sure, sure I am.	Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.	Oh, shucks . . .
How about that one there?	Hmm? Well, I . . .
How fast does this go?	With the right wind, 15-20 knots.	What?
You can?	You going to the lighthouse?
Come on, you guys.	Well, I don't know....
For me...?	What the hell.  For you....
Great!  Find one for me.	With butter, if they got any....
Wheee!  Faster!	How fast is enough?	I want to go faster!
My hair's getting wet!	So's mine.
When do we get to the lighthouse?	Soon, dark eyes, soon.
I can't wait to get there.	But of course.
Sure you do -- you win either way.	I'm supposed to.
Oh, shit.	Someone pop your balloon?	No problem, no problem.
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.	What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?	I can't help it  it sticks in my mind.
It's okay, it's okay....	Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.	I think we're changing course a little.
Don't!	Stop paddling!
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!	Back down!
Get on the rocks!	Swim for it!
Yeah, it's her job.	Is she responsible for the punch?	No.	Good.  It's terrible.
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.	I hope that's the cousin.
Maybe by now they are.	They're moving pretty fast.
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?	Yeah.	Then why are we futzing around the dock?  We can make a few bucks working at the beach.
Why not?	I could give you a dozen good reasons.	Shut up.	Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you.
Turkeys!  Eat wind!	Yee-hah!
Your dad must be really pissed.	We better go back in.	It's not going to be easy.
Putz -- that won't be for hours.	I was counting on hours.
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.	That's awful.	What the hell.  Did your mom put all this together?
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.	Shells and lobsters and stuff?	Mostly old garbage.  Today we found a '48 Hudson.
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.	Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
The lighthouse?	No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
Why'd they decide to move?	Too hot in the lighthouse?
What is it?	We're hung up on something.
Where're we going?	Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?	Listen to Andy, Sean.	We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!	Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
But the island!	The Shark.
We're carrying weight.	We'll take your supercargo.
Coming up!  Give way!	Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
Loser sails home alone.	You're betting what you already got.
As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in.  My dad's the mayor....	There's a shark....
Throw it.	Sean!  Catch it!
I don't know.	What the hell, we're steering for it.
Coming up!	Gangway, Turkies!
I thought you said she was going with us?	Let's just go sailing, okay?	Want to talk about it?	Want to swim home?
You coming up on him?	You bet.  Hang on....
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?	Anyone got another set of sails?
Hey!	Over here!
Sean!   Catch the rope!	The rope!  The rope!
We're hung up here.  Snagged.	Can you get us a line?
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?	Oh, yeah.  Sure.
Tina!	N-o-o-o-o-o-o....	It's okay, it's okay.  What's the matter?  Tina?  Honey?  Hey ---	No!  It's still there!	What is it?  What's there?	It's still there!	I need a hand here....
Good morning!	Aren't you off-duty?	Till noon.  This is on my own time.  Hi, Shorty.
On your own time?	Happy to do it.	Then check it out.  I'll be in the office.
Chief....	Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
I never heard of a 908.	"I just made it up.  It means, ""Get me out of there.""  What the hell's that?"	Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.	Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.	Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.	If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.	If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
We got a helluva tide this month.	Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
Chief?	In here.	I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.	You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.	Positive I.D.?	The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.	Oh.
What about that camera?	What camera?	That one -- from the wreck.  You brought it up, did you look inside it?
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....	If there is, develop it!	You got it.
I know just where to go.	Not the drugstore!	Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.	The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?	Nine-thirty, ten maybe.	Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.	Right.
How long ago?	About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
I can't let you take her out.	You can't stop me.
Mike's out there.	But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
Untie that rope.	Please.  It's my job.
You're too close.  Back off.	Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
I'm going out there.	Hey -- you can't do that.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....	Never mind that shit.  Just point.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.	Got it.
Where to?	No place special.  Just hanging out.	Sailing?
I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.	Every day?	What else is there to do?	You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.	Do I have to?	You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
I'm going.	What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?	Bartending?  I'm 17.	Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?	Because.	Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.	I'll be careful.  I'll see y'later.
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.	Okay, okay.
You stay here a minute.	Oh, c'mon.	You heard me.
Pop....	You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
Is Hooper coming to dinner?	Not till next year.
Michael.	Yeah?	You want to come here a minute?
I got something for you to do tomorrow.	I kind of had plans....	Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.	Hey, come on....	No backtalk!  I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there.  You can work until school starts.
Mike?  Is that you?	Pop.  I'm sorry.	It's okay.  What happened?
I passed out, but I'm okay.	At least you're safe.  What about the others?
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?	Sean's still out there.	What?
Dad, I'm sorry....	Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....	You said something about a camera.	Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....	Did you get any pictures?	Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny thing.  You can't tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow 'em up.  Here's a test I did....
Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....	What else you got?	Let's see -- you got a minute?	Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.	Okay, okay -- stand over there....
Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.	Me neither.	Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.	All of us thank you, okay?
May I have this dance?	Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
Wait a minute....	Too late, it's written.	Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?	Temporarily?  Uh...sure....
It came up during the meeting.	Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.	Is that what it is?	You're damn right that's what it is.
What have you seen before?  This is nothing.  Seaweed.  Mud.  Some- thing in the lens.	My ass!
There is nothing to discuss.	Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.	Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.	You don't make enough.	Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.	What's that supposed to mean?	It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again.  Ever!
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.	After we've looked, we'll talk.
Look at that:	First things first.
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.	Come on, let's check the bite radius.	The what?	Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?	The whale's mouth?	The Shark's mouth.	What shark?
The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?	We don't know that, do we?	But that's what we're here to find out, right?	You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.	Look, I know a little bit about sharks.	Do you?	I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
Carcharadon Carcharias.	That's it.	Okay, so that's it.	Is there one in these waters?	What makes you think there might be?	Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....	This is a mammal, not a fish.	Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.	Probably.	That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....	And sound.	Sound?	Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.	So there's one around here.	Not necessarily.  These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more.  None of them are immediately fatal.  Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
It's either a Great White, or another killer whale.	Can't you tell?	Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.	Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....	Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally.
Where the hell were you?	Late.	I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
Do I have to talk to those two?	My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?	Why?	Because they're playing our song.
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?	And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.	I did, I did.
Listen -- what are you doing later?	Fooling around?	Right.
Let's get the kid home.	Home it is.
Mmmm.	MMMmmmorning....
Sean's awake.	Door's locked.	Good.
Mrs. Silvera?	Mrs. Silvera.
Need a ride?	As far as the office.
Hey!  That's my boss!	Better yet.
You have to smoke so early in the morning?	It's good with coffee.	So's a donut.
Eat Cheerios.	What're you guys doing today?
Where's my day book?	In the den.
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?	Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.	One what?  Ah-ha!	Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?	It's an island.  Got to run.
Thank you.  I'll tell him.	For me?	Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.	Damn.
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?	Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?	Santos' place.
Oww!	Careful.  What's wrong?	Nothing.	Nothing, huh?	That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?	Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?	Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.	Oh.  Want to talk about it?	No.	Terrific.
All summer?	He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
I know what you're going to say.	Do you?	In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?	It was bad, wasn't it.	The goddamn smell is always the same.	Are you going to be able to sleep?	Yeah.   I think so.  Mike!  Keep it down, for chrissake!
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.	That's great.	Sean's asleep.	That's great too.  Gorgeous.
What's wrong?	Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.
What?	What'd I say?	That you were fired.	Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.	Because of today?  The beach?	No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.	Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!	Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....	Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....	...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....	They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....	Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....	I know you did....	I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
What're you going to do today?	Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.	I'll give notice.	Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.	Just one minute....
What're you doing?	Going out.
What is it?  What's the matter?	Mike's out there.
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.	Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.	Thank you, thank you.  You know my son, don't you?
I'm showing summer rentals.  We got a helluva season going.	We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.	We're alone.	Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
Are you serious?	Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....	No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.	I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?	Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.	We have to do something.	We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.	I know, I know....	And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.	It's still a good idea.	Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.	Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....	A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.	Two of them are still missing!	There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?	Maybe they are!
Bullshit.	Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!	What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.	Someone has to do something.	Don't push it this time.  If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that.
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!	Martin, this is kind of an official meeting	Perfect.  Look at this ---
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.	What?
Martin, it could be anything.	What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?	Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
Affirmative.  Can you get your chopper airborne?	10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.	Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.	What for?	There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.	That's it?	That's it.  Just do it, all right?	10-4,   soon as I can raise him.	If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!	Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?	Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
Where the hell is Air One?	That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.	Did he raise the Kids?	Last transmission said ten juve- niles.	Yeah?  Then what?	Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.	Did you say Cable Junction?	That's what he said.	When?	1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.	Shouldn't he be at home?
Can I go swimming?	No.  Find your brother, okay?
Some people.	What's daddy doing?
Can I go with you today?	You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
Hi Dad.	Hiya yourself.
Hang on!	Dad!  Dad!	I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's okay....
They made me go with them.	Sure they did....
Is that me?	That's you.	I've never been supercargo.
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.	Now I really want to see it.	You going to fool around with Mike?  Well, I'm not doing anything with him.
I told you, remember?	Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
What's wrong?	Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
It killed her.  It ate her.	Shh.  Shhh....
We're going to die.	It's all right, we're okay.
How old is your cousin?	Seventeen.  She's a senior.	I'm not crazy about blind dates.
My cousin will be here tomorrow.	Great.
You're not going out right away, are you?	Waiting for Andy.	I want you to meet my cousin.	I will, I will.
She just likes to tease.  I think she really likes you.	Great.
Mike!  Are you going out?	Maybe.
Did you ever see a dolphin?	Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.	Great!
Whoops, almost lost one.  Can't play with the dolphins without skis....	Ready?	Hang on, hang on...Okay, go.
Terry!  You okay?	Help!  Help!	Okay, okay, coming....
Get a dance yet?	Nope.	Me neither.	Who'd you ask?	Tina Wilcox.	You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.	Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.	That's a crock of shit.	I know.
No class.	None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
That's what I want -- a gaff rig.	Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
Anyone know what time it is?	3:30.
Maybe it's gone.	They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  More, with this wind.	Shut up.	I can't stop thinking!
The wind drift is lateral.	What's that mean?	Sideways -  For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....
Take a break for a minute, okay?	Huh?
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?	Next week.	With you, everything's next week. I want to go skiing soon.  Tomorrow?
Come on back up here!	Nope.	Give me back my hat!	Double nope!
You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?	Just like this.	What about sailing?	The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.	It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
What about the others?	They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.	What're we going to do in the mean time?	I dunno.  We'll think of something.
But first, a little juice....	And second?	Mmmmmm.	Wait a minute.  Promise me something.	Anything.  Anything.	That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.	You got it.
Right after, the Kids went out?	What Kids?  Who went out?	All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.	Mike?  Our Mike?	Yep.  Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.	I'm going.
Hurry, please.	What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
Be careful....	Anything?
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.	Figure they split?	Happens every season -- someone takes off.  Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting.
How much longer?	Until we find something.	I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry.  And cold.  And most of all, bored.
About damn time.	What the hell is it?
What is it?	Power line.	Oh, great.
It comes here from Cable Junction.	Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.	Now you're talking.  Let's get out of here before we do find something.
What's the lighthouse?	It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....	Great.  I got some wine.
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.	Is there something I don't know about?
We'll be over by the lighthouse.	I'll be right there.  Wait up.
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.	I'm not sure I can.	It'll be fun, come on!	Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....	No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.	That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.	You do everything your parents tell you?	No.	Good.  I'll be on the dock at eight.  Eight o'clock, everybody!
I thought you were grounded.	I can go out if I want to.
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!	Name it.
I don't care.	I love it.
What's wrong?	We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
Faster!  Faster!	Coming about....
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!	If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!	What about me?	Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....	Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
Heading back?	Might as well.
He's got to help or it won't work.	Sean, baby, please....
I don't think she's such hot stuff.	When are we going out?  You and me?	Not tonight.	You going with Patrick?
Who wouldn't.	Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
They're turning around.	Coming about, then.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.	You always go with Andy.	How was dive class?
Do I have to play with the little kids?	Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
I want Fruit Loops!	Eat Cheerios.	You eat Cheerios.  I want Fruit Loops.
You're going out.	Yeah.	You're going sailing.	Maybe.	Take me.	No.	I want to go with you!	Quiet!  Shhh!	Michael....	Okay, okay.  Close your door.
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.	I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
Yeah.	Would you take him?
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.	Len, can I see you a minute?
I think we got a couple of live ones.	Brody's riding his tower.	Oh, shit.
Wave to my son.	How the hell do we get him down. from there?	Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
Oh, my God....	What the hell is he doing?
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!	He thought he had a good reason.
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.	So?  So?	So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.	Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.
Be reasonable, please....	Forget it, he won't listen.
We're ready for you.	I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?	I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.	Go on, you're tired.	No, I'm fine, thanks.
It hasn't adjusted.	Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
Don't feel bad.	Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
Go on, Doctor.	No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.	It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.	I can get it.
Absolutely.  Good idea.	With those camera lights and...	He's going with you, Doctor.	No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.	And Philip will be there to film it.  Now that's the end of it!
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.	Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
I'll need more men to look.	Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.	We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.	I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
What you're saying is we have a Great White shark in the lagoon.	And a missing man.
What's your plan, Brody?	It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
It's Miller time!	You buying?	Sure am.	Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
You see the three-quarter socket?	Yeah.  Down there.	Shit.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?	No.	Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.	She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.	Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.	How many sharks have you killed?	Me?  I don't know.  Twenty, thirty.  I love them, think they're the greatest.
Thank you.	Want another one?
Well, not much longer to go.	What is it, 97 days?	Till this opens, not our wedding.	Hope I make it through both.	You will.  I'll see to it.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.	They're acting very strange suddenly.	Pre-opening jitters.	I guess.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.	Don't forget you have your brother.	Yeah.	See you later.
That macho pompous English --	Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.	My imagination isn't that good.	Honey, I gotta go.	Okay, bye.
You called, Doctor?	Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.	How come?	I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.	And what else is bothering you?	... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.	Yeah, you really don't like him.	I don't like what he does.	It's his work.	He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.	Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?	I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?	Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?	No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.	Not enough loving.	Get out of here!
They're coming with us?	We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
Where's the rubber band?	Look, Michael... you don't have to come.	I don't have a choice.
What do I do now?	Take a deep breath and hold it.	That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.	Just put your mask on.
Honey... you all right?	No.	Are you scared?	Yes.
Damn it!	Hi, baby.	Baby goddamn scared me to death!	They just wanted to say hello.	... Friggin' fish.
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.	That's a lot of ground to cover.	I know, I built it.  I've just never seen it this way.
It's romantic down here.	Oh, yeah.  Very.	You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.	Let's not talk about that now, okay?
What's wrong?	Nothing.
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?	... Electrical connection malfunctioning.	You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?	That we swim.	Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.	Michael, the sub's dead.	Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.	Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.
Where are you going?	Up.	And leave me down here???	Make up your mind.	What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.	I talked you into this?	I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.	Are you coming...?	No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming!  You'd think you're gonna leave me?
You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.	Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
You all right?	I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?	I'm okay.
Michael...	It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
How the hell did it get in here?	God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?	Don't think about it.  It's over.	It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
You're going down there again?	Yes.	After what happened to us?	I know I can capture it.	Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac.
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?	I got it on sale.  A real steel.	Here.	What's that?	Bracelets.
Fine piece of engineering.	Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.	Thank you.
Kathryn...	Yes?
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?	It's easier to lure sharks at night.	Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
Change your mind?	No.	You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.	No, you're not.
I can use a shot of what he's got.	... Me, too.
After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.	Sounds wonderful.	We'll go to Palm Springs, Death Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water.
You want me to stay?	Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.	Sean, that's right...
Finally.	How's your patient?	Recovering nicely.	Me, too.
Mmmm... you smell good.	You don't.	It's my new perfume.  Great White, the Man-Eater.
They said you'd be here.	What's up?	I need more pressure in the shark tank.	Okay.	I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?	Sure.  Let's go.
No, we'll go through here.	... Mean through the tubes?	Yes.  It's faster.	No,  I'm not going through there.	Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?	I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.	They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.	I don't want to see them, Kathryn.	Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.	... He ought to put him in here.	It's too soon to move him.	So tell Calvin.	I did.  He wants it on exhibit.	Well, that's why you got it.
Honey, what is it?	Hydrophobia...	Michael, take deep breaths.	I have to get out of here.	Come on.	I can't take water, Kathryn.	Yes, you can.	I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --	It's a shark's tooth!	So?	It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.	That's just it, Michael.  We don't!	What do you mean, we don't?	This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!	Thirty feet???
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?	I don't understand.
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?	That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.	You wanted to know about a cave?
Somebody better get down there!	It's all controlled from the Control Room.
Come on!	You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
How is he?	Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.	... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.	... Okay.
That's right.	Who's going to do it?	Me.	Michael, you're not going down there.	I am.  You're not.	But you --	It's a construction job.  I'm the only one that can do it.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.	I want that shark, Kathryn.	You don't have to prove anything.	Only to myself.
Are you okay?	I'm  fine.
Go where?	On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.	Nobody told me.	I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?	They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.	Fine.  Have them do some.	I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.	Yes, aren't we all.
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.	Make this quick!
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.	Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?	Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.	I thought they were clever.	I can have them walk backwards.	No, no.  That won't do.	I told you, something's upset them.	Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.	I'm sorry.	Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
Unhappy combination.  Most likely one's inside the other.	Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --	That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.	I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.	That's preposterous!
You can get killed!	I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.	Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.	No!	It'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.	Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!	Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.	It's one of the world's greatest creatures.	A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!	The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...
I will.	Well, then I'm going to film it.	Like hell!	"Make a lovely item for ""Good Morning, America"""
I want that shark alive.	So do I, love.
You look like an orange worm.	Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.	What in hell is that?
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.	We're taking that shark alive!	Let's hope he knows that.	I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!	Why?	Because I don't trust you, that's why.
I insist you get rid of that bomb.	Afraid I can't do that.	You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!	Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
How's sleeping beauty?	Still sleeping.	Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.	Should be coming out of it soon.	Just watch it when he does.
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.	Thanks for helping.	Not at all.	Why are you?	I like it when they wake up.	So do I.  But for different reasons.	And I like you.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.	Skillful?  I missed my first shot.	Some miss all their shots.	Somebody could have gotten hurt.	That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.	You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.	Philip.	Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.	That's because I am the shark.	We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.	The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
I think that you and I are natural enemies.	And here I thought I was charming you.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.	Get ready to go.	Believe me, I am.	Brian, he's coming around!
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.	Thanks to you.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.	Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...	How'd it get in here?!
He's big as a bloody bus!	The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.	She, Mister Hutton.	He.  She.  Let's blow the bitch up!
A piece of pie on Sunday.	The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
I think they'll come out now.	They still seem nervous.	I know.
He's a young one.	And big for his age.
When did this happen?	Ten minutes ago.
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.	Don't blame yourself.	I should have never listened to Calvin.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...	Not good enough.	We got it to live for ten hours. That's some kind of record.
Give me a ride?	Sure.	'Preciate it.
Musclehead?	He's missing.	Hope with none of my girl friends.
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?	Sure.  No problem.	Thanks.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?	Someone's looking for you.
Hi, Mike.	How you doing, Kelly?	I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.	Better than catching Sean's herpes.
So, you just get here?	Yeah, from Boston.	I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.	Massachussettans aren't.	'Course they're also so rich.	... Massachussettans aren't.	How long you staying?	I don't know, it depends.	You like Florida?
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.	Well, wait till you see the rest.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?	Depends on big brother.	I'm a water-skier.	Are you really?	Sure am.	That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.	How come?	Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
Well, I needed a cold shower.	Come on!  Check this out!
This is where to be.  High and dry.	And alone.
You were great out there!	Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?	As always.
Herpes?	Why you sonuvabitch...
Sean, do you have herpes?	No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
Besides that.	I don't know, what else is there?	I know!  We can take the gondola ride!	The one that goes underwater?	Yes, it's great!	No, Kelly, I don't want to...	Come on, it's fun!	Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?	You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.	No, think of something else.	Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.	I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
Isn't this fun!	Can hardly wait to do it again.
Told you you'd like it.	Now what's this do?	Goes up.
No...  It can't be.	What, hon?
Let's go, let's go!	It's okay, Sean.	Take it up.	He's diving!
Take it up!	SEAN!
The space shuttle has landed!	Hold still, damn it!	What're you doing later?	Taking my boyfriend to the airport.	I thought I was your boyfriend.
I don't talk that way.	Remember, skiers stay up longer.	Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!	I am serious.
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!	Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Ahhh, ahhh...	Now what?	Gotta sneeze.	Don't you dare.	Can't help it... ahh...
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!	Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
Did you see that?	What?	On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.	That?	Yes, there is goes.	It's disappeared.
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.	Hey.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?	Calvin said it was all right.	Yeah, well I didn't!	Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Make sure you put this back.	Aww, can't I keep it?
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.	Precisely.
Watch it, Brody.  You're ruining the shot.	Kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  Why don't you throw in another shark?
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.	Yeah, poor bastard.	I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.	Hey, I don't want to hear.	That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.	Buzz off.	I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.	Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.	Thanks.  Bullshot.	So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?	No, South Georgia.	What the hell's there?	Polar bears.	Polar bears in Georgia???	South Georgia, Antarctica.	Oh...	The world's southern most reaches.	How come you're so brave with all this stuff?	Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.	Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?	Reach for the limit I always say.	I'll remember that, my Lordship.
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.	That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?	It's large enough...
How far away is filter number four?	Five hundred yards.	You have a man near it?
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?	You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
I'll go with you.	No way.	I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.	I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.	Always do.
What kind of trouble?	It's not closing, Mike.	That's impossible.	I know.  But we show it's not closing.	Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.	Right, Mike.
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.	All right, hit those lights too.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!	Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!	Look great, don't I?	Got a job for me?	Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.	Sharks???	In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.	... I'll go to McDonalds.
How'd you do in school?	Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.	Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.	So was Dad.
Took it this morning.	He needs a haircut.	Yeah, right.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?	Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.	Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?	Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.	That's Dad...
He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean?  We were lucky to grow up the way we did.	Who's grown up?	Gee, it's good to see you!	I want to see Kathryn.	Just find your own.  Like Dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea.
Come on, let's go.	Something wrong?	You know Overman?
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.	Don't hurry back.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.	It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.	You and Kathryn gonna stay here?	This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.	Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?	Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.	Yeah, he'll really go for that.	It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
She still talking to you?	We're in love.	Sure.	No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.	Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --	Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.	That bugger moves fast.	Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.	I wouldn't mind going down with her.	She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
You want to show this?	Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
You'll spoil her.	That's what grandmas are for.
Thea....	Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.	Don't bother Hoagie....
It has its virtues.  It hasn't fallen down yet....	Watch me, Grandma....
Come on, sweetheart....	But you always let me....	Not today.  Come on, Thea....
Daddy, why can't I...?	Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....	I don't want to.  I want to swing....
You're welcome.  I was the one who cried.	Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee....	My tea set.  I got my tea set.  Thank you....
Can I make sandwiches...?	Yes, you can make sandwiches....
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....	Yes, I did.	It's time for tea, Grandma.
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....	He told me you both did....
He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way....	He was doing his job....	It was a piece of wood.  A shitty piece of wood.  It's not fair....
Where are you going?	Nowhere....
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....	Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
I've always wanted to ride one of those....	No way....	Chicken....
Like mother, like son....	My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
It sure is good to be home....	It sure is....
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....	We forgot to stop at the store.
Make a list.	We need milk....	Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....	We need beer....	I'll be right there.
I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone.	Tell Matt he should be here....
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....	My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.	Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....	I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
How come it's my responsibility?	Because....
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....	We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?	Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....
What the hell are we arguing about?	I don't know...You...I don't know.
No fair, I'm not armed.	Then don't come any closer.	Turn it off....	No....	Off....	I have work....	I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder.  I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy.
Close the door.	They're at the beach....
Where have you been...?	What's wrong?  What happened?	Thea was attacked by a shark....
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....	But it went away...We would have known....
You knew...?	It went away....
Sweetheart....	She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....	Where is she?	How could you do that?  Your own daughter....	Where's my mother?	I don't know....
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?	I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....	I'm not on vacation....
It'll grow on you.	I like it.  Really....
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....	Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?	Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....	I can't help it....	I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....	I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....	Henny Youngman....	You caught me....	You're not interfering, Ellen....
You want to try your hand at something...?	I'd be afraid of losing....
At least he doesn't have a beard....	Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
All he did was kiss me....	It's beginning....
Beginning of what?	Whatever happens next.....	I always thought when I grew up I'd know what to do about things like this...I don't even know if he's serious....
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.	Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....	Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....	I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together.  What are you going to do now?	We'll be there....	You make sure they come?
Michael!  This thing working?	You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....	Michael!
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....	Spent it all on beer....
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....	You have something to say about everything....
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?	What difference does it make?  It's here....
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.	Bang sticks are like yelling at it....	We're going down.  All of us....
They won't kill it....	We'll divert it...We'll do something....
I hope the man knows what he's doing....	He knows what he has to do....
Stop that....	Stop what?	That....	I'm not doing anything.
That hurt....	Serves you right.  Will you please stop....	Can't help myself....
I see what you're doing....	I'm hungry, Mom....	Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers....
Are you all right?	Adds flavor....
We don't want any....	Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
The fish.  Check it....	You check it....	I'm on the phone....
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....	He heard that.	Good.
A big one....	A small one...Your brother won't be here....
Don't be late.	I won't....
In a minute....	What's going on?
Yes!	You can stay in my room.	I'd like that.  I need to be away from here.
Can I ride one sometime...?	It's too dangerous....
I never....	Where's the lady who brings the soda?
I like Grandma's cooking....	Thank you....
No, no...It's too dangerous....	Mommy lets me....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....	I'm still five....
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....	You're silly....
You're coming, aren't you...?	Who's coming?
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.	It's not nice to be evasive.
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?	The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
I almost forgot....	I didn't.
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.	Thanks for the consultation....
I'll be in to read you a story.	Good night, Daddy....
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.	I'll miss you....
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....	Mother....
Sit down, Ma....	You guys must be starving....
I want you to get out of the water....	What?	I want you to give up that terrible job.	Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....	You're damn right I'm serious....	I'm just getting started....	I don't want you in the water anymore....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....	I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....	It picked Sean...It killed your father....	Dad died from a heart attack....	He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....	Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....	It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....
Oh, I didn't mean....  I'm being such a Grandma....	Come on, I'll show you around.
I didn't mean to start that....	Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....	You were a monkey....
All you all right?	I'm fine....
How are you doing?	Okay.	We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go.
I'll be all right, Michael.	Good.  So will I....
Nothing out of the ordinary....	Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
I want you to give up your work....	Mom, please don't start that again....	You could teach...You could....	I'm not going to quit now....	You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water....
You're having a good time....	I am.
I enjoy his company....	I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him....	He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous....
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....	You're not a pain in the ass....	Will you let me finish.  I've been working on this all day.
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....	Good.
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....	I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....	No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....	You just got here....	Children are never satisfied.  I have my house, my friends, my job...My life, Michael.  I have to live it. Besides, I'll be back.  Now show your mother what a good dancer you are.
It's late....	Trying to write our report....	You look tired....	I'm fine....
You and Sean used to make....	I have to get this finished.	I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....	I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....	I'm worried.. We haven't had our....	There's nothing to worry about....	I'm your mother.  It's my job....
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....	I don't want to talk about that.	It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.	I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
You hungry?	No.
It got him....	Why'd you come out here?	Why'd you take the boat?
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.	There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
Promise me you'll be all right....	Promise me....	I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael....	I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
No....	First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.	You must get bored easily.
Can you just go off...?	I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
Flies the plane....	Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.	Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....	I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.	I always listen to my feelings....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....	It could have been an accident....	It was no accident....	I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....	When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming....
Depends on where you want to go....	Doesn't matter....
How can you just take the plane like this?	Boss' day off...Take the wheel....	I can't....	Sure you can....	I don't know how....	No one does till they learn....
What are you doing?	If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
It's just like driving a car....	Where do I pull off...?	You're doing fine.  I'll keep you out of trouble.  Relax....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....	One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....	You're not going to tell me, are you?	Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....	You're impossible....	They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....	The plane's turning....
How do you like flying?	It's wonderful....
What's wrong?	Nothing....
I'm fine.	No, you're not....	I'm terrific... Come on....
You promised me a drink....	Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People don't have anything to do with it....	The kind with an umbrella in it....	Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life....
A drink with an umbrella in it....	A big one....	A big one....
Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....	You're not going to bet it all....	All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?	No!
Would you suffer through a dance with me?	You'll be sorry.
I have two right feet.	Good.  I have two left....
Our little island seems to agree with you....	I have my own little island.	But it gets cold in winter....
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....	That's hard to imagine....	I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while....
I could take some time off....	You're always taking time off....	I like to travel....
I'll nick the boss' plane again....	What?	I borrow it without telling him....	Won't you get in trouble...?	Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....	There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....	There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....
I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.	Why?	Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....	I'm sorry...I....	There's nothing to be sorry about.	The whole idea is preposterous....
You sure you don't need glasses?	My vision is perfect....
I tried to tell you...I tried....	Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
I can't....	Yes you can....
They had them on the big one....	I have coffee in the thermos.	I'm too young for coffee.  Can I drive the plane?
I'll get it back next time.	How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?	The wind does that.  Ever been to the Bahamas before?
Want to go for a little ride?	I do....
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'	You're the man who drives the plane.
You the architect?	I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
Hurry!	Just like that?
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?	Yes I can....	I own the airplane.  I can do whatever I want.  I'm the boss.
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....	We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
I hope she's a good sailor....	A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....	You got a better idea...?
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....	She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
What do you mean, it'll find her?	She said it was coming....
Grab your socks....	You sure you know how to do this.	Hell, no.  What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....	It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....	Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...	Get her started....
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....	They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
Keep it steady....	Aye, aye, Captain....
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....	Good news travels fast....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....	The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....	What's that....?
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?	I fly elephants for smugglers....
Can't this thing go any faster?	Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
Come on, Hoagie....	All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
What happened?	Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
The damn thing is going to have our asses....	It needs more time to charge.
Matt?	Tell Thea I'm sorry....
I don't know what the hell to say....	You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
Yeah....	Still chasing fish?	Still tagging conch?	We'll be done pretty soon....	Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?	Inch by inch....	How's Ellen?
She has good days and bad...I don't know....	She's a tough lady....	I wish there was something I could do....	She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....	Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....	Oh, boy....
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....	Feathers all over the place....	It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.
Let me speak to Ellen....	I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....	You too, Michael....
Stop farting around....	Stop busting my hump....	Try the area around the wreck....
How many...?	Will you leave me alone...?	You tagging them...?	I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....	You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....	The females have eggs....	We'll pass around cigars....
We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....	If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....	If you'd leave me alone, I'd be able to get my work done....
I know how to tag a damn conch....	The readings suck....	Maybe it's the tags that suck....	I made them, man....	I stuck them on, man....	You didn't stick them on right....	If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....	A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....	You couldn't find your ass with both hands....	You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....	Hey!	Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....	Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....	Put me down....	They won't fight with me....	Put me down, damnit....
Maybe I missed you too....	Where the hell's the beer...?
Bad boy....	I didn't do it on purpose....
Sharp shirt, Jake....	May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
Office of Naval Research has some money....	Forget it....	Money is money....	They put bombs on dolphins....	I know a guy who got money from them to study eels....
A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....	It's not a bad life, Jake....	You're afraid of the competition out there....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....	You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
How many?	Stop busting my hump....	Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....	I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
I wish you wouldn't say that....	What?	Spade's a garden tool....
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....	Holy shit!
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....	Don't say anything about this to my mother....
Where is everybody?	Down here....
What happened to Clarence and...?	Gave them the day off....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?	As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?	We don't write up anything until we're done....	Okay.. .we're done, man....	When we got the grant....	When I got the grant.....	When I signed on....	When I invited you...	We got it together, Jake....	Okay...we got it together....	We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....	We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.	My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....	The shark will get it for us.
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.	So did I....
I don't know shit about electronics....	You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....
You sure you've done this before?	Lots of times....
And it's always worked?	So far..
What are we getting out of this old bucket?	What she's got.  Nine knots....	Shit....
How long have you known Hoagie?	What?	How long have you known Hoagie?	What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?	How long?	As long as he's been here....
Bring her to starboard.	How long has he been here...?	Who?	Hoagie.	I don't remember.  One day he was just here....	What do you know about him?
What's so funny about that?	You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
Bring her about.  We're headed in the wrong direction....	Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off....	Half don't...Bring her about....	I am...You must know something about him....	He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....	I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
We lost it....	Maybe the gear crapped out....	If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....	Maybe it's gone....
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?	Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
I'm coming...How close is it?	Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
It's my turn in the barrel, man....	You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....	I don't like it....	I didn't ask you to....	What about Carla's gig?	I'm going down, Jake....	She's not going to like it....
You getting a reading on them?	I live to hear the sound...You all right?	What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?	Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....	How come only me?	Maybe he only likes white meat....	Funny, Jake...Funny.	Just trying to be helpful....
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....	'It was so ugly...It was so big....'	'A Moray eel....'	'Snuck up on me....'	'It got us in hot water...We should have been there for Carla....'
Shit....	Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....	Shove it....	You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'	Stop that!	You don't like my voice...?	I don't like the song.	Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
You told me what?	Screw you, Jake....
Holy Christ....	Mom....
What the hell are you doing?	I've got to get to her....	You jump, you'll kill yourself....
If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.	Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....
All the time....	It'll work....	Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....	If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.	The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....	I forgot my rubber gloves.  Let's do it.
Your equipment has crapped out again....	My equipment doesn't crap out....
I'll do it, Jake.	No way....	It's my fault...I have to....	We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....	Jake.	I'm the one who wanted to study it....
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....	Don't flatter yourself....
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.	In a few minutes....
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....	Here it comes....	Who grows more beautiful....	Here comes the cow ca-ca....	More beautiful with each passing minute...	I told you....	Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here....	Oh, Jake...	Happy birthday, darling. ...
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....	I just want to make an honest woman of you....	I'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair.
She's in management....	I'm training to....	Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....	I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
Woman has taste....	When he has a pillow over his head....	You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see....
That bad, huh?	We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....	Anything to do before I go home?
That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.	Good night, Polly....
Where's Lenny?	Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.	Cow tipping?	Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.	I'll take care of it.	Deputy Brody will take care of it personally.
Did you like that, Mama?	Yes.	I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?	What?	You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.	Oh no--	Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.	No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-	What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.	Yeah?	Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?	Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...	Well, with me, it's all right. I'll kiss you and hug you. You see if I don't.  Now Mama, Mama, stop now. You're gettin' kittenish. Mama, listen, I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage. You know, with this show. I'm gonna sing it jazzy. Now get this ...
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?	"I'm afraid it's the ""van"" again."	The van?	Is it your vehicle?	No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?	Only me and Mom ..	How about any guys on your staff?	We only got one .. He doesn't drive.
Did you bring it with you?	I hope I'm not intruding?	Be my guest. What you got?	Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..	You heard. Look for the knife.
"No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a ""tourist."""	"""Welcome to Eureka."""
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?	Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?	Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
What about that kid, Ross?	Oh, shit. Of course. The kid.  <u>Travis</u>. Find that kid and get the knife off him. He's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. Well, go on, get on with it. Whatta you staring at?
What do you think?	I think you're here all day.
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?	The <u>dogs</u>?	Two dogs. He should do the dogs.
Yeah, he can go ...	Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
Who is who?	A professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of Africa ..
Not for me ..	What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..	Since when did you drink diet soda?
How's the new residence?	O.K.	What does that mean?	Not too good in daylight ..	"C'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted.  You're gonna love it. This is ""God's Country,"" John."
What time is it?	"Seven thirty-five .. Here, ""Town Gets Top Cop."" I was gonna pin it to your wall."
"Why so coy about the word ""frozen""?"	Because, don't get into it ...	There's nothing in the files?	Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
"It's an ""unsolved."" They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case."	I already did. What's his problem?
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?	It's a method for quitting smoking.
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..	Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?	Because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. I'm down to 10.
You want my advice?	Maybe?	"Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that ""bye-bye."" Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief .."
You gotta stop smoking ..	I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...	"I don't mean this ""system"" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can .."	How'd you do it, old man?	Someone bet me a dollar ..	A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
What do you mean?	Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.	What do you mean, Ross?
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?	"Why don't you dump the ""Fat Lady?"""	Because I dislike her too much ..	O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.	No you don't. That's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. That's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>.
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.	I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
Where is everyone?	I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?	Thank Christ we got a witness.	Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?	<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..	No, you didn't.	Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..	No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.	We're going.	Forget it. They got stringent hyg- iene rules. He's long gone in lime.
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..	So am I. But where's my money?	Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..	Pay me, and I shut up.	I haven't got it.	Then give me that Zippo.	Why?	I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.	I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.	"I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called ""cash."""
What do you want it for?	To throw out of the window.
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..	It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?	I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.	You want me to stop the car?
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.	"How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over ""Jennifer"" for months?"	They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.	Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.	That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.	Listen to me saying what?	I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..	For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?	"We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is ""Jennifer <u>Eight</u>."""
That isn't what you said before.	I was wrong.
You believe me, don't you?	What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
Did he shut you down?	All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?	I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..	I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
Did I say he did?	You looked like you did?	No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.	He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
Why's she blind, Bro?	Car accident.
God, it pisses me off, Ross.	No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
Stop it.	I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?	John, <u>stop</u> <u>it</u>. The case is on its ass, you're closed.  C'mon, let it go for once .. Have a drink. C'mon, relax, drink your beer ..
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..	Just makes to so God damned mad ..	You're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. You're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide? .. Not many people could do that in a place like this .. And you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case? .. I mean, stop me if I'm going up the wrong nostril ..
She wasn't lying about the van.	Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..	Sure.	You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?	"Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my ""Nervous Tick"" ..."
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.	"I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? ""Good-bye, Princess,"" & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?"	I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.	You don't really believe this?	"<u>One hundred fucking per cent</u>! .. And you know why? Coz I never told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that good enough for the ""committee?"""
Well .. I didn't know that ..	No .. You didn't know that ..
That's a very stupid question, Ross.	I'm asking it.	How the hell do I know <u>who</u>? Some jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.
Ease off, John ..	<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.	Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.	Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
I dunno what I can do to help you?	I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..	What about Citrine?	Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..	Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..	Are you sure you didn't call?
You got a quiet phone somewhere?	Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?	That's just what I wanna find out.
Jesus. What are you doin?	I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
What exactly you doing, John?	I'm going up to the institute.	Now?	"This ""cop"" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas."
Listen, you don't havta come?	Hey ..
Where's your watch?	I guess by the bed.	It's twenty of three.
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..	Bits.	"What d'you mean, ""bits."""
Policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. Look at me. Gut in its fifties. Balls in their six- ties. And feet in their eighties ..	<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
What if we need a back up?	We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.	You ain't going in alone?	That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living ..
Why did he ask if it was frozen?	That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
What is that?	Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
How do you know her hair's black?	Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.	What is all this Jennifer stuff?
"Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think ""Jennifer,"" and this lady got hit by the same guy?"	I don't see that at all ..
I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..	Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. He worked a lotta time on this.	I thought it was Taylor's case?	Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
What do you want me to do, Chief?	I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?	Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.	Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?	He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.	Have you got a match on the bullet?	No.	Have you got a print from the hand?	No, Sir.	It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..	It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.	"She's <u>not</u> ""missing."" Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick, she's still not missing. You got no case, John."	If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..	I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..	We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..	We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!
"I'm shutting you down on this ""blind thing,"" John."	Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?	Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?	Three or four.	I'm talking, outside the girl?	Once.	Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?	That's bullshit,	"He says, you freaked one of em out?  ""Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous"" .."
"I never asked if he could ""see."" I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?"	And did they?	No.
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.	I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?	Coz I'm <u>short of men</u> & Ang- elo won't do it .. Who ever I got free first - <u>you</u> <u>get</u> ..
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..	You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.	I am calm .. <u>I am calm</u> ..
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.	Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
What does that mean, Sergeant?	Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one.
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?	My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?	Your predecessor. He did- n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T ..
Is this normal?	Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
Did he get you the job?	I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..	Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?	No .. But we have a theory ..	Kid told me he didn't take it?	Maybe he's lying to you?
Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..	How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..
.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..	What are you looking for?	Vehicle references.	Wrong cabinet.
"His blind friend got ""attacked."" Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper."	<u>You</u> put it in there.	I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.	Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!	Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!	Bullshit.	Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..	Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.	Just walk away from me, Taylor ..
You don't know what you done, Taylor.	<u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
"I know what a ""witness"" is."	Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..	He ain't offerin me shit.
"I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross ""Freddy"" in my life .."	I've heard you call him Freddy.	You <u>haven't</u>. And you got no voice in here, Taylor, <u>so keep it shut</u>.
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?	I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..	Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?	I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?	Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there.
Yes, Sir.	As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?	Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.	I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?	I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.	Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..	What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
You must have some idea about him.	When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?	No.	Why not? You heard my voice?
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?	I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
The elevator wasn't working?	No, it has a mind of its own.
Can I see your hands?	My hands?
Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?	No. Except he smoked. Like you.	Me?	Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?	No.	Lotta scratch-marks on your door?	Sometimes I look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
Did Amber have a dog?	Yes.	What color was it?	I don't know.
Have you been here long?	No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..	I'm sorry. I'll get my things.	No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?	"I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a ""hollow car?"""	"Well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded ""hollow"" .."
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?	Of course I would ..
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.	It was probably the wind.
What are you reading?	Hamlet. Have you read it?	No.	You should. It's wonderful.
Are you wearing a uniform?	No.	Oh.	Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.	I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..	"There's no one ""looking at you"" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me."
Are you married?	Was. But I don't like to talk about it.	You just asked me to ask you questions.	I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.	"""Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."""	"Yeah, that'll do .. Is that ""Hamlet?"""	No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
I don't know, I haven't read much. I don't think poetry's my kinda thing?	Do you pray?	Pray?	You said, you were in the bad lands?	No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers?  He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.
Sorry?	.. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee ..
She runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..	Have you known her long?	I was married to her sister ..
I know what you're like ..	How d'you know what I'm like?	Ross told me.	Really? What did he say?	He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.	He said that? What else did he say?	Just your age.	Which is what?	Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..
I have to talk to you, Helena.	I know.	You know? How do you know?	Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
Has he got your aunt's address?	I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..	Who?  Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.?
You're looking worried again, Helena?	No I'm not.	"You're looking more worried now than when you ""decided to stop worrying""?"	Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
Why can't I stay with you?	It's not possible right now.	Why?	Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.	I'm going back to the institute.	No .. not now ..
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..	I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.	<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..	Why does he want to kill me?	Coz he thinks you're a witness.	I can't identify him ..	He don't know that. I didn't.	Then why didn't he kill me?
He doesn't need my help.	I know about alcohol, John.	You do?	I'm blind because my father drank.
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..	I wanna be near you ...
I think they're gonna arrest me.	I don't want them to arrest you.	It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
What are you doing, Travis?	I been told to take your car in, Sir.	Why?	I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
You got a warrant for this?	Yes, Sir.	Who sought the warrant?	The man from the F.B.I.
Interview over, Blattis ...	C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..	Grateful for your candor, Sir.	Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..	Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?	Come on, Michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. I told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it ..
A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?	You find something curious in that?	Yeah, I guess I do.	"Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't ""blind"" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left .."	And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?	No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
When did John divorce?	Two or three years ago.	What was she like?	Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.	What does that mean?	You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
You think he still loves her?	Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?	Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
You think John would like it?	I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
How you doing on those shoes?	Don't mix very well with beer.
Is that Margie?	I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.	Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?	Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.	Freddy's new obsession ..
So tonight she confesses?	Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..	Even better.
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..	She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
He's happy, darlin ..	"I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the ""element"" is a bad idea."
Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?	Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
You want something, darling?	I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
She married some English prick.	He's not that bad of a guy ..?	Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.
"Hey, we're not talking ""talk"" tonight."	No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
Just easy on the words you're putting in my face, Sergeant ..	Whass going on here?
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..	Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.	"He tells her, ""bye-bye,"" and she gets ""attacked."" Well, give me a fucking break! There <u>is</u> no ""Ser- ial Killer."" Stick her name up in neon, there's still no Serial kil- ler! And I ain't the only one say- ing it. Everyone in this building is saying it. And I mean <u>everyone</u>."
Shut up, King Jay ..	No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
You can drive down there, Sir ..	I'm already walking. Where is it?
On the infill. The guy from L.A.'s just gone down there ..	He has? .. What's he doing here?	He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait- ed a good while. Said he'd go down and take a look. I hope that's O.K.
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?	A derelict.
Where do you fit in, Trimble?	His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?	Don't annoy me, Travis.	No, Sir.
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir	"Whatta you mean, ""horrible?"""	I think I've found a hand.
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?	Ask him.
Don't ever stop fucking me!	Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.	Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!	Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.	I know about the bachelor party.
Who told you?	One of the accountants.
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?	And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?	"""Dad says we gwan sleep on it."	Ugh!	Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.  Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.	I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.	Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.	That's right.	King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!	Okay, this is working.	You are not a loser.
"Who said anything about ""loser?"" Where do you get this word ""loser?"""	I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?
Now.	Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --	Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --	Well, no you didn't --	You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?	It's a plan --  -- _ 51.
This can't be happening to me.	Jerry!  Do something --
I just heard.	What do I do?  How do I spin this?	Oh honey.  It's spun.
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --	Could you just stop moving?	I have to finish my job --	Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --	Look, I don't want a --	"It's not ""love me.""  It's not ""trust my handshake.""  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be ""confusion"" about that."	Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..	What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?	"I think you added the ""brutal."""
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.	-- stop --
Listen to me!	No.	It's over --
Didn't hear it.	There is something missing here.	You've never been alone and you can't be alone --	Listen to me, it's over.
No one has ever dumped me.	I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.	No.
Oh Jerry.	You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
"Wait.  Did I just say ""hon"" to him?"	Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Don't let him stay up too late.	Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.	Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
He's asleep, right?	Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?	Still going.
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?	I see what you're saying.	Wait.  What do you mean?
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.	"""It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings..."	Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.	"""Something in the way.  Yeah."""
Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.	"Just be friendly and say ""no comment."""	Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered.
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.	Oh come on --	This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.	You're imagining it.
... this is... uh... too funny...	They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!	Bill, Rod, wait --
Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.	Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
No no...	Oh, tell the story.
Can I help?	Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --	I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.	Hmm.  Pretty good.	Now what did you lose?	My son... my mind...
Well, thanks.	Well, take care.	And have fun at your bachelor party.
Oh no.	No no. I knew.	Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.	"No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called ""my twenties."" See you later."
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.	You think so?	Oh tsht. Yes.	I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...	"-- the part about ""we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm"" --"
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.	Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
Wonder what he said.	"My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said ""you complete me."" _ 40."
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?	Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --	Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.	No no, I know --
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.	Absolutely.
That took guts.	Same to you.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.	Hello?	Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?	Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
... light.	Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.	We are?	It's all going to work.	I just got goosebumps.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.	Well, I'm happy for you.	Happy for us.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.	Thanks.	Call me later, hon.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?	Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Hey you.	Hi.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?	He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.	"I'm glad you're home.  That ""alone"" thing is... not my specialty..."
Oh my God.	Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
Too bad.	Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.	Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?	And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.	Do you have something to drink?	Sure --
Beer okay?	Yeah, thanks.
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.	Good idea.  Thank you.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --	We will be fine!	-- especially one like this.	And I am...
Truth?	Sure.
Me too.	What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
I'm working with you because of that memo...	Mission... statement...
Well.	Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?	Don't worry about it, boss.	"Oh shit.  You said ""boss."""	Yeah, I did.	Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.	No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.	No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.	I may not sue.
Well, good evening.	Good evening.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.	"Happy. He said ""happy?"""	"Actually he said ""glad."" _ 85."
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.	Plus, you could use that commission.
I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --	You don't have to explain.	Look, the other night, I want to apologize.	Yeah, what happened there.	We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.	I'm relieved you said that.	I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.	Oh good.	You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.	Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.	Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?	Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were...
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.	Bye you guys. _ 88.
"It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, ""it's nobody's fault."" It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --"	Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
Maybe you should call her.	No no no.  I just underestimated her...  her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this?
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?	What?	Let's not tell our sad stories.
Well -- this would be goodnight.	Good night.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.	Same to you.	No.  I have to go in.  I live here.	Right.  I'll come in.	Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?	Oh hell yes.
Oh God.	Easy, easy --
Another time, okay Dorothy?	Fine, I just --	And I appreciate that impulse.
Sure you're okay to drive this?	This rig? Phht.  No problem.	So I'll see you this weekend.
What --	Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
If I said that, would you stay?	No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...	Will you marry me?
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.	Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
And I really don't know your noises yet.	Well, when you wonder, ask me.	Okay... I will...
Why do you love me?	Why do you love me?
It's my fault.	What --	It's not fair to you.  This whole --	Tell me -- let me help --	I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.	Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.	"I don't need you to ""stick."""	You want...	I don't know --	...my soul or something. _ 117.
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.	Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?	I think we made a mistake here.
"What if it's true?  ""Great at friendship bad at intimacy."" I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --"	I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.	I don't like to give up.	"Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, ""responsible""... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break."	What about Ray?
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.	So this break... is a break-up.	Come on, Jerry.  You know this isn't easy for me.  _ 118.
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.	Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
What about medical?	Of course, medical! _ 42.
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.	If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.	You know how much those Well Child exams cost --	Of course I know --
Wait. Where is he?	He's in the living room asleep.
He's coming over.	At eleven at night? _ 70.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.	"Dotty -- this is not ""guy."". This is a ""syndrome.""  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you."	Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
I heard.	No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.	This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.	Thank you.	Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74.
That's the girl I love.	But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.	As opposed to twenty angry women?
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?	Good.	Thanks.
Forgot your keys --	That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.	Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
First you gotta tell me something.	No--
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.	Please, if I start talking --	Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --	Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.	-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.	I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?	It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.	Ten seconds, Rod.	And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...
Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --	We decided to stay with you.
Oh, thank you.	Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.	You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.	It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
Denver is where he should be.	I'll give it everything.	"You know I don't do ""contracts."" But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak."
What happened to Denver?	Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.
Not right now, Jerry.	Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.	Said who?  Sugar?	Hey, I'm learning as I go.	So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?	I'm sorry, I --	I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
"Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your ""my word is stronger'n oak"" thing --"	We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.	Okay.
"Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain ""get killed, catch the ball."" That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!"	Now you want Arizona dollars.	Exactly.  And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look!  And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water.  Say hello to Jerry Maguire --
--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?	Mmm.  Hmm.	It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?	Yes.	"Here it is.  ""Show me the money.""  Show.  Me.  The.  Money. _ 36."
I got it.	Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.	Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
At last I find you.	Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?	Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.	Let's do it again.
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?	I gotta get back to Cushman.	Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they do is ignore me...
You're loving me now, aren't ya?	"I'm not about love -- I'm about ""showing you the money."""
Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.	Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.	Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --	Call me tomorrow.	I might call you later!
You love me now, don't you?	Very much.
Rod --	You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?	What are you doing with me, Rod?	Huh?	Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale!
"See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on ""do not do this"" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!"	Well, boo-fucking-hoo.	The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --	No.	It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.
You are not allowed to act this way.	Why not?
"Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your ""nya nya nya."""	Another drink please.	Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.	Oh my God.
"Did you tell him about the ""ten million for four years?"""	Uh, not today, but --	John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.	I understand your anxiety.	"Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the ""coin.""  It's the..."
--  the kwan.	That's your word?	Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.	"But how did you get ""kwan?"" _ 82."
"I got there from ""coin,"" dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan."	Great word.  Towel?	No, I air-dry.	Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
Is that your porty or mine?	You.
You're telling me to dance.	No, I'm saying to be --
"""Love me love me love me... put me on t.v.""  That's the iconography of rascism, man!"	Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.	Fine.
What's wrong.	Forget it.  Forget it.	No tell me. _ 84.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.	You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
If you get injured, you get nothing.	Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.	It's a risk.
I'll get you some quick work --	Good deal, man.
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.	Rod, get on the camel.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?	Oh, we gonna be friends now?	What do you know about dating a single mother?
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.	Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
"First, single mothers don't ""date."" They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?"	How do I know?	You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?	No, I don't know.	Then you gotta have The Talk.	But I sure don't like that she's leaving.	Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
The kid is amazing.	"No.  A real man does not shoplift the ""pooty"" from a single mom."	"I didn't ""shoplift the pooty.""  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty."	Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
You never had The Talk, did you?	No.	Well, this was another way to go.
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.	I'm a little worried --	I'm worried too.  I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.
We can still take the offer, Rod.	No.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.	Hey, that's my word, okay?
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.	Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.	Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.	What's that supposed to mean?	Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.	"I don't know -- how's ""dedication"" for an answer?"	You don't want to go home, do you?	Why are you doing this to me, Rod?	I'm asking you a question --	No, you're --	I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?
Not everyone has what you have.	Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.	You're jabbing at me. _ 112.
I'm sorry I asked.	No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.	That's an answer.	Damn right.	For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.	"Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really ""friends?"""	Why not --	"Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our ""friends"" hats on --"	I think so.	Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
I don't want to be friends anymore.	Fine.	Beautiful.	We still having dinner in L.A.?	Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
Jerry!  You made it --	Go.  Flee.
Thanks for coming.	I missed ya.  What can I say?
I have to ask.	What --	Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?
You're with the sports people on the plane, right?	Jerry Maguire.  SMI.	Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.	Well.  Good luck with that --
And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships.  I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend?  Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?	I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.	It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it... you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.	Tell me, and then you can sleep.	She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now...
Oh, tell the story.	--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...	Gorgeous.	A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.	That's when you need to cement, and define define define.	Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.	To the pools?	"To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- ""Hurry up, klutz."""	Oh no -- _ 14.
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --	How sad --	But wait...
"Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, ""Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me."" And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said ""yes"" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February."	Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?	Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
How can I make your life better?	I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
You gonna get that --	Not a chance.
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.	Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!	Damn right.
I'll go back to them.	"And say what?  ""Please remove your dick from my ass?!"""
Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.	"What are you talking about -- ""don't get emotional."" If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98."
Marcee --	What DO you stand for???
I'm sorry what I said back there.	Don't be silly.	My husband believes in you.  We're gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.	I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --	Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.	"""Stay calm?""  I'm freakin..."	Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. _ 124.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.	The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
Cronin's okay for lunch?	Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.	Pleasure.
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...	You okay?	I'm fine.  What's up?	I came here to let you go. _ 27.
Pardon me?	Came here to fire you, Jerry.
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...	I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
You...	"You did this to yourself.  You said ""fewer clients.""  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --"
... dick?	Dick.
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?	You'll lose.	You wanted smaller.	I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.	Jerry --	-- and I'll get 'em.	You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...	I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
One-two-three, swing.	Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?	No.	They do, my brother.	I'm not your brother!
Hi.	Hi Ray.
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?	Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.	Let's go the zoo.	Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.	Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.	"You said ""fuck""."	Yeah I know.  I did.
I won't tell.	We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
I don't see any.	Funny.	Funny...   I better go to bed.
What's going on, Jerry?	A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
Show me the animal, Jerry!	Right up ahead, buddy --
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...	I'm scared.  What is it?	It's in a cage.  Do not be scared of...
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.	That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.	Can you be quiet?	What'd I say?
He should have kept his head tucked down.	Shut up!!!	I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth.
ERRR-IIIC!	And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.	A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?	He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
Eric!	Quiet!
This is how you make dinosaurs?	This is how you play God.
Do you think it goes all the way across?	One way to find out.
Oh, my God.	What is it?	A bird cage.
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.	It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...	We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
...once-in-a-lifetime.	We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.	From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!	What?	He says it's a bad idea!	What's a bad idea?
We can't just...	Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
Her new boyfriend.	A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.	"We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should ""accept the inevitable."" You believe that?"
Sorry.	Nothing you haven't seen before.
How much weight have you lost?	Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.	You hate to swim.	People change.
You look good.	So do you.
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.	Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.	No, Dr. Grant says...	Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...	Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?	"Because ""Dr. Grant"" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast."	Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you, don't come crying to me.	Oh, don't worry about that.	What?	Nothing.	What did you say?	Nothing.	What did you say!	Just drop it Paul!
Young adult.	Eric...
That's him. Thats Eric!	I filmed this the morning they left.
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.	No, it's...	I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...	Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
Eric! Are you here?	Eric!
Udesky.	He's this way.
It's not safe.	We have to help him.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.	I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
Well what?	Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.	That one time was just the bumper.	He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.	When did you have it last?	I don't remember	Think.
What?...WHAT!?	I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
Sweetheart, you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.	Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.	We're not going anywhere, I promise.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?	I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.	You couldn't have made that jump.	I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.	How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.	He could have died.	But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
We should try fishing again.	You mean it?	I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.	I would completely support that.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.	How low?
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.	Who's that?
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.	Here!
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.	He's not a kill, he's still alive.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.	What about Eric and Dr. Grant?	Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.	What about Eric?
You had the phone the whole time?	Where is it?
PAUL!	DAD!
Where's Dad?	Just hold on.
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.	I know. I know. I want to look for him too.	then we should...
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.	He loves you too.	Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.	I didn't know, there were two islands.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?	Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.	About a thousand feet above it, actually.  Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.
They couldnt climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.	They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
I dont know.	I thought you were an expert.	Dr. Grant was.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?	Sure.
Eric!	It won't hold!
How was your trip? Profitable?	We'll be broke in four weeks.	Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
You rented an automated litter box.	It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.	Not if it can't dig.
Absolutely not.	They're here.	What?
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.	No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!	That does sound lucky.	It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.	Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.	The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.	Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
Is it a rex?	I don't think so.
How would you classify it?	Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.	They never got that big.	Baryonyx?	Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.	I don't remember that on InGen's list.	That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
It looks intact.	We should take it with us to signal any planes.
We could co-write a paper.	Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
ALAN!	KEEP GOING!
We need to keep moving.	Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...	Billy, I can't talk to you now.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.	Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
I CAN GET HIM!	NO!	I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
Hmm?	He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
He used to know me.	Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.	Really?  What do you do there?
Anything good?	Raptors, mostly.	My favorite.
You remember the sounds they made?	I try not to.	We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.	You think they could talk to each other?	To a degree we never imagined.
Good luck with the fund raising.	It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.	Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.	The last of my breed.
I'd better get going.	Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.	Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.	Goodbye, Alan.
When I met you, I thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.	A well-accepted theory.	Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
Eric, your parents are both here.	In Costa Rica?	On the island.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.	You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.	Which one do you prefer?	The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.	Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.	Any weapons, radios?
Found this, but the battery's dead.	It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.	The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
Did you read Malcolm's book?	Yeah.	What did you think?	I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
Know what this is?	A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.	Mine's new.
How much of this island have you explored?	I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.	We need to head for the coast.	Are you sure?	Why?	Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.	Then we go home?
Do you have any kids?	No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.	I want to be an astronaut.	See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.	But then you never get to go in space.	Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
Bonitas.	Something must've scared them.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?	She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
It's strikes me now I never told her that.	You should.	You're right.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?	No. I couldn't see.	Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute, would you?  They look worried.
We're safe!	No we're not.
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?	The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?	Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.	You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.	I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
Hmmm.	Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...	No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.	I'm flattered, but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego, you cant fly low enough to see anything of interest.
That's hard to believe.	Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case, the Costa Rican government.
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.	This plane can not land!
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?	Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...	Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.	I have never been on this island!	Sure you have. You wrote that book...
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.	Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.	You can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?	"There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The ""plus"" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that."
Well that's good.	But you never came across just one.
Amanda!	Back out! Move!
Billy!	It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.	Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.	Stan.
How did you know?	That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?	You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?	Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.	Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.	Just a little bit too much, I think.	How do you mean?	A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
Sorry.  We were saying?	You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?	Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
It matches the pictures.	It certainly does.
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?	If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
You hear something?	No.  I feel something.
Any damage?	Minimal.	"""Minimal"" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --"	Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.	You are an academic.	Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.	You think I'm all talk, Eddie?	It doesn't matter what I think.	Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
Is there an antidote?	Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!	Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
Resentful.	When you have a lot of time to think, it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.	It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.	They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.	You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.
What?	Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?	What are you talking about?	The hatchery, in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low, far less than one percent, that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation, not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.	I don't believe you.	Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.	No, no, no, no, no, no . . .	After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.	Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?	It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.	So what?
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team, phone numbers, contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see, so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts, as such money and equipment as you need, but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate, all will be lost.	John . . .	You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.
I'm not going, John.	Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
Oh --	-- my --
Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-	-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?	Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
But he's the head of InGen!	You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
Are you looking for a problem?	Everyone, keep your voices down!
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!	I want to see the nesting ground!
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!	Not without a shot of the nest.
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!	Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.	I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.	Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --	That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.	We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --
Hi, Dad.	Kelly!  What are you doing here?
Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.	I don't even know this woman.	Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.	Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?	I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.	My vacation is over in a week.	I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.	I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.	Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?	No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
Is that kid still bothering you?	Which one?	You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?	That was about a year ago.	Well, is he?	No.  Richard talked to his parents.	That Richard.
I could come with you.	Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.	I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.	This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.	You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?
How could you possibly?	Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
"""InGen.""  What's InGen?"	Where does it say that?	On the side of that one truck.
What are you guys gonna do?	Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?	I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!	I'm fine... I'm fine...
Dad!	Come on!
Cancel that, Dieter.	What?  Why?
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?	You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?	Okay.	Good lad.
Where do you think you're going?!	To collect my fee.
What kind of gun is that?	My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.	How close do you have to be?	Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.	Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
You rally think this'll draw the parent?	I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.	Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.	Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.	You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --
What?	I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.	You've broken its leg!	We've got to transport it seven thousand miles.  Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?
What in Christ's name is going on?!	Isn't it obvious?
What is?	The velociraptors.
What is that?	Piss.
Where's the power and radio setup?	Operations building.  Far end of the street.
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.	Good.
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?	Possible.
We took to the rock.	Why?
It's... behind... us.	It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.	Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?	Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.	You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.	You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.	If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--	I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.	You version of it.	There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.	We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.	It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--	InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
What's he got in there?	Piss.
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?	Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
Their what?	Oh, God.
What?	Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
You know how to work a radio, don't you?	You're going too?	I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11.
She's gutty.	She's nuts.
No way.	Oh, my God.
Do you see any family resemblance here?	You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
Then this is our chance.	Our chance to do what?	I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
There' no reason for name calling.	Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
?!	It has a broken leg!	So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!	No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
What do they want?!	What do you think they want?!
No.	No way.
Lava?	No.	What are they?	I don't know.
Come on!	Where's Kelly?	She's with Sarah!
We can't stay in here!	"We're sure as hell not going back out there"""	This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!	It'll hold!	For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at this!  You could-
Head for the roof!	I have to find Kelly!	I think she's with Sarah!	DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
Something's wrong.	Look!  Sarah!
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.	Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.	We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me, I have some experience in this matter.
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?	What's that?	A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.	Feeling a bit blue, are we?
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.	Why did you come here?	So that others would know about this place?	Why should they?	Because it exists.	It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?	Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.	So the truth is more important to you than your life?	I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.	But why?	"You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, ""why did you go up there to die?""  And he said ""I didn't.  I went up there to live."""	It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?	Four, counting the one in the chamber.	Don't let it out of your hands again.  Can the kid walk?
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?	Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.	That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!	What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.	Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.	I'm her father.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.	Funded by whom?	John Hammond.
Can you set up?	It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...	Think fast, Sarah.
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!	Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --	Are you insane?!	I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free --
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?	They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.	Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
Oh, God.	What?!	They're pushing us over the cliff.
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.	Maybe.  Maybe not.	Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.
Ian.  It's guano.	What?	These formations.  They're dried --	Birdshit?
So what's your story, Nick?	I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.	That must be interesting.  What drew you there?	Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.	Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.	You think this is all a joke?	Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?	Ian's a very good friend of mine.	He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.	I believe in him.
-- way we could safely --	Oh, no!
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.	Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!	Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
That little black line?	That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
Give it more morphine!	We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
Hold it down, Nick!	I'm trying!
"There's, uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One ""no"" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there, no question asked, nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:"	No.
WHAT ARE YOU-	JUMP!
Where's Kelly?	Where's Ian?
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.	None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.	Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
We have to send someone to look for him!	You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
Ask her.	Can the kid walk?
You've got to be kidding.	Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
Uh - - Mr. Hammond - -	Stop the program!  Stop the program!
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.	You're sure we have to?	It's not worth taking the chance, John.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.	Damn!
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.	Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.	So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.	It could have been worse, John.  It could have been a lot worse.
What?	The door security systems are shutting down.	Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?	What now?	Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!	Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!	The monitors are failing.
Phones are out too.	Where did the vehicles stop?
We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -	I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.	- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?	Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?	I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -	What one?
How many lines of code are there?	Uh - - about two million.	Two million - - great.  That would help.  Oh good, that'll take no time.
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -	Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
But would we get the phones back?	Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.	How would we cut off the lysine?	No trick to it.  Just stop running the program.  Leaving them unattended.
How long will this take?	'Bout thirty seconds.
You shouldn't use my name.	Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
Oh, I'll get 'em all.	Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.	How am I supposed to transport them?
What?  No menthol?	Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.	That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.	I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?	I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!	Shhhhh!
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?	The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?	Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.	Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.	Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.	Six weeks?
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.	These are dilated.  Take a look.	They are?  I'll be damned.	That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.	Are you sure?	Pretty sure.	There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.	You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them.
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.	I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
Did I say jerk?	I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
I have samples all over the kitchen.	Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
There you are.  Out you come.	Oh my God.	Could I have a tissue please?
Fascinating animals, fascinating.	Oh my God.	Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex.  Guarantee it.
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.	We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.	They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
Carousel.	"A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  ""I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?"" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade..."
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.	But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.	"You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around."	John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
Once we have control again we - -	Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.	John....
But you know, I should  really be the one going .	Why?	Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -	Look.
Mr. Arnold?  He's not answering me.  Okay I'm on the grating.	Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.	Okay, I'm following the tubing.  I'm going down a passage way.  How long does this stuff go for?  Could you guys talk a little bit to me?
Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -	They died together?	The taphonomy sure looks that way.	If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -	That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?	Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.	Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?	Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?	Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.	Cheap, cheap, cheap.	They smell.	Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.	They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.	Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.	They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.	The what?	The Cretaceous.	Anything else, you old fossil?	Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!	It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now!
Okay, who's the jerk?	Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....	Sattler.
And what are those?	Small versions of adults, honey.
Why would they care what we think?	What kind of park is it?
The movement!	The - - agility.  You're right!
Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.	They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -	Say again?
Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!	We were right!	How did you do it?!  How did you do this?!
So what are you thinking?	We're out of a job.
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?	Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
Oh, shit.	Dilophosaurus.
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.	It's my favorite.
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.	I know.
Constantly sick.	Not just every six weeks.	Yeah, I know.
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -	- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -	- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
- - like birds - -	- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -	- - a gizzard - -	- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -	- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -	- - barfs them up - -	- - and swallows fresh ones.	And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
Are you sure?	I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?	Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!	You can't hold it by yourself!	Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!	I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.	The fences are electrified, right?	That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
"Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens."	No, no, no!
Ellie, com one!!	The other car!
Dr. Grant!	Alan!
Do you see anything?	I don't know.
Alan?!	They're not here.
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!	What's that?
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.	You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
I'm going with you.	Okay.
Come on, let's go.	We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
Okay, I'm on channel two.	Stick to my heels.
Oh my God.  Aw, God.	The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
C'mon on, this way.	I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
No. We can't.	Why not?	Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
It's all right.	Like hell it is!
No.	No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
That's right.  Will break through.	I get ah - -	I know, it's very exciting.	And scary.	And scary.	When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -	It's anti-nature.	Anti-nature.
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.	Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.	I'm still not clear on Chaos.	It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.
Uh - - thumb!  The same way.	It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -	Alan, listen to this.	- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -	Oh, imperfections?	Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?	Unpredictability....	And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
Alan?	No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!	Alan?
Dino droppings?	Yeah.
Can we chance moving him?	Please - - chance it.
Faster, faster!	Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!	Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!	Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.	That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan.
Yes?	- - shut up.	Yes.  It's not a criticism, by the way.
Hola, Juanito	Hola, bienvenido
What's this I hear at the airport Hammond's not even here?	He sends his apologies.	You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?	He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.	I understand that.  I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now.  The insurance company - -
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.	Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.	Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.	Why not?	Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
I can't see.	What are we looking for?	Dilophosaurus.
Up and down, up and down!	I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.	People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
Hey!  Where did you find those things?	In a box under my seat.	Are they heavy?	Yeah.	Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?	And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.	Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.	Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?	No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
John, we - - what I'm just saying....	Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -	Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.	Sure, they will, they will.  We'll have a - - coupon day or something.
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -	That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.	I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?	Thank you.
Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.	Hey!  Where are the brakes?	Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
I read your book.	Oh, yeah - - great.
Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -	Listen, ahh - -	Tim.	Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -	Whichever one you are.
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.	Really?
These look kind of familiar.	Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?	Tim, are you okay?	I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!	Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
I threw up.	That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?	Yes it is.	It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?	No.	Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.	This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.	So am I going to help you with your foot?	What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.	That's a good idea.	You'll probably be safe enough  on your own --	I doubt it.	Maybe -- it's hard to say.
"It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means ""thunder lizard""."	"""Thunder lizard!"""
Straight-A brainiac!	Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
What do you call a blind dinosaur?	I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?	A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?	You got me.	A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.	It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.	It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.	This is a seventy-seven ton animal.  Come on over, Lex! Just think of it as a big cow.  Look at it's teeth?  Come here, girl.  This is a seventy-seven ton animal. Just think of it as a big cow!
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.	But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.	Amphibian DNA.
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?	Nope.
I can't!  I'm scared!	Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
Go, go, go, jump!	You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!	Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.	Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
So you two dig up dinosaurs?	Try to!
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!	Not without massive sequence gaps!
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.	You have no idea.	to Ellie) You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?
You got any kids?	Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
You're married?	Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
By the way, Dr. Sattler - she's not like, uh, available, is she? - -	Why?	Why?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you two, uh - - are?  I wish you the best luck.
What'd I touch?!	You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.	I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.	Machines hate you?	Yeah, they hate me.	You want to talk about this?	No.
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.	The kids okay?	Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?	Kids get scared.	What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.	I didn't say I was scared.	I didn't say you were scared.	I know.	Fine.
Where does he think he's going?	When you gotta go, you gotta go.
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!	You're sure?!	Relatively.
Oh my God!	We gotta do something.	What?  What can we do?	There's gotta be something - -
Hey, we were saving that!	For today, I guarantee it.	And who in God's name do you think you are....?	John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?	I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -	Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.	What kind of opinions?	Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.
Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau.	No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -	I could compensate you by fully funding your dig	- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -	For a further three years.
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?	The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.	We clocked the T-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
Can't you stop these things?!	Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!	Let's get outta here!
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.	Wu?
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.	Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -	Do they show intelligence?  With the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
Ah - - they're here.	Who?
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.	"What does he mean by ""target audience""?"
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.	After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
Tim!  Lex!	Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!	Let's get you out.
Dad - - Dad - -	Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?	He left us!  He left us!	That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!	I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
It's safe?	It's safe.	It's safe.	Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?	Alright.
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?	No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
Tim, Tim, Tim....	Oh, I hate the other kind.	They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.	Dorkatops!
What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more?	I guess we'll just have to evolve too.
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?	I'll stay awake.	All night?	All night.
Go away!	It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
I like cows.	You're a beautiful big animal.
What's that?	Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
Watch how it eats!	Please!	Bet you'll never look at birds the same way again!
Let's go!	Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!	Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!
Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!	Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.	Timmy!  Do as he says!  Timmy!  Do as Dr. Grant says, quick!
Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -	You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!	It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?	Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!	I'm coming up there Tim! I'm coming to get you!  Lex, I've got to get him!
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?	Yes.
What works?	Phone security systems, everything works.  You ask for it, we got it!
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!	Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!	Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!	I certainly have!  Very clearly!  Because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!	John, John.	Don't do that!	Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
Your silence intrigues me.	John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.	Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
You don't give us our due credit.  Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.	Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.  Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them.  Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!	But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!	Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.	I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?	There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?	"You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have ""thinktelligence.""  You think narrowly and call it ""being focused.""  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions."
That will teach you to trust Grandpa.	"Wait a minute?  What do you mean ""worked""?  Everything is still off!"
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.	I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.	You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.	I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.	I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....	I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.	Thanks, Dad.
Why didn't I build in Orlando?	I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.	Ray, start the tour program.
Sustain winds 45 knots.	Tell them when they get back to the cars.	Thanks, Steve.
Well?	There's no sign of him anywhere.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.	Sure.
We miss you.	Thanks for the presents.	We love the presents.
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!	Excellent.
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -	Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -	Why did you do this?	I don't know!  I'm sorry!
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?	What if we fall?  I hate trees.
I hate trees!	They don't bother me.	Yeah, you weren't in that last one.
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!	They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.	That means they only eat vegetables.  But for you, I think they'd make an exception.
I'm a hacker!	That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.	What?	Hey Lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.
That's not funny.	That was great!
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!	I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!	Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
Hello?	Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.	Really? How much?
Fifty.	Fifty? We need seventy-five.	Ken, we've been through this...
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.	Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...	Hey, smart-ass, I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat, with a two million dollar view of the lake.
Chain saws.	You want to put in chain saws?	No, no... listen, when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...	Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?	No, but...	And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?	That's not true...	We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.	Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...	I don't think you're getting in the spirit of things, Janet. We'll buy whatever studies we need --
Jesus Christ!	Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.	Get rid of them.
Okay... well... I think it's this way...	Great.
Mister Biller?	Yeah?	I think we're lost.	You have a map.	I know... but we left the main trail... and I can't find any landmarks around here... I've been trying to figure it out but...
I didn't think there were any houses up here...	You learn something new every day. Let's go.
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.	Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --	Help me with this.
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.	I really think we should go back...	I want to look at the rest of the house.
Hello?	Who is this? What's going on?	This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.	Where's Ken? Is he all right?
I don't know...	What about that other guy?	Other guy?	Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?	He... he's here...	Who's there?
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...	Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?	Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
Two.	I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.	I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.	That's my job.
Quite a circus.	And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
What?	You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?	I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
"I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	""Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."""	Fuck you.
What's going on?	Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
It's still on.	What?	His camera... it's still recording.
What happened?	_Krueger_...	Who?	Come on.
Three.  Where's my client?	Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.	What are the charges?	Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.	I thought that was Ted Bundy.	Compared to this guy... amateur.
A house?	That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --	He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...	Who's chest?	Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.	"Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?"	Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?
Are you going to plead insanity?	I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
Sorry.	It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.	Video store?
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?	Because everyone knows he's guilty...	Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_.
You think that's going to work?	I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore, we have to try everything.
You watch this garbage?	This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...
"""Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."""	A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
Well?	He's fucking nuts.	Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?	No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.	Doesnit sleep?	Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.	He wets the bed?	I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
Oh?	One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.	Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.	This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair.  If we're going to argue insanity, we're going to need something a little more concrete.
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.	This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?	No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.	Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.	So?	I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
"That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake"	None of that's true?	Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.	So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?	My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.	"I don't ""rationalize"" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all."	That didn't sound very convincing.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...	No. You've told me all I need to know.	Oh?	You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.	Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.	The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...	That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?	It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.	Insomnolesence...	It's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus. The part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive. They didn't know about it back in the sixties. Even now, it's not understood very well.
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?	Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...	If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...	Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.	How do we prove it?	Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.	Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.
How long will he need to be asleep?	We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?	There's a pizza place over on Market.	Cute waitresses?	That's open to debate.	I'll take my chances. Come on, I'm buying.
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.	He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.	Me too. I'm drunk.	Well, I'm onto something more useful.  You ever hear of a man named Fred Krueger?
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.	He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.	Fascinating.	Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.	That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.	Uh-huh...	Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.	Yeah... I think I understand...  You're drunk, too.
See this?	Yeah, what is it?	_It's a second REM pattern_.
It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.	That doesn't make sense.	Add it to the list.	So what do we do?
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...	Not yet.	Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.	"Great.	When can you do it?"	Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.	I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.	You're not going to be there?	I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.	It was Krueger, wasn't it?
You saw him?	A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...
What are you doing?	Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.	How's that possible?	Jason's asleep... maybe he's dreaming of himself as a young boy... and that boy is sitting right here.  I think he's some kind of projection from Jason's subconscious.
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.	Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.	Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
Where's he going?	I don't know... but I think he's pissed.	Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.	"Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere."
You know how to use one of those?	I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.	Think it'll do any good?
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.	And if he's not?	Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
What's that?	_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.	So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?	Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.	How long will the effect last?	About ten minutes.	Ten minutes...	If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
We're down to seven minutes.	Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
Are you all right?	For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
What happened? Where's Jason?	My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
-- I'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter.	Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
You work in the insurance department?	You have been hearing the sordid side then.
Where do you live?	Up there.
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.	What is it really?	A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.	Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
My assistants, I presume.	Yes -- that's us.
You look like brothers.	Yes -- we do.	Have you worked here long?	No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
Fine -- terrible.	What was the matter with it?
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?	You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.	You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
-- Merely in the interests of order.	The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?	-- Small.
Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.	Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.	I don't know what you could have read.	Just what you've published.	-- In magazines nobody reads.	I read the one about the penal colony.	Did you?	The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man.  Very good.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.	-- In what sense?
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?	Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.	Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.	I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.	Why do you work in that hideous insurance office?  -- dealing with people who fall off ladders.  Now take me -- I make my living as a stone mason.  It's not my art -- but it's the <u>tools</u> of my art.  You could be -- a journalist.
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.	Success or nothing?	No -- not even success.  My writing is not for making a living -- it's for living.  Not for other people, it's for me.
You work in the cemetery.	A man must eat --  And drink.	The <u>Castle</u> cemetery.
-- I'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details.  -- To see such determination is reward enough for me.	The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.	There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.	I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.	What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?	The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?	In a manner of speaking.
I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.	An empty tomb?	A cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere. But look --
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.	Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
-- You appreciate my writing.	Yes.	Will you do me a favor then?	Another one?	If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.	What an extraordinary request!	It's my last and final one.	Then its authority is in doubt.	A true friend would do it.	Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.	I gave it to him yesterday.	You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.	No, I left it in his office.	Did you see him?	I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.	He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.	He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?	Who's to say he ever will?  He's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes -- In fact, I'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me.
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.	Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --	But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.	Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.	When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.	I'll commit that to memory.
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?	Yes.
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?	Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.	Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.	Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.	It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.	You're just doing your job.	It's what I'm paid to do.	You're detestable.	And you're late!
You wanted to see me, sir.	Sit down, Kafka.
You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.	... My ... social situation?	You keep too much to yourself -- you're a lone wolf.  It makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy I can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees.
To do my work well, I have little time for --	You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?	I usually take lunch by the River.	It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.	I did not realize it was obligatory.	Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?	No, sir.	Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.	Well, I --	Oh, I know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name?	-- Eduard --	-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
I understand you fancy yourself an author.	In a small way.	You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.	I do.	I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.
Was there something else?	No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.	No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.	I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.	The <u>Orlac</u> claim.	Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --	I know.	You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.	Why would you suppose so?	Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --	One of you must be mistaken.
I'm sorry, but I just wondered --	Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
Hello again.	I've never seen you here before.	Have you looked?
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.	Yes.
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?	No.	He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.	I suspected that he -- well.	What?	That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.	It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
What's funny?	This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.	As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
How long were you and Eduard --	Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.	Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.	The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?	Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.	He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.	And you believe everything the authorities tell you.	When I have no reason to doubt.	The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.	-- What could he have done to warrant that?
Are you free tonight?	Tonight?	There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?	... All right.
You almost married recently, didn't you?	Last year.  I -- it was broken off.	Eduard wanted to marry me.	And you ...?	I'm suspicious of men who want to marry.  I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
-- I don't know the Musil district.	You won't have any trouble finding it.
"Ah -- we're back to the ""authorities"" you spoke of."	They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.	I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.	You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men.  And yet you're able to remain an outsider.  With the concomitant air of ... superiority?
The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?	What of it?	He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.	He was murdered.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.	I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.	When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.	People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?	My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?	"Yes -- which is why ""quiet, dependable people"" have to take charge of their own lives."	At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.	Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?	Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.	Why were you given notice?	They're not obliged to tell.	It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.	Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.	You don't believe that.	I wouldn't put it past him.
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.	Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.	It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.	Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.	Burgel doesn't like anybody!	He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.	He's jealous, yes, but <u>that</u> jealous?  He's too cautious.
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.	Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?	How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?	I've heard of it happening.	And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?	Usually.
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.	First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.	What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.	Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
Gabriela! -- you did get away.	I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.	-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.	Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
Gabriela ...?	Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.  It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.	I -- I found your jailer.	This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.	They're dead now.  We can get help.	I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.	There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.	I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.	I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.	Why should I believe a man who never believed me?  They're absolutely right, you know -- guilt should never be doubted. It's easier that way.
I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.	No -- not this time.	I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.	-- Listen to me --	I do.  Always.  You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka.  And what it's becoming.  I've always held you in the highest regard.
Kafka -- is that your real name?	Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?	When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?	Wednesday.  We left the office together.	Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?	No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.	Your office is the Workmen's --	-- Accident and Compensation Association.	Where you've been employed for seven years.	Eight -- and seven months.	Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.	Well -- other departments are, yes.	Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?	Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...	He was found in the River.  Could he swim?	I don't know.	Was he depressed?	No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?	Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?	No, I suppose not.	He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.	Can I ask -- how you found me?	His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.	I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.	We know that.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.	What makes you think so?	... Just a perception.
Probably not.	Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.	I'll bear that in mind.	-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all.	That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.	If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.	That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.	She's missing.  I went to her house and she hadn't returned there.
Maybe it's true then what she said.	What did she say?	That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
Do you?	We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
I didn't realize you'd been here that long.	You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!	You mean you've actually begun some?
What's the matter with you?	I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it	-- You should meet my father.
For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.	-- Just doing our job.	It's a farce.
Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.	Close only by virtue of antithesis.
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.	It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
... Why take me into your confidence?	That's obvious, isn't it?  We have an opening for a new member.
That's <u>mad</u>.	-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.	When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.	Then why haven't I been --
-- Gabriela, on the other hand, had made an enemy of this man Burgel.	Oh, Burgel!  Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard.  They were both members of <u>this group</u>.  If any crime's been discovered and people are paying for it, I'd look to <u>yourselves</u>!	The loyal civil servant.  I suppose you'll deny that shortchanging the workers to whom compensation is due is standard company policy.
... A piece of paper ...	A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.	... A piece of paper ...	You see, Kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at Orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority.
-- You seem amused.	It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.	"""Accident and Compensation"" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises."	I believe we've exceeded his expectations.	I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.	Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
May I ask where your two warders are?	Lying in the gutter where they belong.
The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.	On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.
-- And the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us.  Not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.	What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?	As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her.
"""Raban"" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet."	It usually is.	I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time.
"I'm overworked as it is.  ""Raban"" did you say?"	Yes.  Isn't it there?
"Wait a minute.  ""Raban?""  Where have I heard that name?"	He's the clerk who died last week. From the insurance department
What's the matter?	Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?	It's gone out so quickly?	Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.	-- You mean my Chief has it.
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?	Orlac is an account?	It's a factory in the northern mountains.  One of our best customers.  Without a proper request I'm not obliged to do this, you understand -- but I'll make an exception on this one occasion.
All these in the last year?	You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!	I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.	Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.	This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?	Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.	Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?	Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?	What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?	These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?	What if I petitioned one of the Directors?	You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.	Where do our records go to in the Castle?	We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.	I could always apply there.	It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
Ludwig.	Oskar.
He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.	You look tired.	Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you.  Do you know her?
Women are all you have on your mind!	She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing.
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.	We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.	It's not too bad working here.
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.	And we're upset too.
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.	-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.	My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
Oskar!	Ludwig?
This is filed incorrectly!	Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.	They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.	I understand he was wounded in the lung.	It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.	What's to become of us now?
Then that's the place for us!	Amerika for us!	Amerika!
Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.	Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!	You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!	There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!	"Does this look like the ""Queen Mary""?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!"
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...	Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.	It's ... lovely.	Miss Darrow ... I've been thinking. I would very much like to dedicate this motion picture to the memory of your father. It's a great shame he wasn't able to join us on this adventure. Truly a wonderful man.
"I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - ""The Lord Darrow Benefit screening"". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!"	To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!	Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
Get the hell out of here.''!	Now Ann ...
What have you got there?	A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?	I think you're trying to run before you can walk, Ann.
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...	I photographed it extensively, father.	Photography teaches you nothing, Ann! Click! One second and you've seen all you're going to see. I want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... I want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy. Understand the carving and you will understand the people! That Ann, is the key to archaeology.
Father!	These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -	Father ... Father!
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... · organize an expedition -	All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!	Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
He's grubbing for money, father.	I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?	No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!	You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!	Tell me, Mr Driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?
Holy God! The mummy walks!	How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!	Do they have him on display at the weekends?
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!	Value? ... Value?
I'm sorry ...	No!
Where do I charter a boat?	There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.	I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
Can you fly?	Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.	I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.	When this boat finally reaches Jakata, I'll be first off. You'll never see me again ... and believe me - that day cannot come soon enough. I've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage.
I want to thank you.	It's ok.I know what you were feeling.	I can't imagine you crying.	Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
There's a light up ahead.	Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
It's the same image - Kong!	Leave it, Ann.
Jack!	We're leaving.	But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.	Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
Oh Jesus ... you took it.	Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!	This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
Give it back!	I'm not sailing with this thing on board!	No! Don't!
Barricade the gates! Quick!	Jack!...  Jack!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?	Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!	He's gonna die! They'll kill him!	Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!	You're the animals - all of you!
Ann ... Ann!	It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.	"What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  ""Skull Island""  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!"	I tell you it doesn't exist!	We need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!	I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?	Two... maybe three.
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.	Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.	We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
Just take it easy .-- Where are the others?	They' re dead.	Oh my God ... Ann?
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?	We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!	"And I appreciate that so much, I really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across America when they view my latest documentary sensation ""Indonesia ...Hell Hole of the World"". Ernie Hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. We're going out through Universal ... Laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens."
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!	Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!	The mountains?
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?	Native costume?	Y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
We are a very modest and deeply religious people, Mr Denham.	That's too bad.
Man Eater!!!	A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
Did you see her?	Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.	What was it, Jack?	An ape ... some kind of ape.
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!	Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!	You better not slow us down, Denham!
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!	That's your monkey, Denham.	Kong ...
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!	) They are now.
They were just tasting the berries.	Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
Set up the camera boys! Get a shot of me comin' ashore!	Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.	What?	The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!	I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.	How about Ann? Is she going with you?
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.	"She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - ""Beauty and the Beast"".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there."
Are you nervous Jack?	Nab- Let's get it over with.
Did you fear for your life?	Yeah.
It must have been terrifying?	Yeah.
Are you gonna start it up?	Yeah.	Why?	Coz of something I lost.	What's that?	Compassion.	What's compassion, mister.
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.	Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.	Can't you see I'm strung out?  Please, we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it!
Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper --	Please, if he sees you, he won't come!	Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?	What about him? Yes.	Did he come around often?
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.	Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?	Uh uh.	Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --	Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
Why? She's a junkie.	She was with you after she left Frank.	Well she's not now.  I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could've had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink!
Enjoy.  Well --	It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?	Sure dear, yes.	Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.	Yes?	And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --	Mm.	And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
-- May I? It's so --	Please --
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.	Yes?	And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?	I'd just be guessing.	Guess!	Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --	I do not love him.	You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.	Don't belong?	Do you always have to repeat?	Sorry.	Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.	You think people hate you.	The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.	Didn't want you.	I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --	No.	Well I have to close up now.	Look -- could I use your phone?	Yes indeed.	Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.	Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.	Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?	A few more days. We know who did this.	So do I.	No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him -- also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.	Now there's a picture I'd like you to --	You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.	Well we're pretty --	Why isn't he locked up?	We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.	Is that why Klute didn't tell me?	I guess he figured it was better.	What was better? I made better bait?	No, that's not --	Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --	From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.	I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --	Here please.
Oh no.	Like for you to look for the man.	Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily?  I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? --	Yes -- all right --	-- We can talk --	-- Yes.	All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a -- position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book.
You have no idea what I'm talking about.	Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.	No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?	Yes.	Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.	Will you let me go then?
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?	If you'll let me go I could tell them what --	Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?	I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.	Excuse me Miss Daniel?	I said yes, I see.	Oh no, I don't think --	Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
What is it?	Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
What about?	My name's John Klute.	You said that.	I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
Who?	Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.	Gee.	He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.	Why?	You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.	Honest?	Will you let me ask you some questions?	Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?	Mm.	And you just want to ask me a few questions?	Mm.
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.	No, I'm look --	If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!	Could I ask some questions?	Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
Company outing or picnic or something like that.	Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --	-- Tuscarora --	All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
You remind me of my uncle.	What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?	Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --	But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.	I can't say he was anybody!
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--	What about everything since?
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --	Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --	What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --	Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?	Most of them.	Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --	How would I remember?	How else do you meet them? Pimps?	You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --	Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.	What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --	-- OK --	-- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.	OK.
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.	Tell me about Frank Ligourin.	Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
What? This?	-- OK?	I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.	No thanks.
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?	I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?	I go on rounds.	Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.	You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
Well do you think it was him?	What do you think?	Can't you get him?	Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.	You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.	Do you know where he got the dumper?	He never told me.	Well, let's go down and ask him.
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.	Is that what you gave him?
Did you like my friend Frankie?	No.	Didn't he tell you what you wanted?	It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --	About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?	It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.	Well -- she's dead.
I thought you were going back to the apartment.	You said you wanted these.
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?	You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.	Is there anything more I could --	I don't see anything, do you?	What're you gonna do next?	Try some other ways.	What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?	And I don't think that was Tom.	You said it was!	No, I said what did you think.	Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.	Well --	Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?	Yeah, you got to me.	-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?	Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?	Goodbye.
It's kind of late.	It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.	Not much point to this, is there?	Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?	Mm.	So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby --
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.	Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.	Thanks.	Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.	When?
I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.	Arlyn Page.	Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?	Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.	Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.	Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.	You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.	I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?	Don't worry.
What's the matter?	What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.	If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --	-- Then you don't need me.	But if it's someone else I do.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.	How?	The same as Jane McKenna.	Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.	Why?	Just let me know when you are going out and where --	What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.	How can you do it to yourself?	I don't get you.	Ligourin: How could you do it?	I told you before, you wouldn't understand.	You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.	No.	No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?	Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!	No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --	You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
Please.	We did this before.	No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.	I don't like getting splashed.
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?	My bed.
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.	Mm.	No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I --
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.	Yup.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?	Yeah.	Is that all you have to say?	What am I supposed to say?	Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
Spangler says we have a relationship.	What?	You and I -- a relationship.	I was wondering what that was.	Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.	Don't touch anything.
Oh look what he did in them.	Drop it.
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.	My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.	Bree --	Right back at the start, right?	Go down in my room.	You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?
Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?	Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.	Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints.  Can I go in? I need some stuff.
Where'd you spend last night?	With Trina.	I called Trina.	Maybe I wasn't there when you called.	Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.	How do you know how bad it was?	Why couldn't you stay here with me?	Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --	Trask wants to talk with you.
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.	Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.	Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.	Mm.	You're going back?	Mm.
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?	No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me.	You wanted to, or you are?	I am.	You could at least look at me!
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?	About what?	Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!	I don't think so.
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.	They don't scare me any more.	What?	Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.	OK.	You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?	Can you use these?
Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?	No. I'm sore.
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.	I believed her, Pete.
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?	It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.	Then, close the case.	I better keep looking.	Where, how?	I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.	You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.	It's got to make sense some way.
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.	How is it back there?	I think you're homesick.  I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.	Well there's a couple --	I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --	Well as a matter of --	I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.	Yeah.	I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?	Yeah, two things Pete, that --	You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?	Yeah. It wasn't Tom.	I'm sorry. I don't understand.	It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.	It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --	Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.	Some mistake perhaps that --	No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.	You must be discouraged.	Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.	That who?	Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.	You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.	Someone's been doing all these things.	You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.	Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.	What?	Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.	You were hired to look for Tom.	I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
I can't follow you.	Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?	No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.	It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.	Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.	All right, but I'm going to see that list.
I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?	Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.	Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.	Just send me a money order.	No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
Well --	Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
John, how are you?	I'll be sending you on a report tonight.	It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.	It's not so bad.
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.	What's in it?	I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.	No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --	Have you discussed this with them?	It's in the report.	Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?	I wanted to give it to you first.	All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?	All right.	Thank you. Goodbye, John.	Goodbye, Pete.
I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.	I've just got a few --	I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.	Two years ago? Sorry.	They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?	Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.	She told me.	OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.	Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?	You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.	I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.	Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?	I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.	Not unusual.	Did she talk about him to you?	About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.	Has she talked with you since prison?	No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.	I think she's trying that.	Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life.  But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -	Are you with plant security, Sergeant?	Town Police.	Then how are you involved?	I know Tom Grunemann.	You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?	We grew up together. Kids.	Can you account for his disappearance in any way?	No.	Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --	No.	Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?	Everybody's got some, I guess.	Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?	No.	Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question.
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?	Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.	What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.	He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.	Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.	I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.	I looked it up.
Well?	Yeah.
Think this is our guy?	I don't know. It looks familiar to me.	Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?	Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.	I knew Tom never wrote that letter.	What else do you know?	I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.	We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.	I don't believe Tom's alive.
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.	I left them here. I was doing some work here.
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.	Nobody's seen that.	If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
Are you closing the case?	No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?	Trask --
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.	Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.	Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --	Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --	Yes sir, we know he --	We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --	Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
Mr. Kramer?	Yes?	I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.	Oh, yes.  Won't you come in.
Where is the child?	He's in his room, playing.	Good.  I'll see him in there.
Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?	Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.	Does that distress you?	Not particularly.	What does?	The prospect of losing my child.	Very well, I'd like to see him if I may.
What do you have here, Billy?	Detroit.
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.	I see you have people there. What are their names?	That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.	What about your mommy?	Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.	Do you like to be with your mommy?
What do you like best about her?	Lunch in a restaurant.	What do you like best about your daddy?	Playing.	Tell me, does your daddy ever hit you?
He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.	In real life when does he hit you?	My daddy doesn't hit me, silly. Why would my daddy hit me?
Ladies and gentlemen...	Ladies and gentlemen...	Welcome to the greatest show on earth.	Welcome to the...
Greatest.	Greatest...	Show.	Show...
On earth.	On earth.
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?	The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?	Oh, Christ...Ah, yeah...you want to know why mom's not here, right?
When is mommy coming back?	Soon.  Very soon.
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?	Wow!  French toast, really?	Sure.  Didn't I ever tell you French toast was my specialty? I'll bet I never told you that. Now then, the first thing we need is...  ... eggs!  Right?
You forgot the milk.	That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
What about my orange juice?	Right.  One O.J. coming up.
When is mommy coming back?	Soon.  I told you before, very soon.	Will she pick me up after school?	No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.	What if she forgets?	I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
Uh, huh...	You got a letter from mom.
You're late.	I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--	Goodbye.
Okay...Same as usual...	Billy, don't eat with your fingers.	Sorry.
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.	Mom, I mean dad?	Yeah?	Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?	I guess...
Mom, I mean dad...	Uh huh...	That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.	C'mon, there's not much difference--	We use the green and yellow.
Mom, I mean dad...	In a minute...
You get a new fence.	C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...
I'm sorry.	Je-sus Christ!  I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and--	I'm sorry.	That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.	I'm sorry.
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?	That's okay.	It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...	That's okay...
Salisbury steak.	I hate it.	You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.	No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.	All it is is onions and gravy.	I'm allergic to onions.	You are not allergic of onions.
I want a pizza.	No.  This is fine.  Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
I think I'm going to throw up.	Oh, for God's sake...Here.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.	Some of the brown stuff is still there.	Then eat around it.	No.	Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?	I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.	Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!	No!
Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...	You're no bargain either, pal.	I want my mommy...I want my mommy..
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...	Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
Daddy?	Yeah?	I'm sorry...	That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.
Daddy?	Uh huh?	Are you...gonna go...away?
Is mom ever coming back?	You mean for good?
I don't think so.	Oh...
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.	Good night.	Sleep tight.	Don't let the bedbugs bite.	See you in the morning light.	Dad?
Yes?	I love you...
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...	It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...	See you in the morning light...
Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.	Sure.
Objection.  You're leading the witness.	Sure.
Objection.	Sure.  Lots of times.
See.  That's my name.	It's my name too.	Right.
Wow!	You like it?
Is this really your desk?	Yep.	Is that really your chair?	Uh huh...	Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?	Sure.
Did mommy ever see this?	No, she never did.	Are you going to get remarried?	I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.	Are you going to remarried Phyllis?	No.
No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.	Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
Mom--I mean, dad?	Uh, huh?	What did you do when you were little?	I guess about the same kind of things you do.	"Did you watch ""I Dream of Jeannie?"""	Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
Was there apple juice when you were little?	Yeah, there was apple juice.	Was there Burger King?	Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.	What else wasn't there?
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?	No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.	Why does he decide?	Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.	Like a principal?	Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.	I don't understand, daddy.	What don't you understand, pal?	Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?	At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.	Where will my toys be?	I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.	Who will read me my stories?	Your mom.	Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?	Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.	Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
Objection!	Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.	Sustained.
Objection!	Overruled.
Sustained.	Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?	Yes, your honor.	I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?	I do not, your honor, however--	This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.	Does the witness deny the injury took place?	No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.	Then I have concluded my questions.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?	Six years.	And would you describe those years as happy?	The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.	Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?	No, I did not.	Did you wish to?	Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.	Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?	Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.	And what is your present salary?	I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?	Yes.  Very much.	And yet you chose to leave him?
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.	Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?	Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.	Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
Objection.	How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
Objection!	Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?	Objection!
Objection!	Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.	Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
No further questions.  Thank you Mrs. Phillips.	No questions.
So do I.	Objection!
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.	Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
Objection!  Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.	While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?	Eight, almost nine years.	And did you have a close personal relationship?	Yes...	And how did you find his work?	It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.	And yet you fired him.
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.	Thank you.  I have no further questions.
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.	What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.	Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.	Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--	I understand and I'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up....  ...after the first of the year.
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--	Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.	Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--	Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.	My, we are a hot shot aren't we?
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?	Yes.	In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.	No.	Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?	No.	Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?	No.	A heavy drinker?	No.	Was he unfaithful?	No.	Did he ever fail to provide for you?	No.	Well, I can certainly understand why you left him.
I don't recall.	How many lovers have you had-- permanently?	I don't recall.	More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
Somewhere in between.	Do you have a lover now?
Is that...permanent?	I...I don't know...	"Then, we don't really know, do we, when you say ""permanently"" if you're planning to remain in New York, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent."
Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?	I suppose...	Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.	Yes.	How long was that?	We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.	So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.
I was not a failure.	Oh?  What do you call it then --a success?  The marriage ended in divorce.	I consider it less my failure than his.	Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
Were you?	Yes.
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.	Ted, I'm leaving you.	That represents a gross billing in excess of two million--  What?!
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--	Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...	I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.	Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.	Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.	Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--	I've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and the phone bill, so you don't have to worry about them.
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.	So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.	I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--	You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.	I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.	No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.	What about Billy?	I'm not taking him with me.	What?	Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...	C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--	I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.	Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.	NO!...Please...Please don't make me stay...I swear...If you do, sooner or later...maybe tomorrow, maybe next week...maybe a year from now...  I'll go right out the window.
Where are you going?	I don't know...
Hello, Ted.  You look well.	So do you.
How's the new job?	Fine.
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.	Yes...How's Billy?
I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault.  I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...	You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.
I've seen him.	You have?	A few times.  Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.
He looks like a terrific kid.	He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--	Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.	You've been living here, in the city?	Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.	You want what?!	I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.	Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?	Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--	Joanna, I don't give a--	Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.	Such as?
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.	Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--	Joanna, go fuck yourself!
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.	Yeah, well he did, didn't he.	Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--	I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--	Ted, do you love him?	Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--	Ted, do you love him?
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--	Joanna, what the hell is--	Please...Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..
"After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another ""should.""  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you..."	What?	He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...	Oh, God...Oh, my God...	Only can I still see him?	No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?	Beautiful.
Ted, will you take it easy? Revlon's not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this, without making us sweat.  Now just relax, okay? Everything's gonna be fine.	I don't think so, Jim.  Maybe I shouldn't have--
Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.	Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--	Listen, Ted...I just want to tell you, when old man Schmidt retires next year, I've got a pretty
Wow!	I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.	You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.
Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.	Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.	Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.	I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.	She'll be back...
But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?	I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.	Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.	I don't know, Jim...	Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--	Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
'Night, Jim.	Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
What the hell is this?	Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.	I don't.  Jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about.  It's not even close.
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?	Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.	Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--	That's my decision, Ted and that's final.
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--	Are you firing me, Jim?
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.	Sure.
Yes.	Yes, what?	Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.	Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
And?	He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.	Do you?
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?	Kramer...
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.	What?!?
You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.	I can't.  I've got Billy to take care of.	You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.	I don't believe you.
How should I know?	Murray.
So...what's so terrible about that?	Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.	No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...	Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--	I don't want to hear another word against him.  Not another word.  He's a wonderful man ...a wonderful man...
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?	Right.	But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.	Kramer--	Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.	Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.	Yeah?	I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
And?	I'm going to take it.
"It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ...""like"" you a lot.  And you...  ...""like"" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different..."	But it's not a year from now, is it?
What?	Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.	I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.	Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?	Three months.  How can you tell?	You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...
Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.	I know....I know.	Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.	No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.	Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.	Fine.
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.	First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.	Fine.	Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?	Six.
Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.	I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?	Do you want the kid or don't you?
Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.	When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
Oh, Christ!	The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.	I lost him?  I lost him?	I can't tell you how sorry I am.	Oh, no..	Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January.  That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month.  That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period.  That's it.	What if I fight it?	We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.	I'll take my chances.	It's going to cost.	Don't worry.  I'll get the money.
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?	Six years.  Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.	How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?	Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.	Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?	It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.	Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
John?	Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.	Ted?  Are you there?	Yeah.	Any prospects?	Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.	How the hell are you going to do that?	I don't know.
What?!  She wants what?!	She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.	John, what if she kidnaps him.
You ever see her talk to the walls?	No, but--	Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer.  One inch over and it would have caught the eye.	But I'm going to have to take some stitches.	How many?	Ten.
Now, I'd advise you to wait outside.  It'll be eas--	No.	Mr. Kramer, there's--	Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.	Look, Ted, all I--	I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.	Ted, all I wanted to know was where--	"I walk in the house and before I can say ""How are you?"", ""Did you have a nice day?"" before I can say anything.   Pow she's out the door."	OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.	Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.	Ted, don't be so hostile.
Hostile?  Me?  Thelma, I'm not hostile.  I am anything but hostile.  But if you want to know what I am.  I'll tell you what I am. What I am is, I am hurt.  I am very hurt.  And I just want to know one thing, okay?  Just one thing ...Why?  That's all I want to know...Why?	Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.	Things? What kind of things?	I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--	Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--	What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.	Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with?!  Did it?!  For one thing she's always thirty minutes late.  You can set your watch by it--
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--	Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.	Joanna said that?
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?	Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.	Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?	No.
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.	Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.	I'd like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child?
What are you going to do?	I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.	I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?	I'm gonna keep him, why?	Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.	Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.	All right...Okay...But let's get something straight, right now. I mean, I'm sorry about what happened between you and Joanna, but it's not my problem, understand?
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?	Got it.	You're on your own, understand?	I understand.	You're sure?	I'm sure.
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!	Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.	Slow down...Slow down...
You ever think about getting married again?	"No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about ""Till death do you part?""  That's really true."	How many onions does it say to use?	Three.  And add some basil.	D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?	No.  I don't think so.	C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.	Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?	Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.	California?	Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
She ever ask about me?	Uh, huh...Yeah...	What d'you tell her?	I told her you're doing a
He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?	Sure.	I don't mean a little favor. mean a big F favor.
Thelma, if I die--	What?	I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--	Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!	Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?	Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?!	I thought about it a lot and you're the only person I know that I trust with him.  I mean, if anything happened to me, he'd be okay with you.  You're a good mother.
You heard anything yet?	Any day.
Ted.	Uh, huh...	Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.	You and Charley?
Hey, that's terrific.	Maybe.  I said maybe.  What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...	Ted, I just heard...	Please, Thel...
Huh.. .Hello?	All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.	Ted, what are you talking about?!	Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.	Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?	Ha!  You tell me.
We must go, Holiness.	A moment.
Please, come, Holiness.	Yes. I am ready.
All quiet?	Yes, Holiness.	Where are you from?	Kham, Holiness.	Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.	Khambas are wild men.
I worry about them.	Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
Mama, my story.	Again?	Tell me.
Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.	Cow.
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.	No cried?
"And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. ""The Protector."""	I know.
I am sorry, Lhamo.	It is alright, Father.
Not the way to talk to people.	Can I do anything I want?	No.	But, I am in charge.	Are you? Of whom?
I do, now.	And you have horses? You love horses.	I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.	Will you buy the sheep for me?	Where will you keep them?	Here. We'll collect them.	I will buy them for you.	Can I free the prisoners?	Hmmm.
Goodbye, Kundun.	No!
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.	You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.	We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.	Are you, General?	We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.	Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.	The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.	So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re-evaluate your needs.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?	It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?	To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.	Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.	I will not approve it.	Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.	And we will begin with tearing it down.
Dalai Lama.	General Chiang.	We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.	Thank you. Please sit.
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?	I have.	I have a copy for you.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?	Soon.	Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.
He has been imprisoned, here in the Potala, Holiness.	The Sera monks have surrendered?	It is calm.
Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.	"The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the ""Chinese region of Tibet"". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it."	Did you receive the letter?	We did not.
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.	All?
And the United Nations? Surely?	The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.	Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.	With much bloodshed.	I am afraid.	I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?	Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.	He is a capable man.
Yes.	Time to study.
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.	Yes, but they say he did.
Holiness?	Yes.	General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.	Then, we shall meet.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.	If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
Oh, no. Where will he go?	Far, far away.
Your father had been very sick.	He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.	Cow.	"Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, ""His time has come."""	Me. First break of day.	At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.	I pooped.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.	I miss my brother.	I miss him too.
I will be back in a few days.	How many?	Two.
This many?	Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
Who am I?	We do not know.
The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.	I accept it. What is suffering?	True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.	I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?	The causes of suffering arise from true sources. Attachment, desire, envy, hatred, greed, unkindness, wrong view and so forth -- these are some causes of suffering.
I need to squeeze this brain.	Answer.
Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.	You could buy them.	Do I have money?	What do you think?	Do you have money?
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.	I am him.	Not until you are eighteen.
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?	Please.
How big is Tibet's army?	Roughly five thousand men.	Is that big?	No. Not very big.	The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too.
Will we be in this war?	No. This war is almost over.	Will we ever be in war?
In the Pacific Ocean.	It is an island. American territory.	Where is Alsace?	I do not know, Holiness.
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?	He warned about the future of Tibet.	Tell me.	When it is time.
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.	Look here!
What can I do? I am only a boy.	You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.	Ask whatever you will.	What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.	So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.	Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.	Can India help us?	India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.	Britain?	Britain chooses not to.	And, America?	America, we shall see.	Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
Quite simple. Yes. Good.	I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
What is the size of our army, now?	Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
Has anyone died?	"The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, ""The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming."" And then, the radio went dead."
"One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called ""El Salvador""."	Where is that?	In the Americas.
Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.	And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking. Agreed. Send Ngabo. Is that all?
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.	At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.	The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.	Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
I am scared.	Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?	My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change.
Did you ever doubt it?	I had relinquished doubt.
I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.	The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.	A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.	The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.	Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
They will take Lhasa next.	The people will not allow it.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.	I will not go.	I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.	Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
Good day.	Good day.	Please, come in, so cold.	We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?	Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.	Thank you.
You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.	I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.	It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.	Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.	For me, I think such a mix is crucial.	Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.	I leave tomorrow.	Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.	You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.	Always.
I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.	"Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is ""lavish"" and ""willful"". ""How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"""	Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.	He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.	But you will always be here?	Me?	You will always!	I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming.
Do you think I must?	You decide.
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.	Does he have the spot?	He does, a little spot where the butter had been.	Is that a true story, or pretend?	What do you think?	True.	You decide.
What does the butter spot feel like?	Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.	And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.	I am braver.
I have more men.	I have smarter men.
Things change, Kundun.	Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.	Is that true or pretend?	It is a story, you decide.	Pretend.	As you say.
I want to go down there.	You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.	I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.	You cannot.	I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.	But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.	Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.	I would not know. Maybe.
We have enemies.	The Chinese.	Yes.	But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
This is Britain.	Ahh.	Where is Poland?
This is Tibet. And this is China.	Ahh.
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!	Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.
The people want you made Dalai Lama.	Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.	These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.	But, I have no experience.	Oh, but you do, Kundun. Who else would be here?
You will not come?	No, Holiness.	Am I running away?	The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
You must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.	I will miss you.	We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.	We have.	You have grown up very good.	And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
Tell me.	They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.	You, kill me?	Eliminate you.
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.	Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?	I do.	I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.	The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.	We cannot.	This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.	Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.	These are not human beings. They are worse than ghosts.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.	How could I ever leave?	It may not be your decision to make.
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.	It is possible, Holiness.	You are unharmed?	Completely.	Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.	What would you do, Holiness?
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?	It is a difficult situation.	I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?	Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
Did you love your husband, before you married?	I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.	Hmm.	The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.	Does he treat you fairly?
No.	Too young?	Much too young.	Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.	Like my mother.	I see that.
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?	Oh yes.  I killed him.
You killed him.	Oh, yes.
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?	No.  Do you?
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.	We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.	You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.	My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.	Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?	Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
I haven't broken any laws.	Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.	The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?	<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--	Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...	You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.	Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.
I'll sue you.	Go ahead.
You're a beautiful woman.	Thank you.	And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
It seems like we're getting lower.	It happens when I land.	Why are we landing?	'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.	<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--	I need to see his habitat.
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.	He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
I might get a shot.	<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.	Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.
Go!!!	<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?	I'll need any and all topographic studies.	Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.	I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--	Mr. Cyr!	C'mon, we're losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?	They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.	And what would he do come winter?	They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
Around here.  Yeah.	If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
We'd only just met.	Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.	Keystone what?	Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
We are here on official business.	Cocktail?	<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?	They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.	Everybody out, back to your tents, <u>now</u>!
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.	No!!  Out!
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--	And you like me.	I do <u>not</u> like you.	Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
Jesus Christ!!	What the hell are you doing?!!	What are <u>you</u> doing?!	You're crawling around like a--	I'm laying a spring trap!	A spring trap!	I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--	I coulda shot you, you--	This could end up saving your life,--
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.	They don't really attack underwater and--	"That ""Walt"" guy got hit underwater--"	No crocodile has ever--
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?	Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
Is this a trick?	What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.	No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Was he a good man?	Yup.	Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
His head was just... bitten off.	I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
This is a setback.	You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
Promise you won't kill me, first.	I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
Asia?  How... how could he get here?	Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.	Is everything a big fucking joke to you?	<u>Bite</u> <u>my</u> <u>bishop</u>.
What's that?	It came from across the lake.
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?	He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.	Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--	I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.	That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?	Raincheck.
I can arrest you!!	Then do it!!	You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.	So profound and fat.
Gee, that would really disappoint me.	Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
No!	I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.	I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
Where is he?!	I don't know!
"At school they'd always say ""go"" first."	Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.	"He never said ""go""."	Get the gun.
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.	Bastard bit my chopper.	Hey!!
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--	'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--	I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--	<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.	Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
No way.	Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--	We both know what they'll do.
And again.  How would you get him on land?	That's actually the easy part.
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.	Right.	The more he thrashes, the better.	You ready on shore?	We're ready.
I got something on the screen.	You do?
Where?  Where?	Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.	Can you confirm visually or just radar?	Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.	Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.	Thank you, Jack.	"You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling ""go"" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land.  You set?"
Where is he?	Tranq guns down, rifles up!
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.	Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
You take care.	You talk to Bickerman?	She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.	Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?	Just those two.
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.	That hurt my feelings.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?	I never had sex with you!	Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.	'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.	<u>Hector</u>.
None of us actually <u>saw</u> anything.  I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.	What's going on?
Such the flirt.	U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.	And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?	I'm just saying last resort.
Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.	What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.	As if.  Will you miss me?
He was an Indo-pacific.	Are you sure?	Scales were oval.  It was an <u>Asian</u> crocodile.
<u>Jack</u>!	I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?	You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?	Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.	Nothing's real.	Excuse me?	<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
With crocodiles... everything's even.	I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--	I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--	Oh, bullshit.
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?	No.	Eh.  Fuck it.	Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?	Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...
What?	Could we have intercourse?
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.	They could try to tranq him on land.	They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
And how would we neutralize him?	We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
I'm okay.	You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
You're gonna be okay.	Guess I finally got bit.	Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.
He's gonna live?	Yeah.  Thanks to you.	And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
Kelly Scott.	Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?	Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
Did you make anything of the tooth?	Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.	Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
How big do the bears get?	Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...	And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?	Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
It really is beautiful, isn't it?	Never been to Maine before?	I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never <u>believed</u> it.
Why are you here?  Really.	I <u>told</u> you.	The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--	How would <u>you</u> know, what--	And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.	So I don't like tents, why--	You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--
I'm not making it up.	Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--	I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
Oh my God.	What?	If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.	Who?	Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
In Maine?	There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
Same thing from Fish And Game.	<u>Something's</u> in that water.	Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.
Baby crocs?	Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...	If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?	Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.	I'd be able to see something.
What are you doing?	Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.	I beg your pardon?	Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--	I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.	It's too dangerous for--	I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--	You flew up here because your boss--	I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
That was an awful thing to say to me.	I'm sorry but you're...
Okay.  We're up at six.	Good.	'Night.
He thinks they're what?	In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.	Good.  See ya soon.	Good luck.
You okay?  Kelly?	Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?	No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.	That's probably good.	Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  They just want us to sit tight.
<u>Are</u> you okay?	Um... y'know...  Yeah.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.	I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.	Excuse me?	When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.	What are you talking about?	I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.	Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.	Forgive me for trying to be nice.	"Nice?  Nice would be ""you look pretty,"" nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good."	I didn't say it like that.	You <u>did</u>, you--	I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.	A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.	Just forget it.
Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.	But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
Like little children.  You okay?	Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.	I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?	I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.	Let's get away from the shore.
Sorry.	It's okay.
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.	Just gotta pull it a little tighter.	Who taught you be be a nurse?	Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.	No thanks.	Keep it dry.  No swimming.	Thank you.
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?	What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?	Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
Thanks for the... bandaid.	Night.
Well.  Goodnight.	We seem to say goodnight a lot.	We could <u>not</u> say it and...  Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.	Ssssh!	What?	I heard something.
Thing we can lift it?	Maybe.  Don't mush it.	I'm not mushing it.	You're mushing it a little around the--	<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.	<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!	Really--	<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!	Calm down.	You calm down!	<u>Calm</u> <u>down</u>.
What?	Look.
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?	Alright, Jack!	<u>No</u>!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.	Okay.	We might as well pack.	Good idea.
Are we crazy?	Well...	We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
It can't work.	He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.	He looks like a giant tea bag.
He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?	He's floating.  Take it home.	Hector.
He's mooing.	You wouldn't?
Watch out!!	Keep firing!
Hector!!	Take him.
We gotta get to Hector!!	Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
He's through fighting.  Look at him.	I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
Get him onto shore.	He heeds a tourniquet.
Well...	You wanna ride in my truck?
You sure?  I don't mind...	No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
If I'm ever in New York...	Yeah.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and...	But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
It was... something meeting you.	Likewise.
Different worlds, Jack.	Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?	No.	So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.	You think?	Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?	Probably not.
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.	Good thinking.
We set?	Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
I'm ready when you are.	Let's go.
Half mile up, there's a clearing.	You gonna dig up that lady's husband?	I'll call the coroner.
What's that?	White perch.	Are they feeding?	Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.	They look like they're jumping.
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.	Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
You said nobody came in here!	Obviously I was wrong!
Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.	We shouldn't even really be doing this.	They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.	So does he.
Now I'm gonna puke.	<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.	Other than to eat us?
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!	Where is he?!
If you get a safe shot...	I'll take it!	Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
He's done.  He's dying.	Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
Thanks for your help.	You too.
He just came up screaming.	Did he say anything?	He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.	And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?	The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.	<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.	Yes.	Is the dead guy in there?	That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?	Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
I wouldn't.	I'm fine, thank you.	Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?	Well.  At wakes.	This is a little different.	I can look at dead things.
This... how long did this attack go on for?	Seconds.  Three, four.	And this is how he came to the boat?	Yes.	Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.	You talk to the married couple?	Not yet.	What kind of backup do we have?	<u>We</u>?
What?	Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.	You have a thing against museums?	I got nothing against--	Ever even been <u>in</u> one?
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?	Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.	And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?
You're sort of a rude person.	It's just that--
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?	Was he swallowed?	Sheriff.
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.	They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.	Gee.
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.	We're staying in <u>tents</u>?	I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.	"Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard ""tents"", will there be toilets?"	What the hell?
What?	I thought I saw...	It looks like a branch.
Hey!!	You threw it at me!!	I just let go of it.
With what?	Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
They don't believe her.	Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker.
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.	<u>Apologize</u>?
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?	It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.	Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.	I'm sorry.
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?	I asked you to be nice to him.
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.	And that's why he thinks they're Godly?	He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.	You like Jack?	<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.	Hector thinks you like him.	Well Hector's a giant cracker.	You think Jack's handsome?	What is this?	I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?	Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.	<u>That</u> was a bust.
What was that?	I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
Are you alright?	I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
Hank?	Yes.
Are you okay?	Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine.  Could you cut me down?
Hank!	He said he knew Karate!
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.	Look.
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.	What?	Look ten feet into the water.
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.	She's worried about the cow now.
They're coming right in.	Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?	That it's about to go wrong.
Did you get him?	I don't know.  Back the truck--
Should I?	Wait.
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?	I guess.
Kelly.	Kevin, hey.
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?	Absolutely.
I had a great time last night. Again.	Me too.
That's not what you came to say.	"You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, ""us""..."
"I was working for you when ""us"" started, what's--"	I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.	Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?	The somebody else part?	Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...	Else.
Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...	A jerk.	<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...	It's ten after nine.	Yes, well...  famished.
Hey.	Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.	This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.	A tooth?	A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.	Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?	I want you to go there.
Sorry?	I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--	This is what we do?	I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--	Are you on drugs?	Kelly--	I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--	Part of our research--	I'm not even a field person.	Well on this one I'd like you to be.
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--	It has nothing to do with--	I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--	<u>Kelly</u>--	<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?	I <u>tapped</u> you.	Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.	Wild guess.	I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.	Kevin told me you were upset.	Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?	Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
<u>You</u>?	It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--	<u>You</u>?	It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...	You and Kevin.	It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.	Kelly--	I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...	Backstabber?	No.	Liar?	Myra.	Shitbutt?	I really... I should get back.
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?	Never cock. Just squeeze.	I love it when you talk dirty.
What'd I do?	"Stay cool. Just remember to call him ""God."""
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.	Thanks, Ardelia.
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?	Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
Boy, is that smart...	Why does she keep repeating the name?	Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.
No. He won't come after me.	Why not?	It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.	The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...	Lecter said a lot of things.	He's here, Ardelia.
"""Desperately random."" What does he mean?"	Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?	But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.	Well, except for the one girl.	What girl?	The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?	'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.	But why? He didn't weight the others.
"""- every day."""	Hot damn, Clarice.	He knew her...!
Agent Starling! Telephone!	Agent Mapp! Thank you!
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.	Where?	Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?	I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...	Sometimes.	He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never.
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.	I will... I promise.	Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too. If you ever need to, you can shoot.
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.	Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!	You're all right! Where is he?	Get me out!	I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?	I don't know! Get me out!!	Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -	NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU	Shut UP!  The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.	I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.	How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?	"A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his ""taste"" - so to speak."	I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.	Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?	I understand.	I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG. When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her...
Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?	You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.	But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!	Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.	He's my patient! I have rights!  I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.	Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -	Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.	I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.	Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -	Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.	"Sir, doesn't this ""William Rubin"" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?"
Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?	Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -	Starling -	But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!	The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...	I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?	Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.	Good idea.
Okay, Miss Starling?	Okay, Mr. Yow...
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?	That wasn't me.	Oh.
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.	Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.	Not yet! - just wait for me.  Maybe in about two seconds.
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?	Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?	Jack Gordon.	Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?	No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?	Thanks.
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?	I think we may be, yes.
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?	Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.	Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.	Good morning, Mr. Crawford.	Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.	I hope so. They haven't posted anything.	A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling.
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?	Not yet.	You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.	Who's the subject?	The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?	You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?	Yes sir.	Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.	And what is that, sir?
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?	It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.	Every word, Starling? Every gesture?	Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?	"He mentioned a name, at the very end. ""Mofet..."" Any followup on her?"	"I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But ""Split City"" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice."
Well? Why aren't you there right now?	Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -	Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?	To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -	Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.	Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.	Miggs has been murdered.	Murdered...? How?	The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?	I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.	You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello...  I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on.
Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.	There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?	Good idea, but he thought of it, too. We've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. You put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out. No, this one is different. This one has seen us coming...
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.	He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.	Why?	What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.	Why not?	He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.	Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.	"Like I have a ""knack"" for Dr. Lecter?"
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.	You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.	What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.	You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.	Are you finished?	He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
What do you see, Starling?	Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...	They weren't there. Get close-ups.
When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.	It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.	Point taken.
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.	I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?	The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -	Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.	You seem pretty sure of that.	Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.	He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?	He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.	But if he knew we have so little time -	If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.	I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.	What would it take?	Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?	State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?	You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?	She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.	Let's get some coffee and talk.
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?	I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.	If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home.
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.	Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?	Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours.	Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?	They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.	You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.	You do until six p.m.
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.	But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!	I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.	But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.	With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.	He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it...
"He's making himself a ""woman suit,"" Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -"	Starling -	That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -	Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.	Where?
Sir, that's great news. But how -	"Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is ""Jamie Gumb,"" AKA ""John Grant."" Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name."
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...	Sewing...	"Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was ""John Grant."" Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other."	Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -	No, Starling, there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder, not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl, before he's indicted.
Yes sir... I'll do my best.	Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.	Yes sir. Thank you, sir...
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?	I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.	Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?	Not lately. But maybe someday.
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?	They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.	Dr. Lecter...
They said she was just rags, like somebody -	Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?	No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.	Did you ever work with her?	Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.	Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.	She died. She went to Florida to retire, like two years ago? She dies own there.
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?	I think so.	You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?	Sometimes you do.	Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job. This - toaster giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit. What did she know, big dummy...
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.	"""We"" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect."	I am, yes.	May I see your credentials?
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?	I'm - still in training at the Academy.	Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?	We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?	Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.
"Now then. What did Miggs say to you?  ""Multiple Miggs,"" in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?"	"He said - ""I can smell your cunt."""	I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?	Yes.	It's much better than your shoes.	Maybe they'll catch up.	I have no doubt of it.	Did you do those drawings, Doctor?	Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?	All that detail, just from memory...?	Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.
Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -	No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.	I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.	Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?	No, I came because we need -	How many women has he used, our Bill?	Five... so far.	All flayed...?	Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -	Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.	I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.	Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.	It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.	I didn't.	No. You ate yours.
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?	No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.	You're a tough one, aren't you?	Reasonably so. Yes.	And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.	And the questionnaire...?	A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.	Then please - do this test for me.	No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.	What's that, Dr. Lecter?	Advancement, of course.  Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... Now go. Go.  I don't think Miggs could manage again so soon, even if he is crazy - do you?
Your bleeding has stopped.	How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.	Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?	Why? Do you know something about him?	I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.	"Why don't you tell me about ""Miss Mofet?"" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?"	"His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under ""Missing Person"" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true."	If you didn't kill him, then who did?	Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.	Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?	And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?	Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.	Ahhh... Why?	Because you weren't wasting my time.	Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?	I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.	Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.	I never thought about it.	Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?	That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.	Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?	I don't know. Is it?	Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.	Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?	I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.	Who killed your patient?	Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.	Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.	"That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his ""next-to-latest""?"	By the book, he's a sadist.	Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?	Yes.	Big through the hips. Roomy.	They all were.	Mmm. And what else...?	She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.	Was it a butterfly?	A moth... How did you predict that?	I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
"""Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center."" Sounds charming."	That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.	"Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it will be ""turns"" with us, too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things. Not about this case, though - about yourself. Yes or no?  Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock..."
Go, Doctor.	What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.	The death of my father.	Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.	Killed outright?	No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.	You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.	Quid pro quo, Doctor.	The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...	Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.	Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?	No. Tell me why.	After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.	I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.	A cattle ranch?	Horses - and sheep...	How long did you live there?	Two months.	Why so briefly?	I - ran away...	Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?	No.	Did he try to?	No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.	Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.	You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.	There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.	On what basis would they reject him?	The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.	How would he test?
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?	Yes, Doctor. Please.
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.	How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?	Nobody sent me. I came on my own.
"Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this ""William Rubin"", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?"	Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.	I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.	I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.	Then tell me how.	First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek?	He kills w-	No! That's incidental.
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?	Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-	No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.	No. We just -	No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?	All right, then tell me how -	No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?	Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -	We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.	Later, listen, I'll -	I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?	And - one morning I just - ran away...
"Not ""just,"" Clarice. What set you off? You started what time?"	Early. Still dark.	Then something woke you. What? Did you dream...? What was it?
I heard a strange sound...	What was it?
What did you do?	Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?	Yes...! They were screaming.	So you ran away...	No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...	But you could. You did.	I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could...
Where were you going?	I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...	But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?	Yes...	Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?	Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.	Thank you, Clarice.	Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.	Dr. Chilton... I believe you know each other?
Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?	Yes. I'll tell you.	Promise...?  Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
Starling.	Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.	Dr. Lecter -	I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.	You know I can't make that promise.	Goodbye, Clarice...  You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit.
I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.	Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.	You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.	That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.	I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose?	Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.	It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.	Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind.
I won't waste your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. Clarice Starling and that awful Jack Crawford have wasted far too much already. I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... Let me help you now, and I'll trust you when it's all over.	You have my word. Paul?
What...?	Did you breast-feed her?
Yes... I did.	Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.	Let's go with it.
"Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The ""collar,"" I think they say."	Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.	Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
Time, Pilch! My move.	No fair! You lured him with produce.
Of course it counts. How do you play?	Officer Starling. Welcome back.
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.	I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?	Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...	The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
My God, you've grown up.	We leave in the morning?!	Yes, miss.	I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
Are you alright?	Can we rest soon?	Absolutely.
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...	Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!	Let us go, miss.	I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.
Why didn't you bury those people?	Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...	You knew them.
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.	Well that is to be expected. My father...	"Your ""father""?"	Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.	He did?	"Yes. He said... ""do not try to make them understand you."""	What?!	"Yes. And ""do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."""
The Ottawa are gone.	Why did they turn back?
"""We're a breed apart and we make no sense""...?"	In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...	Thank you so much.
They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.	I'm sorry.	I do not remember them. I was one or two.	How did you learn English?	My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.	And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?	The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.	In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?	'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave...  Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...	Sorry to disappoint you...	On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring...  to my blood...  ...than any imagining could possibly have been...
Much further?	Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
Mr Poe?	Miss.  May I?
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?	Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?	Because what I am interested in is right here...	What would you have me do?
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.	No. I will find you.	Do not.  Promise me.
What is it?	I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
Are we safe?	Maybe...	Our father? Did you see my father?
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?	Yes. I want you to go.
Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...	...never doubt what you are doing.
And my compliments to you...	Alice?
Will you go back to England?	I have nothing to go back for.
Where will we go?	Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?	When? How?	My letter...	There was none!	What?	There was no letter.	I sent three men to Webb!
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.	He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.	"""Justice""?  If that's ""justice""..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people."	You do not know what you are saying!	Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...	And by sea!	You still have an aversion to the water?	"Aversion?  No... ""Hatred""... ""Loathing""..."
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?	Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?	Some say that's the way of it.	"""Some""?"	Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...	Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
Will you consider that?	Yes. Yes, I will.
My God, Alice.	It can be dangerous...
One called Magua arrived.	He delivered no such message.
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...	Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
I see...	I am sorry, Duncan...
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.	Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.	You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
"They do not live their lives ""by your leave.""  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way."	You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
Yes. Go ahead.	What the bloody hell plan is this?
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.	What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.	We were headed...	...Fort William Henry.
How far is it, scout?	Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?	Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.	He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?	What?!	Dark haired...	Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.	No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?	Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?	Came across the war party, tracked 'em.	Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?	No.	Fort Edward, then?	No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.	I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
"I ain't your ""scout"". And I am in no damn militia."	Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?	England does not protect me and does not war against France on our account. She uses us to war against France on her own account...  of greed for land and furs.
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!	Do not let gratitude get in the way...
Who were these people?	Ottawa!	Excuse me...
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!	That is sedition! Treason!	That is the truth!	I ought to have you whipped from this fort!	Major!  Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.
How long?	Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
Head for... for the white water.	Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall... into British hands...  What white water?
Where do we go from here?	We don't.	I don't understand!	This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.	Then what?	Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.	And if we're unlucky?	You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
Any powder?	: Only one or two loads.
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.	Your enemy...
What did you say?	I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.	Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?	First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...	Will you men help us stop the French?	... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.	You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?	...No...Do not call myself much of a subject at all.
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.	Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?	A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.	Folks here goin' to join in that fight?	We'll see in the morning...
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.	Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers...
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.	You're not coming with us?
Got a reason to stay.	That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?	It does and it is a better lookin' reason than you, Jack Winthrop.  Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French outpost by dawn.  Good luck, Jack.
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.	Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.	Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?	No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...	The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.	Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man?  Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do?  Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold?...  Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs?  ...Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs?  ...Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.  I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people... Let the children of the dead Munro go free... I speak the truth.
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.	What else?
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.	...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
Yes, Mr. Poe? So?	It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.	That's all, sir.
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.	What did you see, Major?
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.	Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!	You forget yourself!
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.	And what is that?	"The Crown ""negotiating"" the terms of service?"	"I know.  One has to give Americans ""reasons"" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here."	I thought British policy is 'Make the World... England', sir.
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.	Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.	"Yes. You may.  You there. What does Munro call you?  The ""Scotsman"" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you."
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.	By your leave, sir.
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?	Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
What happened to you?	Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...	Thank you. How can I reward you?
What a place for them...	Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?	Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range, so when they're close enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. They look to be three hundred yards out.  Bloody murderers.  You have three days.
Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.	Webb's at Edward?	Yes, sir.	Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
Things were done. Nobody was spared...	Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.	"And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a ""by your leave."""
This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.	You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis.
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.	General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.	Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
Sir!	The decision is final.
Sergeant! Form three ranks!	Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready!
First rank! Second rank! Present arms!	Fire!!!
Advance, Sergeant Major!	Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
Shoulder arms!  Present!	Fire!!!
Sergeant Major!	Sir!	Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.	Atten-hut!
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!	Yes sir!
Right - about face! March! First rank present!	Fire!
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?	I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.	No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?	"""Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."""	Excuse me. What did you say?	"Magua say: ""Yes. Good idea."""
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.	Gifts?	Three, four oxen... much wampum.	Wampum?	Yes.	Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?	Yes.	Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
Gold could be arranged.	For Munro children?	Yes.	How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?	The King? The King has mountains of gold!
What is enough?	Heart. Give Magua new heart.
I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.	Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.	I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you.
We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!	British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!	Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!	This interview's over! The militia stays!	Does the rule of English law no longer govern?  Has it been replaced by absolutism?
Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?	When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?	Yes.	Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.	My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.	Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.	But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?	Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.	That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.	And this?
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?	Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!	My son Magua's pain is my pain.	Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?	Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...	Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.	And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.	Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...	Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.	You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.	However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.	Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?	Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
Such as...?	My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.	Their arms?	They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
The honors of war?	Granted.	My colors?	Carry them to England to your King with pride.	Allow me to consult with my officers.
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.	Granted, Monsieur.
Qui vive?	France.	Le mot d'ordre?	La victoire.	C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!	Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
Are you planning on working tomorrow?	Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--	We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
You mind if I take a look at this?	Be my guest.
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?	These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.	What mistakes?  Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.
What's wrong?	Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.	He did.	Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.	I'm not a doctor.	For this...you don't need to be.
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?	I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...	And?	And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...	Why Sixpack?	It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.	Yeah...right...
They found this?	No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...	Was there such a thing?	Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.	Not exactly a big ocean country.	It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...	But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?	Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...	Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?	Intelligence may not be the right word...
Be careful with it.	Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
DeJesus!  A readout!	He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!	Stay calm!
Doc eat already?	The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...	Uh, oh...I see where this is going...	...all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to---
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.	What?...
We're getting out of here just in time.	There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
It's got Hazy!	What has?	One of those chunks of Sixpack!  Like a big leech, with those teeth!...
I thought they were your friends?	Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?	He did.
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.	What dead one on the ship?
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--	Crunch...Implosion.
Jesus Christ...	Can you fix it?	No way...	Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!	I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!	No.
Go on!	No!	That's an order!	Fuck your orders!
Where the hell've you been?	I got hung up!  Try this!
Your suit, Becky!	Just get in yours!
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...	Shit...	"Williams...get DeJesus' suit on the ""sick rack"" and do a diagnostics.  Any other suit problems she should know about?"
Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!	How do you know it was Williams?	Huh?  I...uh...uh...	All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
You did good...	What?	Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...	There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...	Still...you did the right thing.
I need more light on that, Four.	Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.	You screw around like that again and--
Sixpack?	Why can't we pick up his signal?
That was a loud one wasn't it?	After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
How's astronaut training?	Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?	No.  I'm just being friendly.	Good...It's going good.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?	I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?	Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.	Has it helped?
You think I should hang around more with the crew?	"Well, I always heard you don't ""learn"" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?"
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.	Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
What can we do?	Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
Shit!  He sent them all.	The escape bubbles?
They know, don't they?	Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.	Maybe they already have.
What are you doing?	Seeing how my stock's doing...
We're on backup air.	How much time does that give us?	Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.	Can't we fix it?
We made it!	Where's Jones?
It hit me!  Where are they?!	I can't see them!
The internal monitors read normal.	Where's Doc?!	He's not at his station.
What about our quota?	You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
Something wrong, Cobb?	Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...	What's wrong with it?	...I'd really have to show it to you.	All right...
Excuse me, sir...	Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?	No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
Shut up, all of you.	Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
No!	It bit me!
Oh, God, she's out there...	Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Charge set?	Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
I'm going inside.	What's your air reading?	Twenty minutes...	Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...	Roger.
Give me a readout, DeJesus.	Ahhhh!
How do you feel, DeJesus?	Okay.	Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
Okay, number 23's full.	Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.	And it killed Bo?	No...she killed herself.
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.	Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
Thank you, Martin.	Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.	I know that.	Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision...  Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself...
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?	Beautiful.
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.	What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.	But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?	I'm not anxious to find out, either.	Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.	Do it.	Unfortunately.  We can't.
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?	It shouldn't be a long delay.	But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!	Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
Forty-eight hours!	I realize you must have gone through hell--
Made your million, yet?	Not yet.	How's TransOcean doing?
You got money in this tub?	I signed-up for the stock option.
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.	You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
Personal effects...	Timex...
I'm telling you, it's the suits!	Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.	The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
If he had his blinkers on--	It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
Who else...Sixpack.	The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.	What about his suit?  That's a million five the company's got to replace.  They'll make somebody go get it.
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?	Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
Yes sir...	Hook's on 24...
What the?...	Russian.
You read Russian?	Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
Bullshit.	...and a Russian grandmother...
What happened?	It...almost got you.	What was it?
Still bothering you?	Itches like hell.	Take it off and let me have a look.
No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!	Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
Listen to it for Christsake.	Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
So that's all you do?...	Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.	What music?  There ain't no music.
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?	Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
"""Routine,"" my ass!  Ain't nothin' ""routine"" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!"	"He didn't say it was a ""routine check-up,"" he said it was a ""routine <u>precaution</u>."""
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.	Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
What's going on?	It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
You let him get away!	I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.	That <u>thing</u> happens to be my friend.
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!	And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!	Who cares?	I do, man.  That's a beautiful place.  When I get out of here I'm going there.  Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire--
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.	This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?	What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...	You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.	I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.	He's tanking on us...
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...	I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!	I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
It's Sixpack!	I'm going to kill it!
Burritos...Enchiladas...	Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
Typhoon?!	Twelve hours!
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.	'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
How'd you do that?	What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
Getting some food.	Under there?
Look.  Water.	Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
How far away is she?	Two hundred meters.
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.	The infirmary?...	Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?	We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
We've got to get him to the infirmary.	What are you going to do to him?	I'm going to try to remove it.	I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?	It's had a meal.
It would explain the suction- like appendages.	Like a leech.
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...	No fuckin' lie...	...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy...  but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!	I don't know.  I'm guessing.
Clear for pickup.	Let's hope it holds.
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?	Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
What is it?	"""Debbie Does Dallas""...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it..."
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...	"Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about ""whys,"" they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month."
Who were you talking to?	Sixpack...	How is he?	Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
What on earth's the matter with you?	I ought to smack your face!
What's wrong?	DeJesus...It's got him.
It needs blood?	Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...	Oh man, that's just great...
What is it?	The good doctor signed our death warrant.
What is it?	The air's stopped.
The shack...	She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
Don't spend all day down there.	Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Are you sure you saw something?	How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.	Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
Are you okay, Jonesy?	Tip top, Willie...tip top.	Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?	Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
It saw us!	Answer them and quit kicking me!	I'm not touching you!
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?	Your pocket?	The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.	Right.
Bitch!  Look what you did!	Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
What's wrong, did you miss me?	Hardly.	Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.	He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
I'll kill him!	Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?	Probably no longer than four weeks.	A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?	Well, it's still a good idea.
How much did you part with?	Seven hundred for the pair.
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?	I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
A what?	A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
I wanted to talk to you about that.	Well, talk.	Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him.
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.	Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.	I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?	At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.	It's hit us all hard!	Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.	Jesus, Tom, do they work?
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.	The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.	The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.	I still will, if you don't mind.
Because it's cheap like a budgie.	And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.	I'll think of something, don't worry.
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.	They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
Yes?	It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.	I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
Bacon, see what we got.	Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?	I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!	That inspires confidence, that does.
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.	Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
Well?	Well what?
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.	Apart from those shotguns.	And Tom took care of them.
What's that?	A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.	No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.	You want a pint, go to the pub.	I thought this was a pub.	It's a Samoan pub.	Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?	You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
Like what?	Like antiques.	Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?	If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!	You get the guns?	You should see what they did to poor Gary.
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.	Where're the others?
There are no others.	Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?	I don't know what you mean.	There were two old guns there; where are they?	Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.	They were . . .	I am not fucking interested.
You fucking well have to get 'em!	We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.	Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .	Yeah, Bazza, what?	You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.	Better than good, he is a fucking liability.	Where did he get a hundred grand?
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?	No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.	Good, you can get this under control now.
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?	Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?	Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.	Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.	It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?	You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.	I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?	Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
I hate these Southern shites.	Fucking Northern monkeys.
JD.	Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?	Nope.	Can I help?	I think I can help you, as it happens.	Yes?	I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.	Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?	No Harry, you can't.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?	Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
Have you counted the money?	Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.	They were going to pay, then?	It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.	Good job, Chris.
Mind your language in front of my boy.	Jesus Christ!
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.	I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.	Son, have a look in his locker.	No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
Hello, John. Nice holiday?	I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.	I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.
Son?	Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
You all right back there, mate?	Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?	It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137	Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.	All right, furry muff.
What are you doing?	Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.	You had better be careful.
How long has he been in there, son?	About twenty minutes.	Is he on his own?	Just carrying a bag.	Let's have a look, shall we?
It's not him, Dad.	Try that one.
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?	All right, Dad.	Well, put your seatbelt on then.
Yeah?	That's no way to answer the phone.	Is that you, Dean?	Sure is.	What can I do for you?	You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.	Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.	I got the money to pay for 'em.	I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to see them or the guns again.
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?	All right, Kenny.
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?	It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.
Who was that?	That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.	Jesus, I have heard about him.	We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
We gotta get those guns.	This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.	Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.	Furry muff, let's go.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.	What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.	It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?	Er well, yes we do.	In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking Everest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a mon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first fucking idea who did this to us, do you?
Dog, I have found the cash!	The stupid bastards! Count it!	Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?	We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.	But...  Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.
So do you know these geezers well?	Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.	What they like then?	Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.	What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?	I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.	Is there no way they can get back to you?	Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots.
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.	There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?	No.	And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?
	Just hold on, I got the keys.
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?	I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
It must be this one.	Just give me the keys.
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.	Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
Yeah, one of them's out.	OK, open the gate.
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?	How about you? All right?
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.	What the fuck is going on?
J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.	Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.
Right, his leg's going now.	All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
And all your friends, there's a good lad.	There is only three of us here.	Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?	I mean it, there is only three of us here.	Plank?
Where?	Out the back.	And the weed?	Out the back.
Invitations.	Invitations?	Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.	Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?	All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.	Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .	Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?	Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
Well, what do you want us to do about it?	Hit the fuckers.
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?	Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!	Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .	Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.	Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.	No, just one of them is in charge of them going to the job. So I assume he will still
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.	Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.	Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.	And look what happened to that.	If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.
That's it all done, we are off.	You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?	There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.
I hope this is the right move.	It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
You what? What are you on about?	Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
Well, what's going on?	I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.	Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
There's nothing in it!	What do you mean?	I mean it's fucking empty.
Who's this fat man, then?	Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.	The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
What do you mean?	He means they're thieving dogs.
What the hell are you doing here?	Why, what's up?	Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.	Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
Everything all right out there, Tom?	Right as rain.	Where the hell are we supposed to hide?
Well, what did he say?	He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
You and me, Tom.	What do you mean, me?
Tom, this is our case.	. . . What?	This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.	I'11 meet you in the car.	Tom?	I'll only be a minute.
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?	We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
You got it all?	A hundred grand.
You must be Eddy. JD's son.	Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.	Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.	Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
I will.	You will what?	I will loan you the money.
I think I would rather just turn them over.	I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.	I need two hundred and fifty grand.	No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
That's if I want to see you.	Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
I'll see ya.	For half a million?	Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.	And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?
That you, boy?	It's Ed, if that's what you mean.	It's pay day, ain't it?	I wanted to talk to you about that.	I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!
Go on.	I like your bar.	Yes?	I want your bar.	And?	Do you want me to draw a picture?	Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.	What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.	And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!
Hello, can I help you?	All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?	No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.	Well, perhaps you can help?	Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.	Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?	I can't help you, Plank.	I think you'll find it is in your interest.	Hold on. OK.  Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.	I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.	Lives and learns doesn't one.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.	I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.	What are you doing, Plank?	What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.	Of course you are. All right, Ed.
How much did you say it was, Tom?	You know how much it is, Nick.	And that does include the amp?	You know it doesn't include the amp.
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.	Doesn't sound very good to me.	Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses.
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.	Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.	Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?	I think you're Nick the Greek.
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?	I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.	They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?	Seven hundred each.
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.	Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.	Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.	All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?	Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.	I'll only be a minute.	You've already been fifteen.
Look. Go on, look.	At what, exactly?	My van is half full.	So?	So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.
What have you come as?	Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.	If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?	Get your fingers out of my soup!
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.	That's going on optimism.	Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.	You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.	Tom, you're all heart.	Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?	It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!	Well, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any difference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking bullets!
Where did you get those from, a museum?	Nick the Greek.
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?	When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
What's left over?'	Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.	What about all the gear?
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?	I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.	You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.	Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?	Six.	How many wings have they got between them?	Twelve.	How many feet?	Er, well, twelve.	That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?	How the fuck should I know?	How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?]
The money, the gear!	That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.	OK, don't panic; let's think about this.
Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?	The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.
What are you carrying, Willy?	Er, fertilizer.	You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.	We need fertilizer, Winston.	We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?	What do you mean?	I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.
You jerk--	I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?	I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--	And those stupid girls who hang out with them--	Just shut up.
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.	So?	It's pathetic. You can't be desperately in love when you're 14 years old.
I don't know what the big deal is.	You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.	Oh, come on, Amado--	Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--	Leave your sister out of it.	You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun.
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--	I can't take any more school.	--you're going to be on your own.	So?	So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.	They're not going to jail.	Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.	Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.	That makes it okay?	They stole our land--	Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
How do you think you're going to make a living?	I can fix cars.	You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--	You think I can't learn that?	I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--	I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.	That isn't true.	Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--	If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled.
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.	I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.	And what did she do?	Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.	Catholic school, nasty.
Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?	No, sir--	Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?	I'm sorry, sir.	When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.	Yes, sir--	Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?	I-I can do the job, sir.	You don't sound too enthusiastic.	I am, sir.	What exactly do you think your job is, Private?	Follow orders. Do whatever they say.	"Who's ""they""?"	The--the officers.	And that's the job? Nothing about serving your country?
Well?	You really want to know, sir?	Please.	It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
How do you think I got to be a colonel?	Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.	Do whatever they tell you--	I mean, follow orders, sir.	With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.	I do, sir.	Because it's a job?	Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--	Chaos.
"Why do you think they let us in on the ""deal""?"	They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.	Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?	No, sir. Not at all.	Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?	No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
Why don't you start with that?	Yes, sir.	You're dismissed, Private.	Thank you, sir.
So you knew this young man before?	From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--	I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?	He'll live.
Out of the Army?	He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--	Will this go on my record?
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.	Thank you, Sergeant Major.	You're dismissed.	Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?	If I had I wouldn't have gone in.	And you and Private Graves--	We were just dancing--
We're not running a dating service here.	I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
Private Johnson!	Sergeant?	Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.	I'm feeling okay--	I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.	You're testing me?	You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.	Yes, Sergeant.
Sam the Man.	Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
How's business?	Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.	I hear they're closing that post down.	September '97, that's all she wrote.	Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.	Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
That the word on our boy?	Yeah, this is Skinny.	Skinny?	We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.	Nice job.	Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--	Charley Wade.	That badge--	--it didn't come out of a cereal box.	Yeah.	You know the popular version of how he left town.	Everybody on the border knows that story.	You got a cause of death?	Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.	So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?	Colt Peacemaker.	A .45--	He swore by it.  What?	Just wondering.	So is Buddy on your short list?	If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.	You got to investigate. No question about it.	What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.	Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
What's that for?	Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.	So?	"I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is ""Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."""
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.	There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.	That's not the point.	You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--	I'm not picking it up.	You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?	Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
Whole different story; isn't it?	You're fired. You're outta the department.	There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.	You little pissant--	Now or later, Charley. You won't have any trouble finding me.
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--	That's in Maverick County.
Oh. Right. And you're in--?	Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--	You still going to all the home games?	"Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6"", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?"	Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?	Do I seem jumpy?	No, you look good. I was just wondering.	Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--	You look good--	--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--	Yeah, well--	--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.	You were in a fight--	"Daddy calls it an ""altercation."" How you doing, Sam? You look skinny."	Same weight I always was.	You look awful good in that uniform, though.	Best part of the job.	"Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says ""Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now""."	Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?	"Least he never called me that. With me, it was always ""high-strung."" ""My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung."" Or ""tightly wound,"" that was another one. You seeing anyone?"	No. You?	Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.	You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--	You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?	Suppose not.	You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--	It wasn't just you, Bunny.	No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
350 pounds.	What?	This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.	I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.	"""I only got my little girl now,"" he says, ""she's my lifeline."" Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people."	You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.	Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--	So that's him--
Hey, it's the General.	Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?	Come on in--	If it's too late--	Come on in.
You've been in this house for a while?	I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.	I never met her.	There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
Where'd he get all this?	Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--	Uncle Al--	Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.	I'm a colonel.	Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?	It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.	Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.	My mother said he never asked about--	He never asked her.
You weren't in here tonight, were you?	No sir.	Go out through the back.
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.	He a Black man or an Indian?	Both.
He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--	The Trail of Tears.	They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.	So they stayed in Florida?	They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass.
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--	They fought against the Indians?	Same as they done in Mexico.	But they were Indians themselves.	They were in the Army. Like your father.	You know who I am?	I got a pretty good guess.	That guy who got shot--	You didn't go telling your father you were here?	Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?	He's a pretty tough old man, huh?	No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--	PDA?	Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--	Well--	I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--	Didn't have a father?	He's still pissed off about it.	When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
So how come you got into all this?	These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--	So I'm part-Indian?	By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.	My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.	Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.	Dad--
Dad--?	"""Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"""
Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.	Dad, can I talk to you about track?
Dad, I talked to the track coach--	I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--	I have a B average.	How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
Homework?	I finished that. I'm just messing around.	Tanks, huh?	You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.	So you're going into the Army?
Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.	You wouldn't?	No.
How's your room shaping up?	Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.	Good.
Are we going to ever see your father?	My father.	Yeah. He lives here, right?	He does.
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.	Cool.
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.	You own this place?	This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.	You lived in the States for a while?	Fifteen years in El Paso.	Made some money, came back here--	Something like that.	You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?	Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it	My government can go fuck itself, and so can yours. I'm talking about people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio Cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day--
This place is a gold mine.	Lead mine.
What?	It's a lead mine.	Right.	I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.	You finding lots of cactus and shit?	It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--	Looks like a lot of cactus to me.	Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.	Cliff--	You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--	Cliff--
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,	He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--	We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.	You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.	I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.	You going to get married?	Maybe.	You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?	Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--	Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice.  But marriage, man--I did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married for five years--I couldn't tell you which experience was worse.
Hey, Mikey--	I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--	Mikey--	Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--	Mikey--	If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--	Mikey look at this--	What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.	It's a .45.	Yeah?	This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--	They were using M-1's, yeah--	What's it doing on a rifle range?
He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--	He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
You spoil 'em, Cliff.	Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--	But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.	She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
So where does that put us?	Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.	Seriously.	Seriously, I think we should get married.	We been through this before--	We should just do it.	And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--	You could take it--	It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--	I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.	Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.	You know who it was they dug up?
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.	This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.	I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.	That ring--	Masons been around a long while.
Treasure hunter?	Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.	Pleased to meet you.	Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--	If the next guy's a redneck.	--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.	Good deal you were born down here, then.	You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.	You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.	Take that pair over in the corner--
--warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored	--but just as a kind of safety tip.	Yeah. I bet he would.	Old Sam stood for somethin', you know? The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold.
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.	Have we had trouble there before?
You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--	Substance abuse?	Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--	I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.	Appreciate it, sir.
Black Seminoles?	Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
That where he was shot?	That's where he fell.	You get much of that in here?	It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--	Deal drugs in the bathroom--	If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.	Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
So.	So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.	This is an official visit, then--	I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.	We have an enlisted man's club at the post.	Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.	That's right.	I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.	The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.	Right.	I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.	Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.	And people make their choice--	A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
I gonna meet that family of yours?	Why would you want to do that?	Because I'm your father.
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]	No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]	What's in the back?
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.	I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.	I haven't seen anybody doing that.	This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?	Eladio Cruz.	You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
Reputation?	Bandidos, Injuns--
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.	Protection?	You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.	Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--	Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that.
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]	Aqui! [Here!]
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]	Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--]	No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't worry. We've got her.]
Como se llama? [What's your name?]	Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.	Me llama Eladio Cruz--Bienvenido a Tejas. [Welcome to Texas.]
Es muy lindo, su coche--	En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.	Is very beautiful, your car.	Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--	Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction--
Senora Cruz?	Quien es? [Who is it?]	Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid]
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?	Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]	In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--	I have some friends who have had a accident--	You have somebody else out there?	We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--	Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?	We was crossin' the river--
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?	They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]	You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--	No es la verdad--[That isn't true--]
This girl is a friend of yours?	Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]	I thought you were married!	I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--	This girl has a child?	We have a daughter.	Tipico.
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!	Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]	A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.	Senora, anything it costs, I can work--	Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors.
"""Fishbait,"" says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, ""What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?"" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, ""C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"""	Buddy Deeds. He had a way.	"He known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up. ""Old Fishbait,"" he says, ""never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it."""
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.	He was a unique individual.
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.	Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?	King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--	Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish--
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--	That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
Tell that one, Hollis--	Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--	'57, 1 believe--	And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade. Charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county.
"""Mas cerveza por favor."""	That Buddy was a cool breeze.
Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.	We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
Your mother was a saint.	--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
Historic occasion, isn't it?	Seems like we have another one every week.	Jorge and his Chamber of Commerce boys got to keep things hummin'--
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.	Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.	We don't need a new jail.	That's a matter of interpretation--	We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--	We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
When we backed you--	When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.	Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--	--Santiago.	Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news--
That so?	She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
Never heard from him again?	Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.	Right.	Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.	Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--	Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--	Sounds great. Where do I sign up?	I haven't been out here for a while.	You go by your old house?	No.	Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--	We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?	You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?	Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?	All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?	I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--	Bledso	He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--	He still living?	No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?	Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
Besides my father, I mean.	There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.	And Buddy was one of them.	We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.	People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.	And I understand why you might want to think he could.
Morning, Hollis.	Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.	You thought any more about our murder?	We have a murder?	Charley Wade.	I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.	I got an idea what happened.	Do you?	I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?	I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
Fellas.	Hey, Sam.	Open late.
Imonna find out one way or the other.	Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--	Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--	Buddy Deeds--	Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.	And the ten thousand?	Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late--
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.	Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
We're building up tourism, Sam--	People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--	Sam--	"You ought to put up a banner-- ""Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy""--"
I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.	The Perdido thing?	He agreed it wasn't exactly news--	Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
There was a mandate in the last election--	It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--	Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
Steve called for you.	Steve?	Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.	Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.	Your mother's family is Spanish?	Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.	You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.	All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.	How 'bout the Sheriff?	The Sheriff.	The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--	I'm unmarried. I'm not available.	You told me one time it was true love.
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.	Maybe you're just getting less patient.	If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!	Well, you hire illegals--	Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.	If you spent a little more time training them--	Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?	No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--	Why would I want to go there?	Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--	You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them.
Mami, how old were you when my father--	He was killed.	Right. When he was killed.	A little older than Paloma is now.	How come you never got married again?
There must have been somebody.	I was too busy.	Nobody's too busy.	Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?	Thank you.	I don't mean Fernando.	"Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- ""some chulo with grease under his nails."""	I never said that.	You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.	I felt that you could do better for yourself--	What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--	I never said that. It was just that boy--	"""That boy""--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!"
Mrs. Bledsoe?	That's me.	I'm Sheriff Deeds--	Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.	Yeah, that's the story of my life.	You ever play one of these?	I've seen 'em.	Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.	You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?	I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.	He had the club out on the old trail road--	We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.	So you must remember Sheriff Wade.	Not if I can help it.	You had to deal with him in running the club.	Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.	He squeezed money out of you?	"Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, ""Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership."" But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime."	And my father?	Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.	People didn't complain?	Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.	Do you remember the last time you saw him?
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?	Okay? He's not here?	No. Is he sick?	He's going to wish he was dead.
I don't think you can take it personally--	I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--	I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.	And that was the last time you saw him?
Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.	That was the night he disappeared?	Could of been. That was white people's business.	And when my father was Sheriff?	What about it?	What was your deal with him?
Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.	He ever accept cash for a favor?
I'm not open. We were just talking.	Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.	Yeah. How about that? People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up.
Not if you have half a brain in your head.	Of course you can.	What?	It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
Mom?	Yeah?	You gonna stay out here?	For a while.
What's she singing about?	What do you think?
She finally got in--	It's Saturday.	You got in late last night.	Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
Can I get this?	Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.	I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--	Enough with the clothes--	Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.	I only went for my last two years.	How come?	Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
Morning, Sheriff.	Hey, Pete. How's it going?	Time marches on.	How much you got left?	Three months.	You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.	It was for personal consumption.	You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?	I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.	I thought he busted you a couple times.	Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
That's how I ruined my stomach.	I'm surprised he bothered with it.	He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--	So I've heard--	And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.	Well, you were working there--	It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
You built our patio while you  were on the county?	Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--	I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--	He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?	Murdered him?	Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
Something wrong?	They've got my Amado.	Got him here?	Somebody called--something about an electronics store.	I'll see what's going on.
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.	We haven't talked since high school.	Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.
He's all yours.	Are you okay?
Field trip?	Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.	Want to take a walk?
Your mother still doesn't like me.	I can't name anybody she does like these days.	I see she built a place up here by the river.	A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--	She's done well for herself--on her own and all--	So she tells me three times a week.
I thought you got through that pretty well.	They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.	People liked him.	Most people did, yeah.	I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--	Yeah.	Weird what you remember.
Your boy, there--	Amado.	Nice-looking kid.	He hates me.	No--	With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.	Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--	Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.	It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.
So why did you come back here, Sam?	Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--	You don't want to be Sheriff.	I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.	It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.	You've got your mother, your kids--	They've got me. Different thing.
I should get back.	Pilar--	Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
We thought we were something, didn't we?	Yeah.	I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.	Yeah.	I mean what did we know about anything?	Nothing.
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.	You know the other day, you asked why I came back?	Yeah?	I came back 'cause you were here.
Wow.	Yeah.	How come it feels the same?	I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.	So what are we gonna do about this?	More, I hope.
How long have you lived here?	Two years.	There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--	Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.	Like your story is over.	I've felt that way, yeah.
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--	Pilar--	Yeah?	What was your father's name?	Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?	She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.	You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?	Couple months before I was born--	Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.	Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--	They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--	"He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you ""our beautiful daughter"" in the letters she wrote to him."	From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.	I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--	If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
We start from scratch--	Yeah--	Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--	The shooter local?	Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.	Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.	Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?	Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
You're out early.	Yeah.	Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.	I been working on a few things.	Uh-huh.	I'm going over to the other side.	The Republicans?	No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.	They got telephones.	Gotta be in person.	Oh.
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--	They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.	Yeah.	You'd do a good job.	How 'bout you?	Don't know if I'll still want it.	I didn't want to be going around your back.	I appreciate you telling me.
You think we need a new jail?	Well, it's a complicated issue--
Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.	You don't need to cuff me.	You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now--
"You're the one who's a good boy. Man say ""fetch"" and you fetch--"	Just doing my job.	White man just using you to keep the Black man down.	This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.	You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo.
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--	That the problem, son?  You Slow?	Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--	You telling me what to do, Roderick?	No, Sheriff, I'm just--
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--	This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--	And people better clear out of here! Now!
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.	What's up?	We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.	I haven't seen anybody come by.	We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?	Yeah. It's quiet--	I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.	Sure.	The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella--
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.	You sell much out here?	How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.	Hell of a spot to put a business.	But you don't see much competition, do you?
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.	So when did Buddy leave?	For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.	You think he killed anybody in Korea?	They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?	No--	Me neither.
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.	Another woman?	Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.	You know who it was?	The other one? Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one. Your head's all crowded up--here it is--
I know you?	Name's Otis.	Otis what?	Payne.	One of Cleroe Payne's boys?	Uh-huh.	I sent your Daddy to the farm once.	I know that.	Why you think that was?
As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?	Runnin' numbers illegal.	Runnin' numbers without I know about it is both illegal and unhealthy. You remember that.
How come you don't took familiar?	Been away. Up to Houston.	Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there.
You going to tell her?	You going to tell him?	He doesn't need to know all my business.	He's gonna find out.	So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.	You believe that?
Mister D'Amour?	Yeah.  It's French.
Yeah?	You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.	How much?	Thirty-five bucks.	Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
Hello, L.A.	Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.	You bet.
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.	They go together.	I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.	Who?	Nix.	Nix?	Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.	Who is he?	I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.	How?	It'll be something hokey.
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.	You heard right.	You ever been married?	Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.	Why?	My life was too weird for her.	I love weird.
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?	Nope.
I could have lost my fucking hands.	That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
That's Butterfield...	doorway) And who's that?
Take a look at this.	A Nix specialty?
Maybe they're not tricks.	I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?	What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --	Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.	That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.	Knew what?
Hokey enough for you?	I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
Thanks, Billy.	Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
How'd you spell that again?	D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.	D'Amour.	Right.	Isn't that French for something?
Right.	That's so cool.
You did.  Didn't you?	Why would I do that?	Beats me.
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?	Deep shit?
Who did this?	I told you --
Who did this?	All right.  It was...
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?	I know him.  I saw him.
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.	He's a priest?	No.  He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit.  Like you.
I don't want him getting in the way.	He won't.
We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.	"What do you mean, ""all of us?"""	You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.	About?	Death.	What about death?	It's an illusion.
Please.	I could scoop them out.	Don't.	So tell me where Nix is buried.	I don't know.
I'll tell you.	You'll do more.than that.
Anything?	Not yet.
If you've lied to me to me --	I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!	It's him... it's him.
Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?	It was me.
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.	Why did you wait so long?	I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.	And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?	If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.	What is he?	Maybe he'll show you.
Do you wish him to be amongst us?	Yes...	Will you come to him on your knees?	Yes...	Be ready.
He's with us...	He's with us... He's with us...
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.	Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.	Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.  They knew the Puritan was coming home.
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?	Yes.	And are you afraid?	Yes.
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.	Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.	Did your husband know Quaid?	Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.	You don't?	I think we make our own futures.
What's the connection?	I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.	Why not?
He's a secretive man.	And you don't ask questions?	We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.	Does that mean...?	We haven't slept in the same bed for years.	But obviously you still care what happens to him.	We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
You don't believe me.	He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
Sorry.  You asked.	No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,	Where do I sign?
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?	Harry.	Harry.	I'm no bodyguard.	That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.	When do you want me to start?	Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.	Do you?
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?	Sure.
He's good.	You haven't seen anything yet.
Are they treating you okay?	I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.	I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...	I don't know where you'd start.	Well... how about some of the other illusionists?	They won't tell you anything.	I can be very persuasive.	Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.	Forget the fee.  If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money.  If I don't...  ...my gamble.  Either way... I get to spend some time... here.
How did it go today?	I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
They were jealous of him.	Why?  Because he had you?	He... didn't have me..  I told you-	You didn't marry him for love.
So why did you marry him?	That's my business. Harry.	Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?	Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.	What about Jennifer Desiderio?	It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.	Okay.  I'll keep digging.	Yes.  You do that.
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?	I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
What did you find?	Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
Oh Christ.	Why don't you tell me the truth?
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?	It was more than that, I think.	He was the real thing, right?	Swann said he could do stuff, yes.	Stuff?	He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.	He taught all this to Swann?	Some or it.
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.	I told you --	Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.	No.	You said you weren't with him for love.	I wasn't.	What then?	I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.	He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
It's okay.	No it isn't.  You can't help me.	I'm here, aren't I?
Nothing's going to happen to you.	Nothing?	Nothing you don't want.
I was so afraid.	Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.	Are you sure?	I'm sure.  He's dead.	I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.	And they all came...	Yes.	Quaid and Jennifer--	And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
What was that?	It's okay.
Are you all right?	Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
Harry?	It's all right.  It's not hurting...
Oh God!	Hang on!
I've got to help him.	You can't.	Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
No!  No!  No!	Harry...
... oh... God...	I'm here, Harry.	...yes?	Yes.
Don't look.	I... have... to.
Harry?	I'm okay.  I'm okay.
Is it finished?	I think so.
What the fuck?	Harry-?	Out!  Out!
Valentin?	Good.  There.  Yes?	You saw this?
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.	No word from D'Amour?
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.	Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.	I left three messages already.
What about me?	Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
Bad show last night?	The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...	... they believe you.	Yeah.  Remember Quaid?	Sure.	Somebody killed him.	Oh God.	I just saw him.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?	Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?	No.  I'm not going near him.
What were you doing up there?	I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.	Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.	Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.	What makes you so sure?	I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?	New one on me.  Okay.  Let's see him.
Where the fuck is he?	He got up and walked.	After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
And this Butterfield guy--	--vanished.	Another fucking magician. Jesus.
Are you finished with me?	For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?	No.  Not yet...
You believe that?	I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...	Heaven and Hell?
Trickery and divinity.	Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?	No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.	So could you walk on water?	I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.	What about Swann's miracles?
They weren't worth a damn.	I heard he was the best.	If he was so good why's he so dead?
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.	Oh, I've got plenty.	I'd like to hear them.
I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.	Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?	He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
With what?	Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?	Fuck you.
Shit.	Mr. D'Amour?	Go away.	It's one in the afternoon.	What are you, my mother?	I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --	We've never met.	Then what do you want?	I'm here to offer you a job.	I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.	Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
Whose is the car?	Mine.	Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.	Maybe I just bought it.	Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?	You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.	Philip Swann?	You know of him?	I saw him in Vegas once.	Are you a gambling man?	When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.	Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.	What's the difference?	Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
Any movie stars buried here?	Probably.	It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.	I don't think the dead much care.	Are you sure?	Are you a believer, then?
Who is she?	Swann's wife.
What the fuck are you doing here?	Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.	Why'd you come here?	You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.	What for?	A ticket home,	You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.	She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.	Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.	Yes.  It's regrettable	Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.	What for?  You need to stay busy?	I like to know why things happen.	Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.	No.
I want to speak to Dorothea.	I'm afraid she's not in.	When will she be in?
I can't let you in.	Yeah, I know.	You want more money, is that it?
Leave her alone --	Shut up!
Are you satisfied now?	No.
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?	Yes.	You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?	Yes.	And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann	I tried to pay you off.	Was that Swann's idea?	No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.	Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.	Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
I want to see Swann face to face.	Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
D'Amour --	Shit...	Help me.
Him too.	We've got to get you to a hospital.	Don't bother.	Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.	I'm sorry, D'Amour...	What about?	... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.	A Mister Quaid?	Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.	I won't say anything.
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.	What's her problem?	She has no real grip on reality.	Does anybody?	Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.	And what does Jennifer think's real?
You need an ambulance.	Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
My God.	What?	You've taken some strange journeys in your life.	Yeah.  You could say that.	You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.	Not much.	You can't change it.  You have to walk...  ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it.
Hold on.	I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...	The Puritan?	Yes...	Who is he?
Where'd you learn that?	What?	That.	At birth.  I don't know you --	Harry D'Amour.	I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.	I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.	What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.	Was he taking a lot of risks?	You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.	Not the Walter Wilder?
You know Vinovich?	Sure.  Vivovich.	He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.	I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.	People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?	For what?	For an introduction.	Well... nobody.
I only wear ties for funerals.	You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
Are they all in the business?	It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.	Have you been in?	No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.	They'll never find out.
Look, Ma, no wires.	You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.	How the fuck do you do that?	Now I'm going to have to kill you.	I don't think so.  You need me alive.	Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.	Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.	Or murdered, like Nix.	He deserved it.	Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?	I did it for Dorothea.	Oh yeah?	Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
So Nix won't come looking for her?	It's me betrayed him.	And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.	I don't know what else to do.	Help me.
Oh Jeez.	Will that do?  No?
You think I'm an asshole.	Didn't know you read minds.	I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...	Is that all?	I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.	And you're not?
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.	And he didn't have them?	He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.	Is that all?	No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...	And you believed him?	I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth.  Are you ready for that?
Did she know where Nix was buried?	No.	Who else did?  Did Valentin?	Yes.	Jesus!
They got here before us.	Looks that way.
... no...	He's better off this way.	Nobody's better off this wav!	You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
That's where we're all going.	In my time, and nobody else's.
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?	At a guess... they just resurrected him.	Fuck.
This is where we killed him.	You didn't try hard enough.	I can't... I can't go any further...
He did something with the ground.	Yes?	Can you do it?	I don't know.	Try.
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.	No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.	You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?	I got to go.  I'm late.	Call me tomorrow.	There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.	Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.	A couple of weeks.	One question.	What?	Who is she?
Have we met before?	No.	Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,	Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.	Maybe... I... don't...	What about Philip Swann?	I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
Why's that?	He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.	What is?	I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.	Swann?
He's not!  He's not!	Who's not?
Nix! Nix!	Is he the Puritan?	Yes! Yes!	And he's dead?	No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out!
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.	Fuck you.	You don't think I've got it to give?	No!
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.	You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
Swann?  What are you doing?	Binding you.
And?	I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
You could still help me do that.	Why would I want to?	Because you've got nothing else to live for.	Not true.	The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.	Yes.	But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.	Yes.
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?	No!	Liar!
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?	We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.	Yeah, they told me.	These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?	Just get me out of here as soon as you can.	Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...	Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.
Hello?	Bob, it's me.	Oh, hi, Elaine.	So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.	Ok.	You'll do it?	Yeah, I'll stay.
What are you doing here?	My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
What about you? Why are you here?	My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.	How long have you been married?	Two years.	Try twenty-five.	You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?	I'm thinking about it.	25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?	Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.	Oh.	What do you do?	I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.	What did you study?	Philosophy.	Oh, what do you do with that?	I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.	It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.	Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.	Thanks.
Hi again, how's it going?	Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Oh, hi.	Hi. Did you have a nice swim?	Yeah. Did you get some sleep?	No, how about you?	Not really. How long are you here for?	I'm here for the week.	Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?	Ok.	See you later.
You really are having a mid-life crisis.	I know, it's stupid.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?	No.
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.	Hi, Charlie.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?	No way.
I could cut the ones that are left for you.	Ok.
I don't want to go home.	I know. I don't either.
Hello?	It's Charlotte.	Charlotte, who?	Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
Of course.	Do you want to have some breakfast?
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.	OK, see you downstairs.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.	I see them every morning.
Hans was very attentive to you.	I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?	No, its easy.	How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?	I don't know.
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.	But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.	Really?	Yeah, you don't remember?
Did I scowl at you?	No, you smiled.	I don't remember.	I know, I kind of blend in here.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?	"I don't know. My fax said ""have a good fright""."	Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.	Ok, whatever you want.	Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?	No, I was looking at you.	Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...	I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.	Oh, for her show?	No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.	Oh.	You're possessive.	I know.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.	No, yes, it does...	Yeah? But look at you.	Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...	I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...	You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.	But, I'm mean.	That's ok.	And marriage, does that get easier?	It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.	Did that help? Did you learn anything?	We established that we have no communication.	Oh.	We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.	That's too scary.	When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.	No one ever tells you that...	But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.	That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.	Where'd you grow up?	In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
I know.	John thinks I'm so snotty.	You are.	I know, but that's what you like about me.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?	Because that would be too easy.
You made it.	They really have to work on that street name thing.
It's for my daughter.	How old is she?	Four.	Oh, she'll love it.
Nice one.	Fuck off.
What happened to your toe?	I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
It's bad isn't it?	We should get you to the doctor.	You think so?	Yeah, look at that thing.
Where's your husband?	Working.	Do you ever see him?	Yeah.	Do you know where we are?	No.
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?	Yes, but no, I can't right now.
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.	I don't want to be.
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?	No, we'll find something around here.
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.	You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
What do you want to drink?	A coke.
So, where'd you go today.	Around.
I'm sorry.	That lunch was the worst, huh.
When are you leaving?	Tomorrow.	I'm going to miss you.	That's what you said the other night.	Well, I mean it more now.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.	I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.	Why can't it last?	I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
Charlotte?	Hi, Bob.	I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?	Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.	That'd be great.
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?	Yes, no.
You're leaving right now?	Yes.	Well... have a good flight.	Thanks.	Ok, bye.
Why are you crying?	I'll miss you.
Mr. Harris?	Yes?	Mr. Kazuzo sent me.	Oh?	Can I enter?
Mr. Harris?	Yes?	Do you like massage?	I don't think so.	Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.
My stockings.	Yes?	Take them.
Lydia?	Hello, darling.	Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.	Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.	He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...	That sounds great  can you hold on...  What Zoe?
Yeah, its really different here.	Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?	It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.	Ok, well... I love you.	I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .	Good-night.
Hello?	Bob?	Hi, Lydia.	Is this a bad time?	Uh, no.	It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.	Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.	It's just carpet.	That's not what I'm talking about.	What are you talking about?	I don't know.	Is there anything I can do?	I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.	What?	You know, eat healthier.	Alright?	Not all that pasta.	Fine.	Like Japanese food.	Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.	Oh, come on.	I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?	Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.
Hello?	Hello, Bob, it's me.	Hello?	It's Lydia, your wife.	I couldn't hear you. How are you?	Fine. Is it going ok?	It's ok.	Do you want to-	What?	Do you want to talk to  Zoe?	Yeah.	Zoe, come say hello to your father...
I guess she's busy.	That's ok.	When are you coming home?	Tomorrow.	Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.	Ok.
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.	Bye.
Hello?	Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!	Ok.	Do you want I send it to your room?	Great.	Thank you, Mr. Harris.
"How do you say ""hospital"" in Japanese?"	Excuse me?	Hospital?	One moment, please.
Hello? Yes?	Hello, can I have room 5601.	One moment.
Evelyn Waugh?	What?	Evelyn Waugh was a man.
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.	Why do you have to defend her?	I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.	No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
How'd it go today?	Good...I'm tired.
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.	Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.	You wanna come?	Sure.	Ok.
No, what are you talking about.	I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.	That's ok.
I don't know what to do.	That's ok, you'll figure it out.
You smell weird.	What?
Like popcorn?	I got some hair stuff.
Hair stuff?	I gotta go to work.
See you later.	Bye.
Yeah.	Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...
Do you think it's done?	I don't know.
Will you please stop smoking?	But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.	Its bad for you.	Ok, I will... later.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?	Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.	You don't have to be embarrassed.	I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.	It's ok if you are.
Oh, the record company sent these...	Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.	I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.
Are you sure you want to stay?	Are you sure you have to go?
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.	Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
I miss you.	It'll just be a few days.
Lauren?	Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?	It's cool... but,I don't know... I went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, I didn't feel anything... I even tried ikebana, ...   and John's using hair products... I don't know who I.
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?	Sure.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.	Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.	Ok, bye.
John! What are you doing here?	I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?	Promoting that action movie I did...
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?	We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.	It's amazing  there!	Have you met Charlotte? My wife.	No!  Hi! So great to meet you!
Uh..thanks.	Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
Oh no...	...Well, I have the worst  headache, I have to go find some aspirin. But, call me, let's have a drink, I'm under Evelyn Waugh.
I missed you.	Do you think they have a room here?
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.	She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.	It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay.
You never said anything to me...	It's probably trivial.
Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.	Bad?	Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...	I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?	Uh...sure...I...what?	Sushi.
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.	Hmmm.	You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight.  Quarks and dark matter, things like that.  Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
Peter, where are you?	Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.	Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?	Says she can get me in to see this killer.	Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.	No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?	Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?	I spaced out.	"Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the ""stop"" button?"
What?  That's horrible!	What happened?
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.	When did they find her?
I'm still shaking.	I can't believe Will killed him.	Thank God he did.
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.	I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?	No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...	Yeah, like...	Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.	It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.	Well, it shattered your faith in everything.	I'm just temporarily off my game.	You need to believe in something besides yourself.	I believe in you.
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?	Claire...	This is the person...you were talking about?
What're these?	I don't know.  What are they?	I found them in your file box.	Must be a spare set.	I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?	I found the pentacle.
She's been stalking you, Peter.	So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!	You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.	We're still going to be together.
What a...jerk!	Peter, are you okay?
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?	Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.	Well, if Peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you...
...you wearing a watch, Father?	Yes.  It's exactly...
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.	What time did you make it for?	Eight.  That okay?
Yes.	And how would you describe him?	Quiet.  Real quiet...	And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?	Seemed...on edge.	On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?	He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.	Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.	Just me.
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?	It's nothing.	Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.	Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.	You have to tell me who did it.
I can take care of myself.	I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.	Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.	My secretary?	You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.	No, I wasn't, actually.	You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care.  And then, minutes after they left, he suffered a stroke. He's comatose.  No brain wave activity at all.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?	Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
Your court order, Dr. Allen.	You know I'm not comfortable with this.	But your patient is legally entitled to it.	This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.	It's the patient's request, doctor.	I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.	Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.	I think I should join you.
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?	I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.	What did you hear?
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.	And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?	There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.	You heard voices, you know you did.
I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before.  Satan is not what you think he is.  Satan is not some creature.	You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.	Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.	If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?	Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions.
The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia.	He will.  He has great faith.	But bad judgement.  And now you see how dangerous the consequences can be.
Is he going to be okay?	I hope so.
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.	Father, I have nowhere else to stay.	You have a sister in New Orleans.
You'll do it?	I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.	You ready?
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.	You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.	Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith.  Where are you in death without it?
What is it?	Something he said, just before...	He spoke to you?	Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.	Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?	You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.	No matter, my son, he believes in you.	But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.	Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.	You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
You fucking bastard.	Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.	So all that bullshit about God and faith.	It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.	You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.	Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.	You raised me, like a son.	You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?	You killed my parents.	I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
Why are you doing this to me?	I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.	Just open the door, please.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.	Father, I'm right here.	...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again...
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.	Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.	"What do you mean ""don't worry?"""	Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
So...we won?	Yes.  We won, that's right.
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?	Um hm.  That's right, Maya.	So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...	Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.	Miette, come here and relax.
Father, please don't die.	...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.	Kelson, hold on a second...
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.	How many weeks are you honey/	"Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says ""Goodbye?"""	You need his blood-type.  Like right away.	Well I know he's come here before.	What's his name?	Peter...Peter Kelson.	You just call?	I didn't know what else to do...
Two negatives always make a positive.	Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
Oh my God!	...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
May I help you?	Peter Kelson?	Yes... and you are?	I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.	Thank you.  Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.	Not pure evil.  That's correct.	And also that...	Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.	"That there is no such thing as evil with a capital ""E."""	Not the most popular opinion, but yes.	What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.	And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.	Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.	I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.	In the end, the jury saw it my way.	Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?	Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?	What's that got to do with you?	Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?	I do.	An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.	I'll bet.	On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?	The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.	Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
So...what did you think of the tape.	I think you gave me the wrong one.	What do you mean?	It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
You're sure?  There was nothing?	I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
So what'd I miss?	You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?	I had to.	And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.	That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...	Well, why should I?  Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
We need to talk.	Peter, please...
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?	Please, the children.
Why did he try to kill me?	Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
And the point is?	At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.	What?!?!	It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.	Why didn't Birdson just say so?	If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.	Trick him.	The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.	You should think about getting professional help.	You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.	I'm not going to be drawn into this.	I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?	My parents are dead.  Don't even think of bringing them into this.
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.	If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
I don't understand what's going on.	There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...	But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.	You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.	Yes, I know.	The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.	So what?	Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother	Yes.
Do you know your parents' blood types?	I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.	Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.	So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.	Then why are you here?
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.	And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?	I don't know.  I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  I don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  I don't even know when it's going to happen.
"When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  ""The time of transformation is near..."""	Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
What are you looking for exactly?	The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
We needed to know all we could.	I'm going to look around.
Nothing yet.	I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
Get up!!	What's the...OH SHIT!
Peter, let go of the chair!	What?
You okay?	When's your birthday?	What?
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.	Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.	That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?	I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
There's nothing else here.	What's the bible for?	Comfort.
Are you alright?	Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.	What do you mean?	I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
I'm scared I'm slipping back.	We're going to do this.	You have to say that.	That's true.
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?	I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.	I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.	No oxygen to the brain.	Maybe that's my problem.	Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...	Until it happens, you're still a human being.	What about after?	Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
Plenty of time.	What are these?	I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?	Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.	Sure.
What can I do?	You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.	So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?	He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.	What did he say to you in French?	"That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, ""together, no matter what."""	Terrific.
He was trying to tell me something.	"And his message was  ""Together, no matter what?"""
"Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  ""But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."""	And what's that mean?
How much time do we have?	Not a lot.
Oh, Peter.	It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...
Good seeing you again.	Whish the circumstances were different.
Hello?	I know who he is.	Maya?  What do you mean?	I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
And what are you thinking we should do now?	I've filed a report with Father Frank.	A lot of good that'll do.	We need all the help we can get.	I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.	We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.	Alright, Maya.  We'll do it your way.
It's useless...look at him.	You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.	Sure of what?  Who cares if this guy is devoid of faith or sleeps over a pentacle?  Results are what Lareaux would want.
You don't want to face it.	Look, John, I'm facing it.	I'm not waiting until it's too late.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.	You are the younger of two...
But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.	Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.	Viznick will get off and Michael's got a crush on you.
You know what?  You can go.	Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.	Get out of here.	Goodbye.
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.	What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?	He can see you Thursday.	I think it's gonna be a waste of time.	The police used him as a witness in this case.	I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.	Nice suit.
I plan to.  You want a tip?	Lemme guess.  The lottery.	Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.	You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.	You watch.  One day, I'll hit the jackpot, get the big house, car, clothes.  I'll have more money than God.
Yeah.	It's Detective Smythe.
Good of you to stop by.	We millionaires yet?
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.	Thanks for having me, Sally.	Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?	Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.	It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.	"No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital ""E.""  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings."	"You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by ""demonic voices?"""	There weren't any voices.	Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?	As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.	What do you mean by that?	Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.	Are you saying he's legally sane?	Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.	Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.	Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.	And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
Would you sign it for me?	Of course.
Hey!  Mr. big shot.	Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...	Yeah, right.  I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys.  I knew you wouldn't show.
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.	Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.	Yeah, yeah.  I've heard it before.  Just be sure you spell my name right.  Nine o'clock?
What's this?	So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.	Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.	You're too old to smoke.  Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
What's the matter with you?	He's looking right at me.
He could see me.	I'll quit, maybe you should start.
Thanks for handling this.	Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
Thanks again for everything.	Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
What's up?	How're you doin' today?	It's another day.  I think I'm alright.	You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.	She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.	Parents died?	Yeah, murder-suicide.	What happened?	Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.	She told me she killed them.	Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.	Where is she now?	Had to let her go.  I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't.
Monica, what did you do?	Nothing.	Oh, all that work.
Ah, Mom.	I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
I hate it.	Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?	Pants.
nothing.	I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.	I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
That's not funny	Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...	Watch your mouth.
Taste this.	I can't eat before a game.	Child, take a bite.
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.	Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
What?	Nothing.  So good luck.
What?	Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
Monica.  What are you doing here?	Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.	Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.	Dad around?	He's still at the bank.
What?	Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
Hi.	Need any help?	I can manage.
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.	How is he?	Engaged.	To that stewardess?	Yeah, you met her?	His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.	Maybe she is.
So what do I do?	Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.	Whatever.	You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?	I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.	Don't curse.	There you go.	"What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too ""prissy"" for you, too bad."
"So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a ""dumb"" jump shot?"	You're the one always turning your nose up at me.	No I don't.	Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.	I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.	What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?	Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.	So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.	Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.	That's not it.	Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.	I don't remember that.	I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.	That's ridiculous.	What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.	You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.	It mattered, Mom.
What are you talking about?	When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.	She's alright.	How is she alright looking the way she does?	Camille, she'll be fine.
Which one for tomorrow?	The blue.	You sure?
Okay.	Thanks, sweetheart.
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?	Are you okay?	I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day.
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.	But you use potato?
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?	What'd you do?
So you're still breast-feeding?	The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.	He's fine.	Okay.
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...	Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.	Okay?
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.	It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.	You're a caterer?	Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do.  Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.	Really?  Well, come on, then.
I can take it.	This time get your feet set.
What?	You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
Coach...	I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.	Thanks.	We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.	I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.	You want the job or not?
What?	It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.	You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential?   When I ignore you, that's when you worry.  Go get dressed.
Can I take your coat?	You're cold?
No, I mean I can check it for you.	Oh, sorry.
I'm an English major.  You like English?	Sort of.	Careful.	Huh?	That was two words.
Sorry.	I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
My mouth is kinda dry.	Then I'll get you some punch.
That was nice.	Uh-huh.	Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself...
Wait...	Shh.  It's okay.
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.	Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.	You could make a career by telling me where.	Gotta wait til the press conference.	But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.	I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.	It's okay.	Why are you up?  Get in bed.
Hello.	Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...	Monica.  You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you.
It means a lot that you came by.	Yes, we appreciate that.
Damn, girl.	What?	I don't wanna see that.	Get used to it, babe.
So how long is this trip?	Four days.
Nah.	Why not?	You might be the only one with a job.	Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.	Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?	To do what you love.	I don't know sometimes.	You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.	A horse?	Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
That too tight?	No.	Mom's going to hate it.	Always on my ass, anyway.	Like you don't give her a hard time.	Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.	No one's forcing her.	Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?	Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.	I found you someone.	Found?  I'm not some charity case.	I know...	Mom tell you to do this?	No.	Damn, Lena...  Who is he?	This brother from my college.	He's in college?	And he's fine, girl.	How'd you get him to say yes?	I told him you looked like me.	Oh, great.	You do.	Yeah, right.	If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
I don't know how to walk in heels.	Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
You ever been in love?	Too many times.	They ever love you back?	Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.	And what am I supposed to say to the man?	The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.	You lost your head.	I was just showing emotion.
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.	What?	You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.	The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.	I know.  But chances are...	Chances are there's still a chance.
Hey, munchkin.	Dad.  What are you doing here?	I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.	That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.	So how's the job going?
You shoot like a girl.	I'll take that as a compliment.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?	She hates all freshmen.
What's up with that?	Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?	Thanks, Sidra.	Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.	I was just playing ball.	You were trying to make me look bad.	Didn't have to try very hard.
What's up?	Just wanted to say good game.	But?	No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.	Thanks.	But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
I know.	Just one word of advice for next season.	What's that?	Never let a freshman take your spot.
Well, what do you know.	What's up, Sidra.	I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.	"How do you say ""you're dreaming"" in Italian?"
Can you take that damn thing off the table.	You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.	Just like that?	Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.	How's that been?	"It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad ""The American"" was making more money.  I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball."
So what are these Spanish guys like?	I wouldn't know.	What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?	Just not my type, I guess.	Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women.  They can't get enough of me.
You ever think about going back?	Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
One, up.	Lucky.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.	I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
So...does it hurt?	It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.	For real?	Uh huh.
So how come you could play basketball?	I just can.	I never knew a girl that could play.	My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.	Your Dad play?	He works at a bank.	"My Dad plays for the ""Clippers.""  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything."	I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.	He's alright, but my Dad can take him.	What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?	I don't know.  A lot.	One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.	You do act different.	I don't care.	Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.	I'd just tell my sister, Lena.	She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
What do I have to do?	I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.	I don't like flowers.	Oh.	How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.	Kay.	Okay.
I think we gotta kiss now.	For how long?	Five seconds.
I want to ride my own bike.	My Dad always drives my Mom.	So?	So that means I have to ride with you.
I don't have to do what you say.	Man, forget you then, stupid.	You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
What?	Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.	Shut up!
Way to hoop.	I know this.  What do you want?	A ride home.	Your legs don't look broke.	Look, big head, I'll be at your car.	"Guess ""please"" would be a stretch."	Please.
What's that?	Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.	Big-ass titties?
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.	She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.	And?	"And?  She's not saying, ""I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better,"" she's saying, ""I wanna bone."""	So she's honest.	Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.	Didn't know you cared so much.	I don't.	So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?	Who's Spalding?
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.	Who said I'm not getting recruited?	Your hot-ass temper.
I'm not the one who put this scar here.	God, here we go.	When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
That's it, give it your best shot.	Would you watch the damn road?	I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.	I'm warning you, don't tempt me.	I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
"Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a ""lady"".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player."	With a jacked-up attitude.	Didn't know you cared so much.	I don't.	Good.
See you made it.	Yeah.	You don't look half-bad.	You either.
Hey.	Hey.	You having fun?	Yeah.	Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?	He ain't Spalding.	Guess not.	So you took Shawnee, huh?
Early night for you, isn't it?	I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
Mulholland Drive.	Figures.	So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?	None of your business.	Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.	That what you think?
Why?	Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
Four.	What?	You had four offensive rebounds.
When'd you get this?	It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?	You sure?
What was that about?	I know, right?
You finish the reading for E-con?	Yeah.	What'd it say?	Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.	Whatever, big head.
What?	You do see me standing here, right?	I can't be nice to a fan?	Fine, Quincy.	I can't help girls coming up to me.	I said fine.
It's okay, little baby.	Quit.
Forget Tonya Randall.	I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.	Then prove her wrong.	I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.	So you're gonna act salty all night?
That was so weak.	Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
So how about a little one-on-one?	What are we playing for?	Clothes.	What?
Give me the ball.	My court, I go first.
Kiss my booty.	Plan to.
"Yo, where's the ""D""?"	Right here.
I won.	I wanted you to.
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...	I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.	What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...	She understands.	"He even had me wanting to play for the ""Clippers.""  Man, how stupid am I."	You're not stupid.	I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?	I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?	I...can't.	Why not?	Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.	I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.	Nah.  Don't sweat it.	Quincy...	For real.  I should be alone, anyway.
Hey.	What's up?	I've been trying to find you all day.	Here I am.
Sorry about your game.	It happens, right...
he's just playing, Q...	You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
Who was that?	Nobody.	Who's nobody?	Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?	You want to go talk?	Not really.
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.	Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.	Nah.  I have curfew.
Hey.	Hey, what's up.	You weren't at my game.	Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.	"The ""man"" again."	Woman...
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.	What the hell's going on?	We're going to get some food.	Are you out of your mind?
Can we talk?	Talk to your new girlfriend.	I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.	Cheap date.	Least she had time for me.	So you fucked around to prove a point!	I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.	"What, ""Q-man"", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?"	You forgot to be there.	That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?	Stay!	If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!	Least you got your priorities straight.	I never asked you to choose.	Never had to.	I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.	Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale.
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.	I'm not asking for us to be together.
What?	I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.	How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.	I don't think so.	You don't think so?	Look, I'm entering the draft.	You're what?	I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
When did you decide all this?	Few days ago.	So that's it, just forget about us?	Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
So...I guess I'll see you around.	Uh huh.
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.	I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
Just something I'm trying.	No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.	Thanks.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...	I'm alright.  But you can sit.	I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.	Yup.	What are the doctors saying?	A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.	I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.	Not for Quincy McCall.	"I forgot, ""Q-man."""
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?	We won the championship.	Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?	Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.	Funny.  I never did.	Kiss my ass.
Tried calling you a couple times.	Oh yeah?	Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.	Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.	Figured it was something like that.
Actually, I don't...	What do you mean?	I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.	A rest?	Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?	No.
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.	Thanks.
You visiting?	Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.	Who's this guy I always see her around?	Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.	So...how's the knee?	Getting there.	Strong enough to get you down the aisle?	Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...	That's okay.  I'm probably, you know, busy.
It just isn't.	Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.	You had a rough couple years, that's all.	That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?	And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.	Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...	You're serious.	Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.	Like what?	Maybe go back to school.	Wow.
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.	It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.	So why'd you give up ball?	Why do you keep asking me that?	Cause I don't get it.	Something was just missing.	What?
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.	Find.
What's going on?	We need to talk.
You asked me what was missing.	What?	From basketball.	you woke me up to tell me that?	It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
I heard enough.	What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.	We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?	I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.	Then why are you so upset?	Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.	Better late than never, right?	Wrong.
I'll play you.	What?	One game.  One-on-one.	For what?	Your heart.
You're out of your mind.	So you're gonna bitch up?	What's that supposed to be, psychology?	I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.	Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on.
What will this prove?	You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.	So?	So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.	And what happens when you lose?	If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
Hey, girl.	Hey.	Your hair looks so cute like that.
No.	C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?	There's so many I just can't keep track.	Well, can you give him this for me?
Give it yourself.	I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
Zeke.	"What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say ""shit."""
We should head over.	Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.	With who?	Business folks.	You just got back from a four game road trip.	Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
I had some players to see and hands to shake.	At one in the morning?	I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.	I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
Yeah.	I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...	I have.
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.	"No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my ""bullshit"" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold."
Fine, then how many nights home is that?	Keep your voice down.
Not great.	What's that, not great?	The doctor'll be back in a minute.	Nona, please.	He tore his ACL.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?	Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
What?	We still have to go?	Yeah.
What is this?	Uh, your earring?	I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.	What are you doing in my room?
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.	We were just studying.	I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.	Okay.	You hearing me?	I've been hearing you.
How was your game?	Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.	Still the man.	Yup.
Where's your dad?	Said he'd be home later.	Later when?	I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
You scared me.	Sorry.  You okay?	I'm fine.
Guess he talked to you.	Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.	Whose truth are you talking about?	Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
Just...leave it alone.	This is just about money, you know that.	Quincy, please...	I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?	Guess I should have been telling your father.	So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?	"""Can't"" should never be in a man's vocabulary."	Why not?	Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.	That's right.
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.	I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.	Didn't we already have this conversation?
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?	I don't wanna hurt your feelings.	You don't wanna hurt your back.	Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.	You work too hard, Pop.	Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
What people?	You know, people.	Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.	I'm also good enough to go pro.	You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.	You came out early.	Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.	Okay...
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.	What mess?	there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.	What?	Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.	Tell me what?	I just told you.	I mean, it's not true, is it?
Sorry.	No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
So what are you gonna do?	I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.	Why?	"A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the ""Clips.""  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me."	What's Mom think?	We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
What are you doing here?	Your door was unlocked.	Still is, so let yourself out.	We need to talk.	We ain't got nothing to talk about.	I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.	Lucky kid.	Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.	And some things should never fucking happen!	Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?	I ain't a damn liar.	Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.	So now you're saying my mother trapped you?	I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.	What?
From your mouth.	I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.	"Always thought ""can't"" wasn't in a man's vocabulary."
What do you want?	Came by to check on you.	After five years.	Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.	Look, I'm busy.	I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.	I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?	No.	Good.	Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.	"And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  ""I told you so?"""	You want me to fuck off?	Yeah.	Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
What surery?	Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.
Your teeth are straight.	I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.	Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --	I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.	How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?	I don't know.
No need for braces, Donnie.	THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.	HEY FUCK YOU DON WATCH IT NOW.
You smell like trouble --	I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.	You ok?	ooohhhhhh no.
It's been the same fuckin' thing for thirty years, Burt --	These adults are tough enough, I think you'll be surprised -- the Mexican's a bit of a question mark --
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?	"And the book says: ""We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."""	C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --	In my sleep, Burt.
Call 911. Call 911 right now.	No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --	no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.	I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.	Call 911, Mary, do it right now.	You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --	Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --	Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.	What's wrong?	Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --	-- no,no,no what is this? who? What's this guy's name?
Hello?	Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --	Hello, Phil.
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?	It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?	Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?	I'm really only equipped to take orders --	Well can you connect me to someone else?	Well what's the situation?	Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?	I'm here, I'm listening.	OK.  See:  Frank TJ Macky is Earl Partridge's son....
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.	I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --	Uh-huh.	Does this sound weird?	Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.	There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.	What kind of Cancer?	Brain and Lung.	My mother had breast cancer.	It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?	Oh, she's fine.	Oh that's good.	It was scary though.	It's a helluva disease.	Sure is.  So why call me?
Yeah, hey. Chad.	Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --	Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --	Thank you.  Thank you very much.
...what the fuck is this...?	It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
What do you want? Why are you here?	I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --	He's not my boyfriend.
Wanna call me a slut now, something?	No.  No.
What the fuck do you want?	I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.	Don't sit down.	...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --	I don't wanna talk to you.	Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --	Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?	I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --	Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?	Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --	I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.	I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --	I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --	I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.	Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --	Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --	GET THE FUCK OUT.	I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --	FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.	I'm not lying to you, I'm not --	FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.	baby, please, please --	I'M NOT YOUR BABY, I'M NOT YOUR GIRL. I'm not your fuckin' baby --
Please put your clothes on, please --	YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.	Honey.	GET OUT.
Your mother wants to hear from you --	GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
...Hello...?	LAPD. Open the door.
uh...uh...What is it?	It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?
OPEN THE DOOR.	I'm coming!
...yeah...	I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.
Yes.	No one else in there with you?
For what?	Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?	I'm sorry.
Wilson.	Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?	What?	Did you hear what I said?	Yeah, but I don't know --	-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?	No.	Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.	I didn't realize it was that loud.	And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?	Yeah.	You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
No.	I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?	Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.	Was it a boyfriend of yours?	No.	You don't have a boyfriend?	No.	Who was it?	I was...he's gone...I mean it's not. It's over, y'know --
You mind if I check things back here?	It's fine.
What are you lookin' for?	Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?	ok.	You just move in here?	About two years ago.	Bit messy.	Yeah.	I'm a bit of a slob myself.	Yeah.	You and your boyfriend have a party last night?	I don't have a boyfriend.
got some coffee brewing, huh?	Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --	I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --	-- do you wanna cup?	That's great, thank you.
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --	Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia.	You take cream or sugar?	That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?	Yeah.	Arlight, then.  Cheers.
Is this boyfriend bothering you?	I don't have a boyfriend.	The gentleman who came to the door --	-- is not my boyfriend.	Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --	It's not -- what's a 422?	It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --	It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.	I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.	You won't.  You won't have to.	But I wouldn't mind comin' back in an hour just to see your pretty face!
I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.	Okey-doke.
Ok, ok. I'm back.	This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --	Thank you.
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.	What's that stand for?	Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
This is my job.	We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.	Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --	If you're not here for a 422 --	No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.	I'm sorry.	Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?	Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.	Just Jim.	yeah, good, ok.	Bye, bye, Claudia.	Good bye.
I'm sorry, Claudia.	What is it?  Did you forget something?	No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.	You wanna go on a date with me?	Please, yes.	Well...is that illegal?	No.	Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?	I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.	Really?	Yeah.	I thought you were flirting with me a little.
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?	No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?	Eight o'clock?	What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --	Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?	No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --	Billingsley's?	Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?	It's my favorite place --	Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.	Great, bye.	Bye.
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --	Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --	So you've done it --	Well I don't go out very much.	Why not?	I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.	And I bet you say that to all the girls --	No, no.	You wanna make a deal with me?	ok.	What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...	...yeah...	To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --	Let's make a deal.	Ok.  I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
"Wow....huh...""...piss and shit..."""	What?	You really use strong language.	I'm sorry --	-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.	I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --	It's fine.	I'm sorry.	...nothing.  I'm sorry...	No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --	-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --	I'm sorry.	I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --	ok.	ok.
Well.	That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.	Yeah.	Can I tell you something?	Yeah, of course.	I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --	-- no, like what, what do you mean?	You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.	I lost my gun.	What?	I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.

You look like you've got money in your pocket.	Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.	This sounds threatening.	Do you have love in your heart?	I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.	Is it real love?	Well --	-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?	Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.	I have love.	A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.	No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.	And I'm listening avidly, fellow.	My name is Donnie Smith and I have lot's of love to give.
....do you know who I am?	You're a friend of the family I presume?	What?  What does that mean?	Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.	You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --	Might of been before my time.
But you're alright now, so what's the what?	What?	That's right.	I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.	Brad, dear?

"It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella ""Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."""	"""The"" cause of dullness in others --"	Picky, picky.	"-- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- ""A man of genius"" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for ""ruined but by himself,"" not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --"
Things go round 'n round, don't they?	Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.	This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.	I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.	Shall we drink to that?

...please...	Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.	Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.	Solomon: I am in the middle of so much. So much in my life and this is -- If you do this, if you fire me: I Am Fucked. I can't really explain much, but please, please, I've worked here for four years, four years I've given you and I'm, I'm, I mean what?  I'm sorry I was late. I had a car accident.  I accidentaly drove into a seven-eleven. It was not my fault.
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --	-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --	I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --	FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --	I paid you back.	Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --	Solomon, please.  Please.  I am so fucked here if you do this.  This is the worst timing. The worst timing I could ever imagine. I need to keep working.  I have so many debts, so many things, I have, I have, I have -- I have surgery -- I have my oral surgery coming --
What is that?	Braces.	Braces?	Yes.	You don't need braces.	Yes I do.	Your teeth are fine.
And how much is braces?	It's...doesn't matter....
I've been a good worker --	Don't do this, Don.
I don't know.	You were gonna ask me weren't you?	I've been a good worker, Solomon. A hard and loyal --
Give me your keys, Don.	PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!	GIMME YOUR FUCKIN' KEYS.
-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?	I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?	I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?	Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --	He has Phil right now.	Phil's one of the nurses from the service?	Yeah.	If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --	-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --	We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?	I'm listening.  I'm getting better.	Do you wanna sit down?	I need to sit down.	Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --	-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --	The job here is to make him as comfortable as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible. Right?  You understand?
How's today then?	Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.	Fuckin' bullshit is right, in'it?
...no...no goddamn use.  I have a son, y'know?	You do?	...ah...	Where is he?	I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?	No.	Get a girlfriend.	I'm trying.	And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?	She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.	She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.	She loves you.	...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...	When was the last time you talked to your son?	....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --	-- memory?	Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?	Yeah.	"""yeah.""  the fuck do you know?"	I've seen it before.	Other fuckin' assholes like me.	There's no asshole like you.	...cocksucker....	"How come every word you say is either ""cocksucker,"" or ""shitballs,"" or ""fuck?"""	Do me a personal favor --	Go fuck myself?	You got it.
...I can't hold onto this anymore...	I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --	...gimme that fuckin' phone...	Who are you gonna call?	I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?	Who?	Jack.	Is Jack your son?
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --	-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:	It's ok.
...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey --	Frank Mackey.  That's your son?	that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that, give it --
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?	No.	...Lily...?	No.	"She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, ""What's that girl?""  ""How's that Lily?"" ""Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys...""  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?"	Graduation?	No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?	Twelve.

I couldn't get over that I wasn't a man, but she was a woman. Y'see?  Y'see I didn't make her feel ok about that....I would say, ""How many men you been with?"" She told me, I couldn't take it...take that I wasn't a man....because if I hadn't had sex with women...like as many women as she had men...then I was weak...a boy.... But I loved her...you understand? ....well, of course, I wanted to have sex with her...and I did and we were together....we met...age twelve, but then again...age seventeen...something, somethin...

Hello?	Hi.  Is Frank there?	I think you have the wrong number.	I'm looking for Frank Mackey.	No.	Is this 509-9027?	Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.	Alright.  Thank you.	Yep.
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.	Are we gonna tape some stuff now?	If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --	You got us a room so quick?
All it takes is one second?	Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.	I'm gonna start rolling --	"-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, ""Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me.""  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?"	Ok.  So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start --
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --	Like I said, yeah --
"-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The ""listener-patient""  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical ""get my dick hard and fuck it"" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --"	Let's talk about --	I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.	It's fine.  I can bleep it out.	I warned you -- I get on a roll...	-- let's talk more about your background --	Muffy -- coffee?
I'm confused about your past is the thing.	Is that still lingering?	-- just to clarify --	So boring, so useless --	I would just want to clear some things up:	"Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, ""Seduce and Destory:"" ""Facing the past is an important way in not making progress,"" that's something I tell my men over and over --"	This isn't meant --	-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?	Are you asking me that?	Yes.	Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --	In aid of what?	I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --	-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --	It's all important --	Not really.	It's not like I'm trying to attack you --	"This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- ""The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me,"" Chapter Three --"	We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --	I'm not sure I hear a question in there?	Do you remember a Miss Simms?	I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.	She does.  From when you were a boy.	Mm. Hm.	She lived in Tarzana.	"An old stomping ground --is this the ""attack"" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is ""the girl"" coming in for the kill?"	No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --	Go ahead and waste your time.	I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --	And that's what you've heard?	I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?	What am I doing?	Yeah.	I'm quietly judging you.
Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.	So you sat it out, that's what you did?	"You requested my time and I gave it you, you called me a liar and made accusations. And you say, ""If I'd known I wouldn't have asked,"" then it's not an attack?  Well, I don't wanna be the sort of fella who doesn't keep his word.  I gave you my time, Bitch. So fuck you now."
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --	-- fuck you.
Where are you from originally?	Around here.	the valley?	Hollywood, mainly.	And what did your parents do?	My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.	Why does that sound silly?	Well I guess it doesn't.	Does you mother still work?	She's retired.	Are you close?	She's my mother.	"What does she say about, ""Seduce and Destroy."""	"""Go Get 'Em, Honey."""	And your father?	He passed away.	I'm sorry.	people die.	I wouldn'tve asked --	Not a problem.	And you ended up at UC Berkely --	From '84 to '89.	Psychology major?	Right.	Do you have your masters?	...this close...	In five years?
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?	I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.	Where does that name come from?	What name?  My name?	It's not your given name, right?	My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.	"And ""Frank?"""	"""Frank"" was my mother's father."	Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --	Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --	They wouldn't?	no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?	Kind of.	"I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in ""Seduce,"" And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he."
Are you asking me a question?	Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.	...are you Phil...?	Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.	I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?	Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --	Is Linda here?	She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?	Yeah let's...maybe just stand.	These Dogs'll calm down -- you just have to come in --
He's in here.	Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?	Ok.
How long have you taken care of him?	For six months.  I'm the day nurse...	Uh-huh.  What's going on?	He's...I'm sorry...so sorry...I've seen this before, you know and you don't.... He's going very fast....Frank...um....	Is he in pain?	I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?	...uh-huh...
How long...you think?	Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...	When did he go off chemo?	About three weeks ago.	.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --	I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --	Uh. huh.	I'm really sorry.	He's in here --?	Yeah.
I've heard your tapes on the phone.	Oh yeah.	When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....	Uh. huh.	It's interesting.	Mmm.
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:	...ok...	Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...	yeah.
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?	I don't think, he can't...	...just wait...Dad...you want something...can you say...
What? What? What now?	Quietly, slow down, whoa --	You can't just come in here.	The door was open, I got a call --	You're just come in --	Calm down.	I am calm.	I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --	There's no disturbance.	I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --	There's no disturbance.	Then you've got nothin' to worry about.	You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --	Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.	I AM CALM.	You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?	I don't have to answer your questions.	No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?	What does it look like?	No one else in here?	You're here.	OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?	No.  I said that.	Are you lyin' to me?	I live alone.	Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?	No I Said.	Ok. What's your name?	Marcie.	Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?	I preffer to stand.	I'm not askin', Marcie.
I didn't do anything.	Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.	I don't know a loud crash.	And what about screaming?	I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --	What's this, how did this happen?
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?	I went out last night.	Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.	It's a free country, you can think anything you want.	Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.	Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?	Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?	No.	You on any medication?	No.	Been drinkin' today?	It's ten o'clock in the morning --
--- What was that?	I didn't hear anything.
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --	I don't have to do a god damn thing.
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --	Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --	THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --	THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!	Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --	THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.	-- do not do this -- my gun is drawn and If I Have To Open That Closet you will get shot -- Step Out Now.
What the hell is this Marcie?	THAT'S NOT MINE.
You look great.	What the fuck is this, Jimmy?	...you know...	Did your wife find out?	No.	Then what?	It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --	-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.	I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.
Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --	All your other fluzzies?	Yeah. Yes.	You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.	Are you gonna tell her what you've done?	Yes.	Will you say my name?	If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.	Well can you do me one favor and don't do that.
Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --	I won't.	What happend to you?	I got in trouble at school.
Are you ok?	Fuck no.
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --	Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?	I'm sorry.	I need you to get me Paula --	You want her right now?	Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --	We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.	Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
I can't fuckin' do this.	Are you alright?	Fuck.  I think I'm gonna throw up, I think.  I haven't thrown up since I was twenty years old.
Willa Cather.	"For 25.  Best known for the ""tragedy and blood"" genre, this author-playwright --"
I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley.	Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.
What were you saying, Stanley?	I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.	I'm sorry, Stanley.
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.	It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
How you doing?	I'm drinking.	Slowly or quickly?	As fast as I can.	Come home soon after the show.	I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --	-- did she talk to you?	She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.	Did you tell her?	I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --	I love you.	Love you too..	Bye.
I don't think I want that.	It'll take the pain away.	It's not really pain.
How do we do this, then?	We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...	Do you love me, Rose?
You're my handsome man.	I'm a bad person.	No.  No.	No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....	You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --	--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?	Yeah.	The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?	Will that help?	Yeah.
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...	I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.	I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....	I'll answer anything.	Was there anyone that I know?	Yes.	Who?	Rose, I don't --	hey.	Paula.  Ellen.
That's it.	No one else that I know?	No.	How long with Ellen?	Just once.	How long with Paula?	Two years...three years...	What about now?	It's over.  I talked to her this morning.	Is it over 'cause you're sick?	It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.	Do you have any children with anyone?	What? No, Rose, jesus, no --	Well maybe.	I don't.	Do you feel better now that you've said this?	I don't know....	I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?	I love you so much.	I'm not through asking my questions.
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?	Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?	I think that you know.	Maybe...I don't...
...say it, Jimmy...	Do you know the answer to this?	I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.	I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
"She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, ""You touched me wrong..."" ""I know that."" Some crazy thought in her, in her head..."	Did you ever touch her?	...No....
Jimmy, did you touch her?	I don't know.
...Jimmy...	I really don't know.	But you can't say....	<u>I don't know what I've done</u>.	Yes you do....you do and you won't say.	...I don't know...
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.	I don't know what I've done.	Yes you do.	Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?	No.	I don't know what I've done.	You should know better.
Hello?	Hello.  Is Claudia here?	She's asleep.	Are you her boyfriend?	You're Jimmy Gator, right?	Yes.  What's your name?	I'm Bob.	You're her boyfriend?	No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?	I'm her father.
Can I come in?	Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
Want me to wake her up?	I'II go....is it...back here?
I'm sorry.	It's alright.
Do you still have to do homework?	Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
Was it a call back?	No.  But I probably will get a call back.	If we beat the record, you might get a call back --	I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.	Saucy-saucy.
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.	When they want us done, they'll call in the Harvard S.W.A.T team or some shit.
Do you have an agent, Stanley?	No.	You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --	Like what?
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.	What's MOW?	Movie Of The Week.  I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --
They look pretty smart, I think.	No they don't --
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.	I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
You don't want any water?	No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --	Are you on drugs right now?	If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?	Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --	Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --	Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --	-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---	You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.	No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl.  When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand?  I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...  I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.	What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --	This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..	Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.	I can't.	You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.	Where will the money go?	Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --	What does that mean?	The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --	-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.	-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.	This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.	Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --	Shut the fuck up.	I'm trying to help, Linda --	Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.	You need to sober up.	Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.	Linda --	I have to go.
Let me call you a car, Linda.	Shut the fuck up.
Linda --	What are you doing?	I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --	Hang up the phone.	No, Linda, you don't understan --	PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?	Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --	BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT HE DIDN'T ASK YOU, HE DOESN'T WANT HIM, HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM, SO FUCK YOU THAT HE ASKED THAT. THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME AND HIM.
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...	....it's alright....	Tell him I'm sorry, ok, yes, you do that, now, I'm sorry, tell him, for all the things I've done...I fucked up and I'm sorry.... And I'm Gonna Turn Away And Walk Now And Not Look At Him Not See My Man, My Earl, I'll leave now...and tell him it's ok and I'm ok. The whole thing was ok with me -- and I know.

I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.

M'lady...?	I understand you saved my son's life today.	God smiled upon us.	And you were not hurt?	No, M'lady.	That is good.
Oh God I -- Forgive me...	M'lady...?

M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...	If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.	I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?	Nothing... Nothing.
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.	Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
My Queen...	D'Artagnan.
I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.	We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.	I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.	Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more.  But that one, it was enough.  Enough to make me love you forever.  I want you to remember that... and go on.  As strong as you are now.  No matter what happens.
Mother -- ?	May I speak with you?  Alone?	I am preparing for a ball!	We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
What is it, mother?	I wish to discuss your brother.	He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.	First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.	I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.	He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.	Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!	Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.	You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!	Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
Louis, please -- !	My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
What had you to do with this, Mother?	He is your brother!	He is nothing now.
D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.	No, Louis!  No!	Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!!
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?	Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.	Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.	I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.	How can I serve you in this?	Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?	If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.	Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
Your Majesty...	How goes that favor I asked of you?	I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.	You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
Wh-- Wha--	Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.	Phillippe?!  Why do you call me --
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!	Shut up, knave!
And some problems cannot be settled without one.	Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
What do you propose to do?	Replace the king.
It can.  I know the way.	I am with you!
What are they doing?	Making the key to the throne.
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?	Soon enough.  Here we are.
The Prison of Belle Sur.	Come, we have a boat waiting.
What is that?	A body.	I see that is a body!  But where did you get it?
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.	Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.	His plight is obvious, isn't it?
Who is he, Aramis?	Tomorrow.	Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!	You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.	You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.	You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.	He who is not with us is against us.	Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.	Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!	There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!	I have it all worked out.	Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --	Those can be adopted --	And people close to him, who --	Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!	It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!	Yes, and he has a choice!
How is he?	Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --	More wine!!	You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --	You can do it.	In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --	Three days.	Three days??!!	The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball.  It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one.  At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then?  Remember France.  Remember the poor. Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where are those serving girls...?
Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --	You grow fond of him.  That's good.	Don't play God with me, Aramis I --
Go on.	But -- what is Porthos doing?	Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
Now.  You were saying?	But -- what is he doing?	About to hang himself, I should think.
Hang himself?!	He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.	We must stop him!	Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.	But -- but --
Poor Phillippe!	The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?	All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
Where are you going?!	Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.	But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --	He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.	What you're asking is impossible!	I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.	But --	You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King.  So do it.
Aramis, this will never --	Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.	But --	It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.	Hold your goblet with two fingers.
Bloody hell...	We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
He seeks redemption.	You're a fool!	Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.	So what has changed?	Perhaps he serves a different king.
Then to the Bastille.	To the Bastille.  And death.
A simple theological discussion.	Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.	Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem.
Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.	We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
No!  Stop --	I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.	You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king!  I have sworn to him!
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.	The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.	I know.  God go with you.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.	You can't do it.	Pull them back!	Everyone back.	Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.	They will know you helped us, if we go this way.	That doesn't matter now.
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?	I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --	Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?	I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.	There are more important things than tits.	Really?  If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral.
Forgiveness.	Forgiveness?
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.	Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
Aramis... is this the way to hell?	Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
Where are we?	Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
Mother of God!	It is also a place of burial.	A tomb?  We're in a tomb?	Catacombs.  Very holy.
But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?	So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?	It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.	Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
And why are you so glum?	I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...	I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.	I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?	But I was on duty...
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --	Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.	The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!	No, not Louis!	Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --	I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!	But why?	Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.	Well... Well... Okay.
Coming?	What use am I?	We go someplace dangerous.	Why didn't you say so?
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!	Come on...
Aramis... These are... these are whores!	So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.	Did she have tits like that?
He's going to kill you, Aramis.	Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.	Who?	The Queen Mother.  Anne.
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.	We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.	Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.	He is right, d'Artagnan.
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.	Who does?	Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even talk about it.
What do we do now?	I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
D'Artagnan, unready?	At a ball, everyone watches the King!
"""Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."""	He lures us to capture.
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.	You are right.  But it is a trap.	So what?  I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss.
It worked!	It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!
Do I look all right?	None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.	I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...	Perhaps this will help.
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.	She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!	Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
But -- are you sure?	We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.	Michelle cannot possibly accept!	She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.	Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?	Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.	Die?  What...?	I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.	Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.	It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.	Raoul, no... You cannot do this.  No matter how your heart is broken --
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.	Raoul --
D'Artagnan!	Athos, my friend!
It's been too long.	Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
Thanks, but not for me.	You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?	I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.	Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?	They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.	Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?	I heard your playing.	I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!	If the young woman truly loves Raoul --	She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a poor family.  You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but I am old and hard and I've seen too much.  Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love!
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.	I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.	What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --	I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.	Raoul is everything to me.	I know.	Oh my friend.
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.	You trust his character more than anyone else does.	Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.	Save my son, d'Artagnan.
Athos, please...!	Get out of my way.	Athos, I beg you --
Where are you going?	To kill the king.
Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.	The King killed my son!	The cannons killed Raoul!  The cannons, and love.  But not the King.
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!	An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!	Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!	No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.	I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
He lies.  He is here to trap us.	I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
Recent hours have been a shock.	Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...	Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.	There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?	The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.	What is its antidote?	I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?	It is something I have done -- or did not do.	What is that?	I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.	I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --	No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!	Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?	How did you know -- ?	Porthos told me.
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.	Whose rooms are those?	Your mother's.
The room of the King's favorite mistress?	She will be at the ball.
Phillippe...?	How did you --
One for all.  All for one.	If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.	D'Artagnan...
Are you hungry?	Just... water.
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.	Who came?	"A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, ""What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?""  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting."	And you never knew why?
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.	Phillippe.  Rest now.
Your Majesty...	What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.	I decided it this morning.	Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --	I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!	But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --	Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!	It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.	I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.	Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.	A personal nature?	Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
Betrothed?  I think not.	In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.	Your Majesty has had many women --	That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!	It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?	What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.	There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.	You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!	Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --	That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!	At least help Raoul.	Silence!  I order you!	Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!	I will consider it.  Now leave me.	Thank you, your Majesty.
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?	It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --	You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
Your Majesty...?	... tired.  Must... lie down.
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!	It shall be done, your Majesty.	Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!	Yes, your Majesty.
I was told this impostor was dead!	... You knew you had a double?	He is my brother.
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --	My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.	Get out of my way.	Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.	Forgive?!	Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.	They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
Where is Michelle?	There.
Continue.	Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.	... The ball... Continue.	I must insist, Sire.
Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.	No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
Phillippe!	I am unhurt --
You dead yet?	No, Keeper.
Food, moron.	Thank you, Keeper.
What number did you tear out?	Eh?	What number, on the first page?	... Two-thirty-seven.	"Two-thirty-seven:  ""... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."""
You've... memorized...?	What was the end page?
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --	Yes, yes, go on.	Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.
Did they kill him?	No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?	... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.	You may go, Lieutenant.
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?	Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?	Out directing the search for the traitors.	When he returns, watch him.  When he leaves again, you tell me.
Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!	The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
Magnificent valor...	Shoot them!  Shoot them!
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?	Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.	Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --	Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?	That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.	Exactly why it should be given away.	What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.	Sire, I --	You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
Sire!  I -- How did you --	How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?	... Nothing.	A letter.  May I see?
From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.	Raoul... is in love...	Enough of this, our dinner waits.
The food doesn't please you?	It's lovely.  It's just...	This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.	I... we are humble people...	Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.	You would do that, your Majesty?	My dear, I've already done it.
You are beautiful.  You know you are.	Sire, I --	If you don't want to be so appealing, why did you touch the rose to your skin?  Where was it? Here?
Shall I leave?	No, you may wait behind the screen.
Did you know... about Raoul?	I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.	Oh Louis, Louis...
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...	Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --	We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.
Captain Doyle?	Yeah?
What can I do for you?	Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.	Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.	We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.	I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.	Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?	Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.	If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!	That's the point.  He slipped up, and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.
I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.	Cooperate?	Every step of the way.	If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.	Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
You mind if I ride with you?	Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
It's Marvosa -	What do you need?	The shit just hit the fan, brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.	So what?	So what is they have enough to shut us down!	You mean shut your ass down!	No I mean ours, motherfucker! If I go down everyone's going with me - you and your crew especially! You won't get protection, you won't get the trucks - nothing!
Yeah?	Where are you?	We're by Ozone...	You set to go -	What do you think?	Alright, stay on the phone.
Bullshit...	Did you report it stolen?
You can cut the shit, asshole--	we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
What the hell happened?	He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -	Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!	It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!	Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
What the hell is this Marvosa!!	He must have got the keys... off Stanton.	Great. Well that changes a lot...
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.	We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon, let's do a sweep of the alleys -
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!	Don't worry -
Did you hit him?	I didn't hit shit!
What did the six-toes have to say?	Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.	So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.	But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?	I don't know, shit.  Maybe she was looking for love...
Find out for me.	Fine...
Let's roll -	Right behind you.
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.	These crowds are going to make it a bitch!	I'm sure you can handle it.  Now I want to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from Marine to 30th.  Foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.
I'll take the south end -	Fine -
What's this?	Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
What?	When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...	Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?	Did you start out area six?	Yeah...
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -	Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.	Well don't you think that's odd?	What?
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?	Gotta come from somewhere...	Where do you come from, Marvosa?
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.	Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?	That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
Something wrong with you Marvosa?	It's just...catching up with me, you know?	Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest...you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
Alright, where is she?	And who are you?	Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!	I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
"Anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone. But--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer."	She stole my car!!
So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.	I didn't break in - the back door was open!	Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
Are you alright?	I'll live...
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...	It wasn't in the cards.
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...	And he took a swing at you?	Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...	Did he harm the girl?	Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.	Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!	Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
I was just having a little fun -	And what did he do to the girl?	Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
Zydowski.  It's about time.	You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.	Yeah?	Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.	What?  Wait a minute -	That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.	That's great Zydowski, you tech guys are really on the ball.  Harding - call the print lab at the FBI, run the prints through their library, see if it's less screwed-up than ours...
Did you read today's paper?	No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.	Well read this -
Something I don't already know?	Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?	Could explain why Fleming was there.
And where the hell is Marvosa?	He said he was following up some lead.	Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.	Who is it?	I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
Where is he?!!	I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
Speak of the devil.	They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.	Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
Captain?	Yeah?	LAPD data center reports a breach on the system.  An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton...and yours too, Marvosa.
So where are you from?	Up north.	Where up north?	Seattle.	You got any family?
No...	You're the mysterious type, right?
Mind if I turn out the light?	No...
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?	Figure you would have tried it already.
You always carry a gun with you?	No.	Only on dates?
What's going on here?	You'll find out - soon enough.
Why did you set me up?	I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.	Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?	I had to get away!  My life was in danger!	Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?	No.  A witness.	What exactly did you see?	Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...	No, but I'm listening.	I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.	Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?	Yeah...they did.  One girl...
And what did you do?	"I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it."	Found what?
I had it all on tape...	What did you do then?	I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.	What happened with the tape?	I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.	So you know about Marvosa, and Stanton, and all of them.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.	Yeah.	Where the hell is my car?
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?	No -	Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you, I promise...
What?	Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!
Tubbs, it's me.	Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?	No...I'm in some trouble...	Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?	Yeah...
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -	Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!	Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?	It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?	Jesus, man...	Please...
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...	This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
Holy shit -	Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?	Yeah, c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me!
No...	Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
And?...	I killed them.	Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!	Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -	It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -	You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -	They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.	Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!	I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
Oh man...what happened?	I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.	Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  What do you want to do?
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.	Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
I've got a better idea...	OK...where do you want to start?
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?	1490...Breckinridge...	Let's see what we got...
Donut?	No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?	I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.	I knew I could count on you.	I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.	How about Marvosa and the others?	I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -
So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.	I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.
You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.	What else is new?
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.	A bank?	Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.	Both at the same bank...	And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...	It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?	Shit, we just started.  But I better log out of this.
That was her - the girl... We have to go.	I'm not going anywhere!	Tubbs, these people mean business.	I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.	I'm going to need a way to get there.
Are you going to be alright?	Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
Where are you going?	Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?	You must be going somewhere.	I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.	Mind if I come along for the ride?
I'm stranded out here.	Hop in.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.	Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.	Are you a regular there?	Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...	Ditched you?	We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?	Bartender said there are motels south of here.
What would your - boyfriend - think?	Screw him!
You don't seem afraid of much.	Not with this...
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!	Did you have sex with her?	What?	Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?	No.  It wasn't like that!	Then what did you do, play canasta?
Where am I going?	County jail - get in.
Don't you guys ever knock?	Where is he?	Long gone... MARVOSA Well you won't mind if I don't take your word for it, right?
Long gone, huh?	I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.	Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...	Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...	Nahhh...
What about him?	I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.	Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.	That was Peterson upstairs.	It was you who did the asking.	He doesn't think you run mind games on him.	I wouldn't presume to try.	You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?	He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.	Why aren't you ever alone with him?	Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?	His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?	I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...	That's when it happened?	No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.	What's the bottom line?	If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?	Could he handle a direct contact?	I don't recommend it.
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.	If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
What have we missed?	He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?	The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.	And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.	How are Molly and the boy?	Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.	That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.	He doesn't have anything to cut with.
In thirty-five minutes.	Christ!
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.	Right.  What about sweating Lecktor?	They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.	It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.	He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
How long do I have?	Twenty minutes max.
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...	That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.	At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r.
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.	When do they go to press?
If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy...  He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  We can make out: 'six-six-six'.  I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.	Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.	Book code?	'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?	Not the Bible?	No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...	Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...	Where?	Library of Congress.
This is Chester here. Who am I talking to?	Will Graham, Jack Crawford...	"We got an ad order in tonight's ""Tattler"" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now."	Read it.	'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'	That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...	'You're very beautiful.
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?	I have to.	You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?	Because it's his bad luck to be special.	He thinks you want him to look at evidence.	Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...	You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?	No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...	I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.	I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...	I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.	How much do you know?	What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?	Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;	What else did you keep out of the papers?	Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.	Somebody hurt him?	Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?	No.	Why not?	The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...	And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.	You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.	Last two like this we had, you caught.	That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.	That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.	I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.	You look all right now.	I am all right.
If you can't look anymore, I understand...	As long as they're dead...	These are all dead, Will.
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.	I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?	He's working on the single print index. What time is it?	Get him to Atlanta.	You said the guy down here is good.	He is good. Bur not as good as Price.	What do you want to do?	Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  Neighbors are watching for it.	Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...	I know...
Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.	Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?	I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.	You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...	Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.	What's one way?	We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.	We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?	He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.	No other possibilities?	You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.	Why?	Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.	See? You do know something about him.	...I'm going to see Lecktor.
For Christ's sake, why?	To recover the mind set.
Is it weird?	The mark? Yes.	If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...	Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
Who did he ask for?	You.
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!	What is it?
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.	After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...	...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.	Personal ads?
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.	We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.	Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?	Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.	And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.	It's your call, Will. What do we do?
Run it.	What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?	We will feel sick for a very long time.
Who is it?	Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.	What'd it say?	I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.	Tell me now.	It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.	Get me a plane...	Wait, Will...	Get me a plane!	I'll pick you up in...	I won't be here.
Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. The character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  It means Red Dragon.  That mean anything to you?	No.
You got the message Lecktor called...	I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.	From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.	What's it narrow down to?	Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.	That's narrow?	When are you coming back?	When I'm done.
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.	'Changes?'	It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...	VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?	How do I know?!
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.	There's no connection between the families.	There has to be.	There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
He's a very shy boy...	What?	Something Lecktor said.	Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...	It's not over yet.	It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight.
Will?	You wanna watch this or what?!
That's why the boltcutter.	What's that?	He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?	Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.	You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?	He had to.
It's getting late and...	Don't talk to me!!
It's the guard in the storeroom.	We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.	There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.
What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.	Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...	Have him peel the top label back.	See if there's another label underneath.
It does, doesn't it?	I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
Parking permits...	Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...	This is our boy...!
Will...?	What?	You're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us.
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.	How far away's the back-up?	Three minutes.
I'll cover the back.	Stay in the trees.
There's somebody in the house, Jack...	Wait for the back-up! Will?	It's happening again, Jack...
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?	"He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham ""broken mirrors.""'"	Will. Get right back here. He just called.
Where the hell's Graham!	He went to the men's room.	For Christ's sake get him!
Not yet.	Let's get to the physical.
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?	They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.	Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...	Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.	What's being photographed?	The activities of nocturnal animals.	When do you need it?	In eight days.	Let me stick this in the black hole.
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?	It'll do fine.
I'll take you.	No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
Ride with me.	Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.	Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to.
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?	Tonic will be fine.	In the kitchen.
How did you come to Gateway?	They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
You worked out well.	You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
I'll probably go back to it someday.	Uh-huh.
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?	It's a surprise.
That was nice of you to think of that.	I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
Is that you. D?	Yes, are you okay...?!	I'm fine.
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...	No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.	My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?	I have work to do at the plant.	I'll get my purse.	I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?	I'm fine, Francis.
Reba...	Francis? Where are you?	The developing room.  I need to... see you.	I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?	No. Reba...?	Are you okay...?	I'll see you later. All right?	You'll come by?	Yes.
Who is it?	It's me.	Who?	Me.	Francis...?
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!	Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.	The Tooth...
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.	Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.	No.	THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!	No!
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...	Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!	I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?	Was I in an accident?	No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.	My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.	Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.	Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
What am I doing here?	Atoning, Mr. Lounds.
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?	I don't want to know.	According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?	Yes.	Do you feel privileged?	I'm very scared.	Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?	Yes.	Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?	I don't know...	In a little while I'll help you understand.
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.	No. I don't want to see you.	Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.  You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?	Yes...
Do you see?	Yes.
Do you see?	Yes.
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?	Yes.	Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?	Yes.	Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?	Oh, God.	Do you see?	Please, no.	'No' what?	Not me.	Are you a man?	Yes.	Do you imply that I'm a queer?	God, no.	Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?	No.
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.	'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.	You'll let me go now?	You will tell the truth?	Absolutely,	Good.  We'll seal your promise with...
Come in.	Dr. Chilton.	Yes?	When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...
Do you have it?	Yeah. It's right here.
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?	No.
Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.	I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.	As long as it's on soft paper.  You may...  Find this curious.
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?	No.	When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?
I want to see Lecktor now.	Uh... sure...
It's Will Graham...	Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....	Where did you get it?!
Can you read it to me?	"It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The ""Tooth Fairy."" What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom."
In a holding cell.	How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?	Three, four hours.
Linda King's desk.	Hi, Linda. ..	Linda doesn't come in nights.	Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.	She'll be in, in the morning...	I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
She doesn't have a Rolodex.	I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.	Yeah...	Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.	Okay.	We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.	Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.	Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too	3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.	Thank you very much.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?	No. I can help you.	I don't understand.	Atlanta and Birmingham.
Do you know something about that?	Why do you think I called?	I get a lot of calls. Most of them are from people who say they know things.
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?	You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.	Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?	I don't think I'll tell you.	He's right-handed.	Most people are.	He's misunderstood.	Cut the general crap.
He's very strong physically.	That's true.	He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.	Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.	I don't want to do that,	Goodbye.
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.	The report didn't mention nails and eyes.	Why do you think he took his gloves off?	Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?	"'Intimate? !"""	Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.	He only bit women so far, right?	That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.	What's average?	Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.  Eight in Mrs. Jacobi...  ...that's all I have.
The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecktor three years ago.  He killed nine people, didn't he?	Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.	What happened to them?	One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.	What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?	Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.	What would you call him?
To yourself...	I call him a monster.	I understand he cut you pretty good...	What about the dog?	It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.	Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?	No.	Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.	What did he want?	He asked how you are.	And you said?	I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.	I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.	You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...	We have it good, don't we?	All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
What the hell can I do?	What you've already decided. You're not really asking.	If I were?	Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?	I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
Molly?	Huh?  Will? Is that you?	It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...	Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.
Hello, hotshot!	Hey, baby! Where are you?	At the store. You doin' some good?	None you'd notice. I'm lonely...	Me, too. And very erotic...	Tell me about yourself.	Which part? That or the day-to-day.	Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?	Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.	Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...	Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.	I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.	To do what?	I have to see somebody.
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?	Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.	Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.	Blue, then.	Blue is cold.	Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...	I love you...
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.	You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.	Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?	I remember.	Do you remember what you said?	Yes. I said this is too good to live...
Can I have one of your cigarettes?	You haven't smoked in two years.	I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?	No.	Then why?	I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.	Can you quit?	No.	And... where are things?	Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
What will you do?	I have to go back to Birmingham.	Is Crawford going with you?	No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.	William: you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed.
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...	Will...
Hello.	I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?	Mama was probably asleep.	Will? Are you okay?	Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.	I want to see you, too.	Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...	Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...	Come home with me.	Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...	What's this Mama shit?	It's what Kevin called her when he was little...	What's the problem, Molly?	I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.	Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.	Will?  You could come up here.	They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you.  But they don't want to see me...	That's not true.	Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick...
Maybe we should give it some time...	Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around.
Let's forget who said what to whom...	You got a deal...
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?	Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?	Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...	You going back down to Florida after?	Yes. Is Molly there?	My grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. Been out riding. Must be the good air. You oughta see that little booger eat.  I'll bet he's gained ten pounds.  Molly's out in the motor home...	I know... 'Out in the good air...'	What's that?	Tell her I called.
Thanks for the lift.	I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.	That's right.	There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.	Thanks.
Meet point's up ahead!	Go on to the house.	Lt. Fisk said...	Go on to the house...
What do you want?	Are you George Sherman?	Yes. Who are you?	My name's Will Graham. I...	Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  That man, Crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?	No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...	I can't thank you enough, I...
Will it keep them out?	Yeah...	How many turtle eggs you think are in here?	In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.	Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?	Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.	I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...	What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?'  He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?
Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?	No. You're very well-protected.  No one can find our where you are.	Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?	Yes.	I figured I'd ask you...	I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?	I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?	We don't know that.	Are you gonna kill him?	No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.	How did it happen?	Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.	How?	With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.	You went in the apartment?	Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
Did the girl die?	No.	She got all right?	...after a while.	And Hobbs died?	...yes.
What kind of coffee do you like?	Huh?	You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.	I keep getting it for Christmas.
Did you get my card?	I got it. Thank you.
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.	Stuart is fine.	Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?	No.	Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.	Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.	And?	Very interesting, even to a layman.
A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'	You've read the transcript. It's all there.	No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?	It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?	It doesn't matter to me, Will.	I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.	Yes, I thought so.	It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.	Yes.	You read about it, I'm sure.	In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?	I thought you would have some ideas.	Why should I tell you?	There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?	Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.	You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.	Pray tell.	I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.	Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.	No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.	Then how did you catch me, Will?	You had disadvantages.	What disadvantage?	You're insane.	You're very tan, Will.
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.	I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...	Do you have the file with you	Yes.	Pictures?	Yes.	Let me have them, and I might consider it.	No.	Do you dream much, Will?	Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.	You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
What were the yards like?	Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?	Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.	That's interesting.	It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.	Yes. I'd considered it.	You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?	I want your opinion.	I don't have one right now.	When you do have one I'd like to hear it.	May I keep the file?	I haven't decided yet.	I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?
No.	Do you know how you caught me, Will?	Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.	What do you want?	You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.	I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.	I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?	Fight what?	When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!
I don't believe in God.	You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.	Why does it feel good?	It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?	Pretty well.	I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.	Yes.	Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them?
Glaser Safety Slugs?	...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?	Kevlar Second Chance.	I hope you have a second chance...	Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'	You got it.	Let's walk the route.
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.	Tank you veddy much.	So I understand you're from Lithuania?	No.  Caspiar.
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.	It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
People love... comedians.	I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?	I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!	The stewardess let me keep my headphones.	That's... terrific!  But I got something better.  This is BIG...  You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!
Sitcom...?	And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!	I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!	George, I hate sitcoms.	"HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  ""Latka,"" a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!"
No.	"""No""?  ""No"" to which part??"	No to the whole thing.  None of it sounds good.
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.	I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.	B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--	I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
You have to do it.	I refuse.	LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.	Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!	Those are my terms.	"They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- ""two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton""??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!"	He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
Andy?	Hi George!	Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?	Of course.  But only on Monday nights.	That's alright.  Where...?
Andy!	What's up?
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --	The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!	Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --	"Yeah, we can have a garage sale. ""Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"""
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.	Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
I'm sorry, George...	You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!	But George, I like to push the boundaries...	And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!
How long would they let me sleep?	I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!	Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?	Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.	Oh no!  Did he get hurt?
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.	There'll be other shots.
"You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: ""Look, Dad, I got an F!"""	But wasn't it funny?	"""Funny""?  I dunno.  But ""intriguing""... ""mindboggling""... perhaps ""headache-inducing""... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage..."
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.	But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.	No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
They're having a laugh...	WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!	That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!
"Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  ""Here I come to save the day!""?  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!"	What, you don't think I can beat him?	He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
We were just trying to push the envelope --	You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...	Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?	Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...	Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.	That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.	I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.
What was that all about?	It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
You must take a little pleasure in it.	Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.	Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
So how can I help you...?	I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!	Do you wanna tour the clubs?	No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.	So who's gonna pay for it?	Tony Clifton.	You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.	Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony better than you do.  Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!
I can't move my arm.	You've got good days and bad days.
My hair is coming out.	Yeah...
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?	Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.	Really?	Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?	Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...	You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!	Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
"What do you want?  ""Take my wife, please""??"	Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...	I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!	"Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' ""Pop Goes The Weasel."""
Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --	Andy!	Oh!
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.	You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!	B-but I have them.	No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
B-but... we saw... your neck...	Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
B-but... we saw... your neck...	Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!	But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.	But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.	But it's only for thirty seconds!
Five.	Twenty!	Ten.	Deal.
Right...	Okay, great!  So let's reset!
Cue the commercial!	These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
Excuse me -- ?	Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.	No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.	I don't wanna talk about it!
What do you mean?	I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.	I've never understood that.  It's just... getting dark.  But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!	Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.	Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Hi...	Hi... am I late?	No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
Popcorn?	No thanks.	I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
Andy, the theater's that way!	"Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through ""On Golden Pond."""
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.	Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
Hi...	Hi... am I late?	No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
Popcorn?	No thanks.	I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
Andy, the theater's that way!	"Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through ""On Golden Pond."""
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.	Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.	You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.	I'm here, ain't I?
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?	Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?	Yes.
Why Memphis?	Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
And all this will be for real?	If you want...
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!	No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??	I can shtop whenever I want...
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.	I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
Go away.	It's me.	Oh, it's open.
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.	I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.	Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.	You don't know the real me.	Andy... there is no real you.
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?	They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.	Have you told your family?	No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
How can you be so casual??!	Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.	You're NOT DYING!	Okay.  You're probably right.
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!	"Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  ""Maui?  ""Wowie!"""	You're not listening to me --	Don't worry!  The kids will love it --	But I don't do drugs!  And I don't enjoy making light of them!  I was promised creative control!
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!	I said I didn't want to do the sketch.	GET OFF!	DON'T TOUCH ME!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --	You're a wimp.	My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!	Then your father's a wimp.	And you're just poor white trash!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --	You're a wimp.	My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!	Then your father's a wimp.	And you're just poor white trash!
Hey Andy, good show.	Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
I'm gonna quit.	What?!?	Each show is worse than the next.	Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!	So?  What do they know?	Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
Give me the book.	No!  Andy, don't do it --	They're asking for it.
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?	"She'll say, ""Now my son is a man."""	It's so dirty.	Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
"""Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"""	Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!	What is this, World War Two...?	You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...	No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
"""... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi""..."	It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.	It's working for Elvis.
Sir, do you have a problem?	Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
I, I was asked to do this material - -	Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...	Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --	Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
I was very original!	"Yeah, exactly -- ""was""!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???"
This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?	I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.	"Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the ""Hallelujah Chorus"" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!"	"And you say, ""Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?""  And he says, ""Cancer!"""	No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
Are you at peace with your family?	Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.	Goals are important.	I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...	We are all impressed.
Excuse me, Andy...	Yes, your Holiness?
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.	Why??  I... I attend every year.	Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to TM.  But we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically.
"""Philosophically""?"	The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!	It is apparently not working.	So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!	Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.	Are you sure?	Positive.	But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...	It's probably just a strained muscle.	Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.	Oh.
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??	Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!	No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.	I'll take my chances!!
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!	Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --	Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!	Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
"""Burlesque""?"	Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
We had a deal!!	I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --	Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!	I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
Get off my stage!  You're fired!	I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?	Er, yes.  Speaking.	"""Speaking""!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!"
Can I help you with something?	Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!	Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.	Look... I don't know what your problem is...	Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!
That was a really hot house!	So your name's not Gorsky.	Don't believe everything you hear.
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.	Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.	Bob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special.  Something nice...
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.	Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!	But what's the POINT?  How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?
"Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  ""It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."""	Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
Why...?  Andy, why...?	I used to think you were original.
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...	FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.	What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.	Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Is he in his room?	"Of course he's in his room.  All his ""friends"" are in there."
I saw Michael!	Where?	There!
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.	He said he's coming back!
What's in Memphis?	Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
Why is he saying these things?!	They're gonna lynch him!
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!	Why isn't he MOVING??
Sure...	What's your name?	Bob.	"""Bob""?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?"	Bob Gorsky.	"""Gorsky""?  What is that, Polish?"	Yes.
Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!	It's my name.	SHUT UP!  I hate them Polish jokes!
A -- a tourist.	See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
Then the informant is real.	Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.	He'll be contacting us again.	Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?	Their next target.  The name is Neo.
We'll need a search running.	It's already begun.
They are dead.  In either case --	We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
You don't know.	Know what?
The sewers.  Of course.	Hurry!	They won't make it.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.	And you are?	Smith.  I am Agent Smith.	You all look the same to me.
Lieutenant?	Oh shit.	Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --	I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.	The orders were for your protection.
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.	No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
He's gonna make it.	No way.  Not possible.
Weird.	What?	That's the third white van I've seen.	Should Tank I.D. it?
What?!	Oh, God.
Who is it?	It's Choi.
You're two hours late.	I know.  It's her fault.
You got the money?	Two grand.
Hallelujah!  You are my savior, man! My own personal Jesus Christ!	If you get caught using that --	I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.	Right...
Something wrong, man?  You look a little whiter than usual.	I don't know... My computer...
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?	All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
You weren't supposed to relieve me.	I know but I felt like taking a shift.
Don't be ridiculous.	We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.	Morpheus believes he is the One.
Do you?	I... it doesn't matter what I believe.	You don't, do you?	If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.	I intend to, believe me.  Someone has to.
Did you hear that?	Hear what?
Are you sure this line is clean?	Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
There's something about him, isn't there?	Don't tell me you're a believer now?	I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.	Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
Hello, Trinity.	Cypher?  Where's Tank?	He had an accident.	An accident?!
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.	You killed them.
I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.	My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.	Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.	The Matrix isn't real!	Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean, all I do is pull a plug here.  But there, you watch a man die.
But you're out, Cypher.  You can't go back.	That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
Goddamn you, Cypher!	Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.
... yes.	No!
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!	He's going to pop!
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.	Sorry.	No, it's all right.	What are you doing?	Midnight watch.
Is that...?	The Matrix?  Yeah.
Do you always look at it encoded?	Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
Why you're here?	... Yeah.	Gee-zus!  What a mindfuck.  You're here to save the world.  You gotta be shitting me.  What do you say to something like that?
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.	Really?	You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.	How many were there?	Five.  Since I've been here.	What happened to them?	Dead.  All dead.	How?	Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.
Thanks... for the drink.	Any time.
Operator.	I need an exit!  Fast!	Cypher?
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.	I got you.	Just get me outta here.	Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.	Are they any agent?	Yes.	Goddamnit!	You have to focus.  There is a phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can make it.
All right --	Go.
I got a fibrillation!	Shit!  Apoc?
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.	What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
Give me your phone.	They'll be able to track it.	We have no choice.
What is he doing?	He's beginning to believe.
How long?	Five minutes.  Maybe six.
You can't use that until Neo is out!	I know, Trinity.  Don't worry.  He's going to make it.
Hello?	Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
Morpheus...	I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.	Who's coming for me?	Stand up and see for yourself.	Right now?	Yes.  Now.
Holy fucking shit!	Yes.
What the fuck do they want with me?!	I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.	How?!	I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
The cubicle across from you is empty.	But what if...?	Go!  Now!
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.	How do you know all this?
No!  It's too far away.	There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
No way, no way, this is crazy.	There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.	The agents --	They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.	What do you know?	You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
Do you still want to meet?	... Yes.	Go the the Adams Street bridge.
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.	It's an honor.	Please.  Come.  Sit.
I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?	You could say that.	I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?	You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.	Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?	No.	Why not?	Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.	I know exactly what you mean.
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?	The Matrix?	Do you want to know what it is?
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.	What truth?	That you are a slave, Neo.  Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind.
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.	What does that mean?
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?	This can't be...	Be what?  Be real?
... am I dead?	Far from it.
What are you doing?	Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
Why do my eyes hurt?	You've never used them before.
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?	More important than what is when?	When?	You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
Right now, we're inside a computer program?	Wild, isn't it?
This isn't real?	What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.	A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?	Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  I say almost funny.
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!	I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.	For what?	Your training.
This is incredible.  I know kung fu.	Show me.
How did I beat you?	You -- you're too fast.	Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
I know what you're trying to do --	I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank, load the jump program.
Do you know why you didn't make it?	Because... I didn't think I would?
I thought it wasn't real.	Your mind makes it real.
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?	The body cannot live without the mind.
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.	What -- what lesson?
Do you understand, Neo?	I think I do.	No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?	Yeah.	Look again.
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.	How?	I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?	No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
Set down in there.	What's going on?
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?	Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.	The beginning?	Of the Resistance.	And she knows what?  Everything?	She would say she knows enough.	How does she know?	She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.	And she's never wrong.	Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.	She helped you?	Yes.	What did she tell you?	That I would find the One.
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.	Why?	I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?	What do you believe in?	What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.	That's why we're here.	Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?	Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.	And you still believe I'm the One?	Yes I do.	Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them?
Did you believe in them too?	No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.	Morpheus, I don't know --	I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!	Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --	She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
How is he?	Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
Got it.	I need the main wet-wall.
Now left and that's it in front of you.	Good.
Tank.	Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!	We need an exit.	Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.	We're on our way --
Tank, charge the E.M.P.	Yes, sir.
I'm going to make the call.	Do it!
How...?!	He is the One.  He is the One!
Hello?	I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.	You're the Oracle?	Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?	Yeah.	I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.	What vase?
That vase.	Shit, I'm sorry.
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.	How did you know...?
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.	Who?	Not too bright though.
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?	Honestly?  I don't know.
Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --	But what?	But you already know what I'm going to tell you.	I'm not the One.	Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.	What?	Your next life, maybe.  Who knows. That's how these things go.
What's funny?	Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.	I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.	What do you mean, without him?
Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.	What?	You're going to have to make a final choice.  In one hand, you will have Morpheus' life.  In the other hand, you will have your own.  One of you is going to die.  Which one, will be up to you.
Hello, Neo.	How do you know that name?	I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.	Who are you?	My name is Trinity.	Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?	That was a long time ago.	Gee-zus.	What?	I just thought... you were a guy.	Most guys do.
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?	No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
How did you do that?	Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.	Of what?	They're watching you, Neo.	Who is?	Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.	What is the Matrix?	When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  They have to see it to believe it.
What the hell is this?!	It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.	From what?	From you.
Neo, please, you have to trust me.	Why?	Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road.  You know exactly where it ends.
And I know that's not where you want to be.	... shit.
What is this thing?	We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
Uh-oh...	It's going into replication.
Get this thing out of me!	Easy, Neo.  Easy.
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.	It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
God...	What?	I used to eat there... Really good noodles.
What does that mean?	That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.	But an Oracle can.	That's different.	Is it?	Are you worried?	Should I be?	No.
Did you go to her?	Yes.	What did she tell you?	She told me...
Are you all right?	... right as rain.
What did you just say?	Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.	What happened?  What did you see?	A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.	How much like it?  Was it the same cat?	It might have been.  I'm not sure.
What is it?	A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
Go!	We can't leave him!	We have to!
Is Morpheus alive?	Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
What happened?	I don't know.  It just went dead.
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!	There has to be something that we can do.
That I would have to make a choice...	What choice?
What are you doing?	I'm going in after him.	You can't!	I have to.	Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!	Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.	What?	I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
No, you... have to be.	I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.	No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.	Why?	Because...
What?	I believe I can bring him back.
What are you doing?	I'm coming with you.	No, you're not.	No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
No one has ever done anything like this.	Yeah?
Neo, how did you do that?	Do what?	You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.	It wasn't fast enough.
Are you all right?	I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
Can you fly that thing.	Not yet.
Morning.  Did you sleep?	No.	You will tonight.  I guarantee it. I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.
You don't have...	Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.	Zion?	If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.	It's a city?	The last human city.  The only place we got left.	Where is it?	Deep underground.  Near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  You live long enough, you might even see it.
Holy shit!	Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?	Hell yes!
See who?	The Oracle.
What are they doing to him?	They're hacking his mind.	How?	They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.	How much time?	Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.	What do they want?	Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything.
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!	Neo, this has to be done!	Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?	What are you talking about?	The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...
Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.	I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.	Why?	Because I believe in something.
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...	Guns.  Lots of guns.
Operator.	Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
Which way?  Which way?	Duck!
It's locked.	Kick it in!  Kick it in!
Operator.	Tank, it's me.
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.	He's alive.
We need an exit!	You're not far from Cypher.	Cypher, I thought --	So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.	Got it.
Tank, you're hurt.	I'll be all right.	Dozer?
There is.  We have to pull the plug.	You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!	Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
Operator.	Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
Neo!	What the hell just happened?	An Agent!  You have to send me back!	I can't!
What just happened?	I don't know.  I lost him.
They've burned through the outer shields.	Hurry, Neo.
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?	Yeah.  But he ain't here now.	Know where he is?	Follow me.
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.	Thanks.
What are your plans?	Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...	Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...	Sounds good.	Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?	Look fella...this is private...	Nothing's private...
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.	Let go of her.
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.	Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...	Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
No.	That means it's good.	You got sparklers?
No, all we got is $40.	You sure?
Riverdale.	Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?
Sssh!  Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.	Well the guy over there said...	Yeah, yeah, never mind.  You gotta be careful.
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...	All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
Well, we want good stuff.	Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
Yeah.	And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?	Ok.  For another $5.00 a special on the packs.
Yeah.	Ok.  Wait here.
Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.	Why?	I gotta get the stuff.	Can't we come with you?	Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business.  I'll be back in thirty minutes.
Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.	Uh...can we give you a check?	A check?  What the...hey, where you kids from?
Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.	Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...	Be careful.
See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'	'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?	You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.	Look who's talking.  Pretentious bullshit.  Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh?
No.	Anybody wanna have a game?
May God be with you.	'And with your spirit.'	Salute!!!
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?	'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'	'Thou art then a king?'	'Thou sayest it; I am a king.  This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth.  Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?	I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
Who's the girl?	Jewish...	How do you know?
Look at her.	She don't look Jewish.	Sure she is.  She's always in here with some different guy.  You know the way they are.
Get out of here before this really goes up.	Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?	Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away.  You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
Where to?	Kennedy.	I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?	It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.	So?	So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.	Nervous?	Yeah.	You flew before?	No.
Hey, come on...	Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.	Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.	How about Teresa?  I could talk...	Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.	And say what?	I'll say that I'm travelling.
Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.	Thanks for the ride.
Panther...	Panther!  Same thing...	Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.	Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.	Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.
Waddaya think?	Not quite...but keep trying.
Next time, bet with your own kind.	The number was 235 - I bet it combination.	It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.	I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
You got some mouth!	Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
Drinks for everybody Tony...	Giovanino!  Where have you been?
What happened to you Flash?	Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.	I know but let's hear it anyway.	I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
It's the truth, I swear.	All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
Nah.	C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.	Should I slap him?
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?	No, she isn't.
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.	Wouldn't bother me.	Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.	Don't worry.  I can handle it.
You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.	There won't be any this week.	What do you mean?	Didn't show up.	You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?	I don't like loading crates.	You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.	What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?	I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?	Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.	Don't promise...just deliver.	Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.	Listen...I'm a guest here.
Hey...you got nothing here.	I could have told you that.	We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something.
Don't come any closer!!!	Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.	Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
Let's get out of here.	Did you see them run!
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.	That's not going to help.	I'm going to work this week...I mean it.	It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?	I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.	Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?	Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.	How?	If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.	That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out.
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?	Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.	That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!	I understand.
Keep your mouth shut.	You tell me that in front of these creeps?
Shut up!	Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...	Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?	Don't be smart.	I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...	Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?	What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!	No you're not...
Oh, cut it out, will ya?	Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?	NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???	No, I just want to help myself, that's all.	Come on.
Don't you move!!!	I'll be here.  Don't worry.
Back so soon.	Mind your own business.
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...	He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
I think we should see your uncle.	No.	This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.	Forget it.
What are you going to do?  Hide me?	Good idea.
Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?	Ok, how's everything going?
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?	No.	I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?	What pipes?	What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.	That bad, huh?	I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.	Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.	Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.	He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.	I don't understand, where's Groppi?	I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?	My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.	What can I say?
Oh great...hey - Winstons?	For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see...
OK, ok...	Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
No...I'll be ok for a week.	You seen Johnny Boy tonight?	Nope...	Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...	Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?	I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.	Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.	I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?	You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.	Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?	OK.
Michael, give us a lift.	OK, get in.
Hey, shut up.	Get him in.
Disgraceful.	Ok...that's it.
Out!!!!	C'mon Johnny.	You getting out too?	Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
Oh Michael, look...	Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...	Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?	All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.	We'll settle it tonight.
What's a'matter?	Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.	How much?	$20.	Let's go to the movies...on you.
Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.	He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.	How much was the original loan again?	$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.	$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?	Charlie, this is business.	'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'	I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.	'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...	'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'	You said it.
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?	We'll be here.
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?	Whatever.
Where's the rest?	Yeah, where's the rest?
You're really crazy.	You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
Diane, how are you feeling?	Fine.
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...	Fine.	No, I'm serious...You're really good.	I know.	In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.	That's nice.
I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.	Stripper?	No...no stripping...as the hostess.	Hostess?	Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.	Chinese food?	Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.	Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.	Bye.
Uncle, how are you feeling?	Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?	About that shooting last night...I was there and...	No you weren't.
You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.	Yes, you did.
About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it.  He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.	No...his business is bad.  But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
Take a drink!	Ok.
Hey, where you been?	Oh...around...why?	You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...	Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?	Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?	Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.	You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
Oh yes, he's pretty good.	What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...	What did he do?
His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...	Teresa.	...The one who's sick, right?  In the head.
No, she's got epilepsy.	Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?	What do they expect you to say?	"Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm ""cumpari"" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved."	All right.
Well, maybe you missed something?	Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
Wasn't a book...was a short story.	What was it?	Nothing.	No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.	"""Francis Macomber."""	Wha?	"""Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."""	Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.	Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?	Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.	Ok, we'll go for lunch.	Do you have enough?
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...	Here.
Please take it.	Well...	I don't mind.
Sure...it's not that...I mean...	It's all right.	Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.	An apartment uptown?  Downtown?	Maybe, who knows.	Charlie...?	Nobody knows anything, believe me.
See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.	Anything specific?	You know...like restaurants, night clubs...	What is it now?	Don't ask.
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?	Did you?	No.	CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.	It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.	You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.	It's still sick.	Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.	No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.	Ok.
Bore.	A paper on that one too?	Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.	It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.	Take your time.  I don't care.	I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.	That's the word...preoccupied.
See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?	Sure...He lives there?	No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
That W.A.S.P. bastard.	You're intolerable today.	Watch your language.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.	Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
You know why...with my parents.	Well you can't blame them in a way.	I can take care of myself.  You know that.	I know...I know.
...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?	Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.	Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
I'm sleepy.	You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.	The green capsules in the top drawer.
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!	Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...	Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...	Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.	But...
Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?	For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.	The girls like it loud.	Girls?  You call those skanks girls?!
What's the matter with this kid?	I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
Don't count it...it's all there.	Count it.	Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?	Which one, the big tab or the little tab?	Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.	Yeah, so things'll be even.
Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?	We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.
Scumbag--	Shut up.
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?	Sal!... fourteen street.	Come on.	This is some boat.  Your father's?	Yeah...just had it delivered...
Hey... you got stereo.	Yeah, I think so.
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.	I know...I know.	What'sa matter...forget your registration?	No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.	Yeah, it's your father's.	Well...no.	You mean it's heisted.	You could say that.	This is a heisted car!
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?	Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.	You what?
Just keep him quiet.	Friends of yours Michael.	Shut up.
Must have been all the liquor in him.	Quiet please.
How much?	Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.	Can you spare it?	Sure.	Thanks.
Yeah.	Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.	Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --	You ate?	...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting.  What's on the table for discussion?  Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --
That's your name?	And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?	Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --	...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
-- But he does seem very nice.	You think so?
Look who's talking.	Yeah, speak for yourself.
Dinner?  Again?	Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
Did you speak to the Governor?	He's coming.	His wife?	Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
Daddy!  Come on, a name.	Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
Just plain 'Joe'?	Love that name.
That was 'Joe'.	He's cute.	Very.
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.	Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Daddy!	Hi, Allison --	Have you got a minute?	Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?	Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...	Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.	But it's your birthday.
I hate parties --	Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.	Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.	No.
What, honey?	I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --	I know you do, darling.	And you could care less --	Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.	Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?	A name?
-- Black.	Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---	We've got some things to discuss.
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?	Who?	From the Korean War.	Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.	Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --	Of course.	You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.	I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.	That's okay, Daddy.
What is this?	Annie made them.	Who's Annie?	From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.	I don't like cake.	It's for the party, Dad --	Oh, the goddam party --	'Goddam party'!
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?	It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?	The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.	Do they, m'dear?	-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.	Yeah?  And what about my enemies?	They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love?
I haven't been the father to you that --	That you've been to Susan?	I wasn't going to say --	"But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, ""What does she want now?"""
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.	Yes, it is.
Honey, please.	Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!	Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's.  You too, Drew.  We've still got some loose ends --
What about the Mayor?	He said he would be there with bells on.
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.	No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
Paillarde of veal.	Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.	Honey --!	You know what I'm saying, Joe?
Yeah, but --	But what?	What will I tell Annie?
...This shit's not bad.	-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.	And that?	Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
What do you do that for?	Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.	9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.	Okay, give me a bottle of wine.	Red or white?	Both.
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.	Good, good.  Glad to hear it.	We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?	I'm sorry, I don't recall --	Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --	I thought you were buying my company.	Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
Yes, sir?	Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.	Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
What are you eating.	You mean this, sir?
'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?	I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
I would prefer some peanut butter.	How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?	Toast?  No...just the butter.	Right away.
Hello, Beautiful.	Hi.
-- Did I hear 'business'?	What 'business'?
...See you tomorrow night.	Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.	You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --	Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.	Drew, you're out of line.	That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.	Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?	No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
Well... goodnight.	Yeah.  Goodnight.
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.	That's it.  It's over.  Get out.	So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
And what would that be?	Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.	You're taking this too far, Drew.	Am I not obligated to?
Thank you for coming.	Hello, Quince.
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --	Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.	He'll wait --
We have an arrangement now.	What side of the industry did you say you were on?	I didn't say.	Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?	Here...	'Here'?
Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.	Thank you.	The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --	Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?	Why yes, thank you.	Hot or cold.	Cold.	And a glass.
Yes.	"""Death and Taxes""?"
Yes.	What an odd pairing.	It's just a saying, Mr. Black,	Of whom?	It doesn't matter.	Then why did you bring it up?
May I interrupting?	Yes.
No.	Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
Who are we talking about?	But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.	Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?	Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
Perhaps you could remind me.	I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
No, I don't --	Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.	-- And now you're going to pee some more.
I'm not stepping anywhere --	I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --	The dagger --?
Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.	Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?	'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.	A voice?	In my sleep.	What'd it say?	'Yes'.	'Yes' to the deal?	Maybe, who knows?  You know how voices are.  Let's go.
I was saying to Quince we won't need --	Did you just hear something?	Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --	No no, not you.
...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?	Sounds good.	It's going to be great --	Do you think I need a haircut?	Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.	That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
I'm all excited --	Me, too.	I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --	Like a marriage made in heaven?	You have a way with words.
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?	As close as a deal could be.	Olympic.
Yeah, something he goes by --	Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --	What?!
'Joe...'	Yes.	Is there any more to it?	What do you mean?	Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
Have we met?	Uh -- he's from out of town --
No --	I get the feeling you've done some business before.
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.	Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.	That's your privilege, Bill.  But given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu- ture, the truth is... joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes.
"You're not familiar with the phrase, ""In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes""?"	I am now.	Glad I could be of some help.
Shall we adjourn?	But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
No.	'Just kidding'?	Sit down, Drew.	Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.	Joe and I have no secrets from each other.	How nice for you both.
Why?	I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.	I thought this was practically a done deal --	Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.	As much as Joe's?
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.	For how long?  And why?	Please.  Don't worry about him.  And above all, don't antagonize him.
Mind if I throw up?	Please, Drew.
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.	Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.	Sure.
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.	Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.	What are their feelings?	If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.	Over my dead body.
What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?	I don't care.	With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
Whose?	Yours.	I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.	I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
I think it's time you went home, Drew.	Certainly.  Goodnight.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?	I don't think so.  Do you?
That's it?	Bontecou wants a quick response and --	The answer is no, quick enough for you?	Don't you want to hear the details?	I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.	So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?	Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?	Certainly, Bill.	Are you running this Board or am I?
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.	But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
In English, please.	Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --	The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.	Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --	No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
And what do I get?	You get not to go to jail.	You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.	Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?	Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --	I know.  Gum up the works.
You're overthinking it --	I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
Well, I guess he's found one.	Joe, you do get around.
...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.	Thanks, Quince.	Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.	Are you?	We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.	'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?	Yeah.	'It's up to Joe', huh?	Yeah, that's what he said.	Well, that's very interesting.
I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.	Yeah.  Neat.
I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.	You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?
Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.	How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?	He was interested.	-- But he was concerned about the timing?	The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.	'It's up to Joe'?	That's what he said.
What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!	That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
I'm going to put a stop to this!	Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.	But I didn't mean to do it!	The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.	Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.	He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.	He said that?	Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.	Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
Obeah.	Obeah evil.  I not evil.	What you then?	I from dat nex' place.	You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?	No, no.  I on holiday.	Some spot you pick.
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.	Make it go 'way.	Doctor lady make it irey.	Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.	Can't, sistah.	Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
Not time yet.	Make it time.
Don' be facety, woman.	None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.	No, I come to see Doctor.	Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?	Nuthin'.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?	Yes.	My Doctor Lady?	Mine, too.
Yah.	You loved back?	I am.	She knows you real self?	She knows how she feel.	Rass!	Don' need you okayin'.	Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.	Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.	Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.	Can do no right by people.  Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.	Hi, Jennifer.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?	Sure.	Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_	No.  Nothing.	Nothing?
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.	Didn't the family get together last night --?	Jennifer.	Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.	Good morning, Jennifer.	The Board is waiting.	What?	Didn't you call a Board meeting?
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.	Yes?	You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.	Are you?
How long you here, Joe?	As long as it takes.
Black.	Hey, this is fun.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.	It's so very nice to see you again.
That's very gracious of you, Quince.	No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.	I didn't know that.	On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...	And you're a nice man, Quince.	Thanks.	You're welcome.
C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.	Do I?  I'm a little confused.	Confused, huh?  About what?	Love.	'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.	You love Allison, don't you?	Oh yes, I do.	How did you meet?	I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.	But she loves you?
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.	'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?	Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.	What do you mean 'free'?	Free to love each other.  Com- pletely.  Totally.  No fear.
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.	What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
You think so?  How do you know?	Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?	No.
What are you doing here?	I'm lost.	-- Can't seem to escape you today.	I'm sorry.
'Big'?	You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.	I am Joe.	Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.	That is not my intention.
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?	Peanut butter.
You act like you never had peanut butter before --	I haven't.	-- What kind of childhood did you have?	Do you love Drew?	Come again?	When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.	Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.	I'm sorry.  Do you live here?	No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.	I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.	I've got plenty of friends.	I don't have any.	I can see why.
Yes --?	I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.	I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.
Susan?	Yes?	Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
Goodnight, Joe.	Goodnight to you, Susan.
Yes?	I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
Joe --	How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
Oh goodness, no.	Then why are you here, Joe?	I came to see you.	I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --	Very well, I'll watch.	Watch me do what?	Whatever you do.	That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --	And I'll be a visitor.	Patients have visitors, not doctors.	I don't mind --
She's in a great deal of pain.	Yes.
Joe, I'm with Drew.	Not now.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --	Be sorry for nothing.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --	I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.	Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.	It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.	I appreciate you --	Excuse me?	I mean I appreciate that.	And I appreciate you, too.
Why do you love peanut butter so much?	I don't know.	I adore things like that....food I can't do without.  Don't you?
Yes...	It comforts you, doesn't it?	Yes...I've found that it does.
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.	I am, too.	Has her pain abated?	We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.	I'm sorry to hear that.
How long have you been standing there?	I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
Why?	Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
No, I'm not.	Girlfriend?	No.	Gay?	No.
Where are you going?	To bed.	'To bed'?	Yes.  I'm tired.
You first.	Why don't you get off his case?
Almost.	I said get out.
I'm sorry about --	Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
I love your smell.	-- I guess you haven't.
Thank you.	It was everything.
-- Could you?	Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?	Why, yes.  Thank you.
Yes?	I don't know who you are.	Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --	And is your heart beating strangely?	Faster.  And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
You're here?	I am.
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --	How beautiful.
He's taking a nap.	He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --	Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
...No.	Maybe it's the draft through the door.
Did you like making love to me?	I loved it.	More than you love peanut butter?	Yes!
Where are you going?	Nowhere?  I'm...here.	For how long?	Oh, I hope a long, long time.
I like you in a black tie.	I love you in an evening gown.	It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.	Where are you going?
Well -- I --	And you can't tell me who you are.
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.	It gets worse.	No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.	Then don't.
We know so little about each other --	We know all that we need to know --	But there's so much to tell you --	Don't.  That will come later.	Will it?	Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
What will we do?	'Love will find out the way'.	'Love will find out the way'?	It's a saying.	I believe that, don't you?	Yes, that's why I said it.
Did I say that?	And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
The 'coffee shop' --	-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
I - uh --	You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
I'm still here.	But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --	I love you now, I'll love you always --	Hold me --
Susan --	-- Yes?	Thank you for loving me.
That's it?	Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --	You think so?	Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
No --	Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
Joe, that's the kitchen.	Thank you.
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.	'Threw' you?  Where?	Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --	I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.	So there's nothing between you and Susan?	No.	I wish you had said something to me about staying here --	It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
What a good idea.	Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?	No.
If there is anything else, don't hesitate --	I won't.	How long have I got?	You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
When you go, I go.	That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.	...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.	Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?	No --	I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.	Closer than that.
Well, thank you for letting me know.	Not at all.	And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.	Good night to you, Bill.
Good morning.	Good morning, Bill.	How are you?  How're you feeling?	'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?	Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?	Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
And what?	And I won't tell anyone who you are.	Sounds fair enough.	It is a deal?	A 'deal'?	You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
Bill --	Yes?	You've got a deal.
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?	What do you mean?	You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?	I guess so.	So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.	Of course.	So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Joe --?	Yes, Bill.	How about giving a guy a break?	Make an exception?	There's one to every rule.	Not this.
-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --	That's what everybody says.	I'm not everybody.	That's what everybody says.
I want to live.	I understand.
What's it like?	What do you mean?	What's it like where I'm going?	Can you keep a secret?	Yes.	So can I.
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?	No.	What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.	I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
Would you like to sit down, Joe?	Yes.
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?	I don't understand.
...I'd like to be alone for a while.	Are you sad, Bill?	Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?	You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?	Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.	Of course.
Now I'd like to be alone.	Oh.  Okay.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.	No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
Are you going to eat your lunch	It's all yours.
Excellent.  What is it?	Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
Truly - uh - splendid.	Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --	Uh-huh.	Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
And more.	Why didn't you stop me?	Well...I don't know.
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --	This part I'm interested in.
Dinner?  Absolutely.	Absolutely.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?	I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?	Okay.	And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.	Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
Why did you go to the hospital?	I don't know.	You were just curious?	I guess...	About Susan?	I wouldn't put it that way.	What way would you put it?	You tell me, Bill.	How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.	Are you going to fire me, Bill?
Hello, Bill.	Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?	Um -- not right now.
Okay.  Goodnight.	Goodnight.
I'm sorry, Bill --	That's okay.	What's okay?	Just a manner of speaking.
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?	'Fish'?	Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going to take a nap.
I'm not hungry.	Then I can't help you.
I couldn't sleep.	I'm sorry to hear that.
Yes, I saw you see me.	Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.	I'll be the judge of that.	I'm her father!	With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.	Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.	'Spooning'?	Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --	I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct.  You've lived a first-rate life.  And I find it eminently usable.
You're violating the laws of the universe.	This universe?	Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.	I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.	And I don't give a shit.	May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.	Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.	I told you, 'watch it'.
Uh --	Yes?	-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.	What are you saying, that it's time to go?
You are?	Yeah.	Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
Thanks.	Not at all.
What the hell do you care?	I was just asking, Bill.	You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it.  And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death.
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.	Say again?	I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
You're what?	I think you heard me, Bill.	You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
I'm sorry, Bill --	Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.	I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.	How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --	Then what is it?	Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.	Which is what?	Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.	So that's what love is?	Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.	Those were my words, Bill.	Well, they're mine now.
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.	With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?	No.	Does she know where she's going?
I don't like what you're saying.	I don't expect you to.	Are you threatening me?	I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
Okay.	Get him in here.
Joe, don't do this --	It's time to put this person where he belongs.	It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
I told you to shut up.	Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --	He is --	I'll take it from here --  I am --	-- An IRS man.
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.	And we're very grateful.	Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --	Undisclosed conflict of interest --	An offense --	An indictable offense.
Happy Birthday, Bill.	Thank you.
Not exactly.	I guess you have your reasons.	Yes.
Yes.	That's life.  What can I tell you?
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?	I am not a dream.	You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you?
You are --?	'...Yes --'
Yes.	Death!	That's me.	You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.	The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?
You want me to be your guide --?	You fill the bill, Bill.	I do?  How long will you be staying?	You should hope quite a while.	And then --?
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.	Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
Excuse me?  Could I say something?	Of course.	It just occurred to me --	Speak up, please.	When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.	Then don't.
'...I know, it's none of my business.'	What?
'Yes' what?	'Yes' is the answer to your question.	I didn't ask any question.	I believe you did.
I think you know --	I don't!	Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
What are you talking about?	What you were talking about.
Are you giving me orders?	I'm sorry, I --	No, you're not.  You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
Where are you?  Are you there?	It's enough now.	Please.  Talk to me --	There's going to be plenty of time for that.	What do you mean?!	I think you know --	Know what?  Know what, goddammit!
Where are you?	I'm here.
What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --	Quiet.
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --	What the hell is this?  Who are you?	Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
About what?	I want to have a look around before I take you.	'Take me'...?  Where?	It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.	'The one' to do what?	Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...	Get what?	Time.	What the hell are you talking about?	Watch it!	I'm sorry --	In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
Yes what?	'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.	What question?	Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --	The 'question' --	Yes, Bill.  The question.
Hi, Bill --	Good morning, Quince.	How're you doing--?	I'm doing great.  You ready?	I am, this is it.  B Day.	How's that, Quince?	Bontecou Day.  Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.	Thank you, Quince.	But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.	Next week?	Yeah.  Or the week after.
No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.	Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.	No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?	Yeah, I give a shit.	See.  There.  What'd I tell you?
This one.	The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --	It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?	Sure.
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?	Yes, I believe I do.
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.	You think Drew will go for it?	Quince, I've got confidence in you.	Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?	Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.	"Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings"" shit."	I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?	Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.	I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
Eddie?	Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?	Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?	The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.	Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --	No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.	If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.	Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?	Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.
We're all here, Bill --	I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.	We're all ears.
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.	But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
Good morning, Dad.	Hi, honey.
Drew's aboard?	He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --	How did you know?	Drew told me.	Does Drew tell you everything?	I hope so.	You like him, don't you?	Yeah.  I guess so.
I don't like to interfere.	...Then don't.
Not my birthday again?	You're only six-five once.	Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's get this day started.
I thought you were in a meeting--?	I am.  With you.
...There's a start for a meeting.	I know it's none of my business --
Do you love Drew?	You mean like you loved Mom?	Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?	Probably.
Don't get carried away.	Uh oh --	Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --	And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.	Well, I wasn't going to say that --	What were you going to say?	Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.	So what's wrong with that?	That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.	You're not listening --	Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.	Don't get dirty, Dad --	Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.	That's all?	Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.	'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.	Bravo.	Aw, you're tough.	I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.	Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.	You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.	You're terrible.	I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
Thank God.	He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
Daddy, what's the matter?	Nothing.  I'm sorry.
What is it, Daddy --?	Nothing.
Are you okay?	A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.	Well, go get 'em, Pops.	Yer damn right.
You know each other?	We've met.	What?!	-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?	Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.	Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
It'll come back, Daddy.	Will it?...
That was wonderful.	Yeah, it's good to get together.	Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?	Raise away.	What is the nature of your interest in Joe?	"Well, remember how you told me about ""lightning striking""?  The nature of it's in there somewhere."
I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --	Then what will you say?	I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --	Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?	Nothing.	When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.	Then what is it?	It's something.
Where's Joe?	Joe?
Where is he?	I don't know.
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.	I don't understand.	Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived.
This is crazy --	Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?	You don't know anything about Joe --	What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.	Where's he going?	I don't know, I can't say --	C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --	In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I just can't help you.  I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.
I love him.	I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
What a night.	I'm having a helluva time.
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --	I'm sorry.
Are you relieved?	Yes, but --
But what?	I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.	Daddy --	No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
I love you, Daddy --	That's why it's okay.
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?	Oh, yes --
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.	Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
What was that?	The fireworks are about to start.
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.	Not at all.  It was fascinating.	Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?	You and 'Honey'?	My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.	I'm sorry --	Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?	What's the way?	Nothing lasts.	I agree --	Why?	I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?	I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.	So you're a one-girl guy?	Damn right.  Looking for her right now.  Who knows?  You might be her.
How'd you know?	Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?	Me?  Internal medicine.
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?	I could be her.	'Her'.
Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.	-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
Not at all.	How 'bout another cup of coffee?	I've got patients coming in --	And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
...It's kind of a pro bono job.	'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?	I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --	You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?	I would.
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --	You never know.  Lightning could strike.
I've got to go --	Did I say something wrong?	No, it was so right it scares me.	I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.	Why?	Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.	Why not?	Because I like you so much.  Now I've got to go.
You said you liked me.	No --	Y'didn't?
...We know so little about each other.	But we've got time.
21.	It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
38.	This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
39.	Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
78.	I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
79.	Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.	I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.	MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
30.	Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
47.	I think I know her.
66.	Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
69.	From what?
Well, what then?	It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
Slam it?	Just loud enough to wake me up.	That's it?	That's it.
Should I wear it?	No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.	Whatever gets you off.
Hiya.	I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.	What can I do for you, Leonard?	I'm sorry... um... ?	Burt.	Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
You don't know?	I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.	You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?	That's the thing. I have this condition.	Condition?	I have no memory.	Amnesia?	No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...
My wife.	What's it like?	"Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *"	"That must suck. All... backwards.				 *"
How long have I been here?	Couple days.	So you're holding my calls?	As requested.
What makes you think he's my friend?	Seen you together, that's all.	He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.	Hi, Leonard.
Shit. Wrong room.	What?
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.	This isn't my room?	No, let's go.	Then why is this my handwriting?
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.	When was I in here?	Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.	Why?	Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.	"Why didn't you clean it out?					 *"	You're still paying for it. It's still Your room.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?	"Just two. So far.							  *"
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.	Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.	You don't have to be that honest, Burt.	Leonard.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.	Hi, Leonard.
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.	Yeah?
I know you said you didn't want any calls...	That's right I did, didn't I?	Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.	A cop?	"And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *"	"* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *"
What?	Who did this to you?	You did.
I haven't made a strong enough impression.	Don't be too hard on yourself.
I like your car.	Thanks.	Where'd you get it?	Interested in buying one?	I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.	I forget.
Jimmy?	What the fuck are you doing here?	Do you remember me?	Yeah, I remember you.	"You Jimmy Grantz?							  *"	Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -	Don't say anything else.	I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -	Quiet!
Why?	I don't want blood on them.	Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?	Strip!	Look, there's two hundred grand stashed in the car. Just take it!
You think you can bargain with me?!	Take the money and walk away!	I don't want your fucking money!
You don't remember me.	Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -	You did explain, Lenny.
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.	You told me.
Yeah.	So you have information for me?	Is that what your little note says?	Yes.	Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear.
You know him?	No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
"Have I told you what this man did?				*"	Yes.	Then you shouldn't have to ask.	But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.	"* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *"	Tell me about her again.	Why?	Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.	"She was beautiful. Perfect to me -				*"
I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.	Deals?	It's isolated.	Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?	I wasn't helping you for money.	Sorry.
They treating you alright?	Don't remember.	You know what we have in common?
Sleep okay?	Yeah. You?
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.	Who is he? What have you got me into?
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.	That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!	Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
How do I know he did that to you?	I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.	So I just take your word?	Yes.	Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.	Did you?	What?	Kill him.	Course not.
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.	There are things you know for sure.	Such as?	I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.	Your wife?	She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
It's not easy to be calm when -	Just relax.
His name was Jimmy.	What happened?	He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.	Who did he go to meet?
What do the police think?	They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
Kill him.	"Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people."
Who?	Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
"I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything."	And what did he say?	He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.	Where is he?	What are you gonna do?	I'll go see him.	And?
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.	He'll kill you, Lenny.	My wife used to call me Lenny.	Yeah?	Yeah, I hated it.	This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?	I told him about your car.	Why would you do that?	He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
What's wrong?	Somebody's come. Already.	Who?	Calls himself Dodd.	What does he want?	Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.	Did you?	No!	What's this all about?
You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?	I have this condition -
What happened?	What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
Neither do I.	Don't protect him.	I'm not.	Help me.	How?	Get rid of Dodd for me.	What?	Kill him. I'll pay you.	What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.	What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?	That's different.
Don't talk about my wife.	I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
Calm down.	That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!	Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.	Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
Yes.	You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.	Shut the fuck up!
Don't say another fucking word!	About your whore of a wife?
"* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*"	Can I ask you something?
They're not looking for him.	Why not?
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?	"* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *"
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.	Thank you.
On the house.	Thanks.
My wife.	Sweet.	Dying.	What?	I remember my wife dying.
Beer, please.	What do you want?	A BEER, please.	"Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *"
There's a dress code?	What are you here for?	I'm meeting someone called Natalie.	Well, that's me.	Oh. But haven't we met before?
You tell me.	"I don't remember. See, I have no short-			* term memory. It's not amnesia -				   *"
You're the memory guy?	How do you know about me?	My boyfriend told me about you.	Who's your boyfriend?	Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.	Are you Teddy?	"My name's Leonard.							 *"	Did Teddy send you?	I don't know.
I don't know. I'm sorry.	You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
"I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before."	So why did you come here?
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -	"Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is ""faking"" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -"	I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.	We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.	I'm not appealing the decision.	Then why are you here?
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?	I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.	Thank you.	She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.
How can you read that again?	It's good.	You've read it a hundred times.	I enjoy it.	Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -	Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!	Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.	Teddy!
I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -	That's who you were, you don't know who you are.	Shut your mouth!	Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
"Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.			    *"	I guess I've told you about my condition.
This is your car.	You're in a playful mood.
What the hell you want to go there for?	You know it?	"Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?"	I don't remember.
Yup?	Mr Gammell?	Lenny, is that you?	John Gammell?	Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.	"I'll be waiting.							   *"
Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?	You said you were leaving town.	Things change.	So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.	Guess I've told you about my condition.	Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.	You don't have to remember to be hungry.	It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?	Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?	Who?	The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
Why?	Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.	Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?	Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.	Why?
You really want to find this guy?	He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.	You're living.	Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.	Probably left it in your room.
Why are you here?	You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
You don't know him?	No! Should I?
I don't think so.	Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?	I might have fallen asleep before I did.
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -	No. No, just let me think for a minute.
Natalie? Natalie who?	Why?
We've got to get him out of here.	He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.	We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.	How'd ya get him in here in the first place?	I don't know.
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.	Fucking hope not.
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.	Shut it, Teddy.	Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.	I'll ride with him. You follow.	Give me your keys.
So was he scared?	Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.	What's wrong with this one?	You like it? Let's trade.
So what are you gonna do now?	I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.	Natalie who?
Who the fuck are you?	Teddy. Your buddy.	Prove it.	Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
Unfinished business.	Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.	Who's she?
Why's that?	Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake.
"What do you mean ""bad news""?"	She's involved with these drug dealers.
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.	From who?	Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.	Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?	She couldn't.	Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
She has no idea who I am.	Why are you following me?	I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
Happy now?	I won't be happy until you leave town.	Why?	How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?	What sort of questions?	The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.	Like what?	Like how'd you get this car? That suit?	I have money.
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.	So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -	That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
I didn't sell -	I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.	Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.	Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town.
How'd you know I was in here?	The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
Why?	Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.	Why not?

Yeah.	What's your twenty?	Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...	Turn around.	We know these people...!	Grieve elsewhere.
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.	I was the kids' godfather.	And...?	"""And"" what?"	"I got to know.  There is never any room for ""personal""..."
Sal Maguda.	He any good?	Oh, yeah...	So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
With Sonny.  110%.	Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
They'll kill Gina.	They may have already, so we protect the living.  Proof she's alive?
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?	There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...	Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...	Recruit us to do what?
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.	Good.
Okay.  What'd you spot...?	Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
Yeah?	José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.	Where's the new drop point...?	They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...	What do you think?	It's a rip and a hit.	Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...	You can't.
Just came in.  She's still alive.	Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
We're not certain...	You said Nazi Low-riders...?	We're not certain!
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.	Tell them what you want.	They knew about Alonzo, <u>before</u> he made a move on them.  They had our operation.  They've cut into us.
You need to consider a few issues.	...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...	Sure.	I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.	Of course.  From my side, I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it...  So let me know if we're on...
I don't know.	Yes you do...	I got to talk to my ADO...	No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?
So...?	Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.	All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.	"Okay.  You got the ""item""?"	I got the item.	And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.	How many?	Two main players plus three.	My end?	25% discount on the load.	Make it 40%.	Make it 35.	Deal.
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.	Really?  So, what is this, a party?
I thought we had to meet the Man.	You do.	When?	Right now.
We want it back.	Okay.	What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
"What's ""nothing""?"	"Nothing.  As in ""free, gratis."""
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...	And what is that?
What do you like to drink?	I'm a fiend for mojitas.
How fast does that go?	It goes very fast.	Show me...?
So where's the best place for mojitas?	Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...	Where's that?	Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...	The Keys?	Havana.	Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...	Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...	You do business in Cuba with your husband?	I never do business in Cuba.  And nobody goes to Cuba but me.  And he is not my husband...
Were you born in Havana?	Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...	Where's she now?	She's dead...
Your father?	Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
How's he not your husband?	I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
Mojitas...?	Later!  Do you dance?	I dance...
Tell <u>me</u> everything.	No.	I insist.	Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?	Died in childbirth, having me...	To mothers.  And all that we owe them...
You know how improbable this is...?	"""Probable""...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here."	...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.	That's right.	...and therafore there is no consequence?	Exactly.
Like...?	"Like ""three thousand a ki?""  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers."	And why should continuing excellence cost more?	Cost less.  That's the point.	Is it December?	What do you mean?	Did Christmas come early this year...?	"Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  ""And why,"" you're thinking, ""would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?""  And the answer is, ""of course"" but also ""no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."""	Good samba dancing...?	Zero risk.	'Cause you don't lose loads?	'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.	And you're our thirty-percent partner?
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.	I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...	Available cash is not an issue for us...	Twenty-eight-point-five.	What if I pushed to twenty-one...?	I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...	Maybe I'm only one.
Hola, chica.	Hola, viejo.
I forgot the napkins.	And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?	What's the best fortune you ever got?	"They're all the same.  ""Financial security is around the corner."" ""Your friends love you."""	"In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, ""Live now because life is dust."""
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?	Why?	...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.	Do I need it?	Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.	'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...	Really?	Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.	When?	Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner.
Would you find me...?	Of course.	Where would I go?	Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...	Is this the protective male talk?	This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.	And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?	A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.	Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load...
...in the morning.	I'll be on board by noon.
Yero, by himself?	Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
If they attack you...	...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?	No.
No part of it wasn't real.	I know.  And now?	It still is.  I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up... All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you.  Just like I said.  And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will.
José...	Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.	Sit.
What...?	Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
You afraid of violence?	"I am not John Wayne.  There is no ""S"" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money."
Red light, green light, José?	"I'm also called ""Cochi Loco.""  That means ""Crazy pig.""  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me..."
"Client got delivery.  But there were...""extras"" in the back of the truck."	"""Extras"" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of ""Things Aquatic""?"	I do.  We don't do business with him...	"He tried to...""do business""...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there."	I'll be there.
Yeah.	And what do I do with him?
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?	What'd Neptune tell you?	He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?	Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
Packaging?	Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Yeah?	Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
You got something to say, José, let's hear it.	I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
What friend?	Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?	'Cause she will tell you.
What's our deal?	Backup in case the Russians get physical.	How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?	Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
And there's Dmitri...	The honey trap.  And there's the honey.	Hello, Miss Ukraine...
What is it?	Alonzo...	Stevens?	Something's wrong.
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.	White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...	Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
"Track with me, here...  They knew the ""Russians"" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?"	"It says, ""We do not fear you.""  It says, ""Fuck off and die.""  It says, ""We get down for recreation..."""
So?	We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.	That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
"People gonna walk into this place and say, ""Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"""	"""No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."""	So we can close each other's eyes right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.  But, then, nobody makes any money...
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.	What kind of weight?
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.	"What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  ""In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami.""  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.

Because when money and guns get together, there is violence...
Then it don't work.	What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
Anything?	Nothing.
Where we meeting 'em...?	Port-Au-Prince.
What do we got?	Five minutes...
They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?	Who knows...
To the limit.	You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?	Like...?	Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?	No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?	No.	Good.  So let's go...
How much we looking for?	Nothing.
Where the hell are you, man?	On my way back...
Where'd you go?	Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.	Where?	Verdado.	Verdado where?	It's in the suburbs outside Havana.	Havana, Cuba...?	No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?	...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?	No.	You're not makin' a move on her...?	We're makin' moves on each other.	Oh, that makes it okay, then.
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...	And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?	Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...
"Their loads are poly-drug.  ""E"" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan ""H."" Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network."	And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.	So we want to change-up the mission statement.
Hey, fuck him.	Chill out Sonny.	We're the ones doing the death- defying shit?  And he wants us to give that up?  For what? A chump-change bust so he can get his picture in <i>The Miami Herald</i> to impress the slug farm in DC...
What is going on...?!	As in...?	"There is ""undercover.""  And there is ""Which way is up?"""	You think I am in so deep I forgot?	I am asking.  You to me.	Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?	I would never doubt you.
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...	And José, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
What's your take?	What's the point?  It's going down.	"Call the US Coast Guard:  ""Come and arrest our ass.""  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine..."
Eleven to seven he blows it.	Twenty on my man...	You're giving away your money, fool...
Go ahead.	Too fast.  Too many moving parts.	Switek?
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...	Then you should.	If you're down, we're down for the play.
Hello?	This is Agent James Fujima.	Detective Crockett.	What's your Miami PD badge number?	4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.	Okay.  What's up?	A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...	How do I discuss operations over an open line?	"How do I know?  I got the call from Alonzo on an open line.  That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment, at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert you, here.  <u>You</u> know whether or not...you have a thing goin' down.  I do not.  But we know this guy.  I think you know this guy.  Normally, he is cool.  Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical.  That engenders foreboding.  Do you understand the meaning of the word ""foreboding""? As in badness is happening to <u>your</u> deal right fucking now?"
"Guy's involved in a ""meet""..."	"""Buy and walk""?  ""Buy and bust""? ""Reverse undercover""?  What?"	"Meet and greet.  ""I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"""	And the deal goes down at another place at another time.	That's right.	...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?	NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
How?	We don't know.
So what do you want?	To recruit you.
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...	How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
From whom...?	A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.	Never heard of him.	From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
"Who said, ""go exploring""?  We want this staying on track."	"Who's the ""we""?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  ""Low-level producer.""  Yeah, right..."	What are you talking about?	Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
Out of...?	Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
Control your men.	I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
"This I gotta see...  ...the ""make up an excuse and stop"" part."	Have faith.	I have faith.  In horoscopes and fortune cookies...
"""Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."""	Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...	How will it stand up?	If they ran the rental car or lease on this place...even if it's EPIC database in El Paso...they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep.  Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves...
Yeah...?	Sonny...?	Yeah.	Where's Riccardo?	On the phone.	I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...	Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?	They had me from the gate.	I don't understand...
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.	Alonzo, what's goin' on?!	After I check on Francine and the boys, then I'm gone.  Sonny, tell Rico I'm so sorry.  I wanted you to know...
Where are you?	...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!	Alonzo...!	Goodbye.
How'd they get onto you?	How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.	Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?	White supremacist types.
Oh, good...	...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
C'mon, man!	We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?	We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.	As in, your ass is dead in the water.	But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?	They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
Who are you talking to?	He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
So?	Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
"Only African he ever ""relocated"" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him..."	He did volunteer one time...
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?	Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
You okay?	Yeah.	You sure?	Yes.  What's up?	Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?	Bored.
Okay...see you soon.	...and thanks for the flowers.	What flowers?	The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
You mean with the flowers...?	What's it say?	"""Salutations from the south..."""
Okay.	Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
"...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, ""We can reach out and touch somebody.""  Like Bad Teleflora."	...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...	...you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious, they make mistakes. You're worried about me.  Do not be.  I am careful.  I am cool.  I got Trudy, backup, whatever.  You worry about you.  Because you are the ones who are in denied territory, not me.  If your focus is on me, you'll miss something coming at you.  That's how people slip up. Get hurt.  And I'd die if anything happened.  You worry about <u>you</u>. You and Sonny...are in the dangerous place.  I'm fine...
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...	Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?	Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.	Not French registry?	They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.	José doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.	But what does your intuition tell you...?
And...?	They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
Why?	A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...	What would you do...?	I like the diminished risk.  It frees up capital reserves.  I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent.  You can predict their behavior....
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.	Define small.	Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
And as an investment in the future...	"""Future"" of...?"
Conveyance?	Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
That sonofabitch!	You set this up!	Of course!  That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.	Meaning...?	They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.
So lay it out, my brother...	Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good?
Equipment?	Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?	Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
What do you care?	Do we need this...?
Then what were we talking to you for?	I had to lay eyes on you.
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?	Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
This the load you lost a while back?	It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.	You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.	Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...	<u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads...
Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...	You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
What the hell did you do?	The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...
I gotta, I gotta go...!	Alonzo...	What...?	Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...	They lied.
Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty...	You're hoping to get a look at what?	The Statue of Liberty.	It's up in Central Park, taking a leak. If you hurry, you'll make the supper show. Now get lost.
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.	Hers'n zodda meg a livig.	Beg pardon, ma'am?	Said, a person's gotta make a living.	You sure you heard what I said?	Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.	Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
You ain't coming to work?	Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
What you gonna do back there, East?	Lotta rich women back there...	Yeah?	Men, they mostly faggots.	Must be some mess back there.	Well, ain't no use hanging around here.	Ain't gonna collect your pay?	I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?	Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!	I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...	You sure are a pretty lady.
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.	No, ma'am, I'm not.	Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
I can tell, can't you?	Yeah, oh yeah.	What'll we do? Leave now or what? Your place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you?
He's got taxi fare.	Sure you're all right?
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?	Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
You think I'm lying!	No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?	I ain't sleepy.	I know. Scribbage!
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.	What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.	If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.	Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!
There's an E in MONEY. If that's your word.	M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.	Okay. Never argue with a man.	Y -- what in hell starts with Y?
Cut it out. That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you!	You gonna beat me, Joe?	Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!	Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?	I show you what problem --
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?	Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
Shee-it...  Kee-rist, you really know the ropes. Wish to hell I bumped into you before. I'm Joe Buck from Texas and I'm gonna buy you a drink, what do you say to that?	Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.	Same all around! For my friend, too!
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!	For what?	For money.	For money for what?	I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?	How would I know? You gotta tell a person these things  A hustler? Picking up trade on the street like that -- baby, believe me -- you need management.	I think you just put your finger on it, I do.	My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird right now?	Well, Joe, you're a nice guy, and I'd be doing you both a favor, but why? What'm I dragging my bum leg all over town for? It's no picnic and what for, for me myself, what?
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.	Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...	Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...	Oh hell, forget it.	Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...	Forget it.	I mean, dammit, where you live?
What's in your socks?	Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.	It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
You want some free medical advice, shut your goddam mouth about that night.	Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!	I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.	You inviting shee-it.
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.	Whatsa matter now?
You don't seem like no fag...	What's that supposed to mean?
What for?	So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.	Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?	I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?	Oh. Guess I got the wrong impression.
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?	Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?	I'm impressed. You're a killer.	So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know.
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.	Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.	Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.	Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.	This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?	I been sick. Hold this, will ya?
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?	I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.	What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.	You talk like a man with a tin twat.
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?	Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.	And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.	You like it? Take a look.	Don't rush me. How I do it, see, I get myself primed, like I was turning on the charm for some pretty little blonde lady, then kinda mosey away slow and easy and - swing around! -- and there you are, you handsome devil.
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.	What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies?	The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.	Who'd you ever do a favor for? You just let some poor bastard freeze to death, wouldn't you?
Where'd that come from?	Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?	You wanna know the truth? You dumb bastard, I got it for you. Look at it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me.
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.	The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.	Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.	Can he smell the difference, eh?
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.	He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.	Yeah, well, so?	Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?	What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.	Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...	Don't say nothing about you either.	But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.	Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
You got a comb?	Don't need a comb.	Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess.
Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...	Rico. Rico Rizzo.
Tell her, Ratso.	Twenty bucks...
Well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister. Can you walk or not?	Walk? Naturally I can walk.
They wrong?	No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.	You couldn't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl. Can you hold this?
But thanks.  Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise?	Yeah.	Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...	And what?	I'm scared.	What of?	What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!	Who?	I don't know. Cops. Or the -- how should I know?
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.	No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.	Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?	I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.	You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?	I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.	Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.	I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
These guys're good drivers.	They gotta be.	Yeah.
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.	How'n hell a dumb Bronx kid like you know that?	I read it.	Shee-it. You believe all you read?
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?	I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?	Keep the goddam blanket on.	I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?	Sounds like they knew you.	Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?
Hey -- whatsa matter?	I'm wet.	You're what?	I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.	Hell, don't cry about it!	Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
I'm falling apart, that's funny?	You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
Hey, what the hell you doing?	I'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think I'm doing?
Thanks, Joe.	Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up...	Gin's okay.	It's so exciting. New York. The mad forward thrust of everything. My sense of time here is completely altered.
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?	What?
What d'you want?	What?	What you got me up here for?	Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.	You want me to leave?	No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.	I'm going to Florida.	This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
Listen, I gotta have money.	Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
Here. Don't even thank me.	I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.	I simply don't have it, Joe.	Get outta my way.	You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there.
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?	No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.	Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.	You bet I do, sir.	But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.	Well, not too, I mean, a little.
I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.	Yessir, I can see that.	Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.	Well, uh, I'm raring to go.	Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?	Uh, yessir.	Ready for hard work, son?	Ready for anything.	I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.	Gonna be like money from home.	Money from home, see, there's your strength, you put things in earthy terms any man can understand, son. I warn you I'm gonna use you, I'm gonna run you ragged!
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?	Get down -- where?	Right here, why not? I prayed in saloons, I prayed in the street, I prayed an the toilet. He don't care where, what He wants is that prayer.
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...	Instant V-goddam-D.	This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?	Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?	You got it.	No. You got it.
You really want to do business?	Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Sold. Let's go.	... and taxi fare for me.	Get lost.	I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?	Is he all right!
Getchmis olsun	Getchmis...?	"Olsun - ""May it pass quickly."" I'm Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich something Swedish."
Looks like a cheap hotel.	Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
'Figgers.	...He had a bald skull and...	Hamidou.  Chief of the Guards. Don't fuck with him. He almost killed an Italian dude couple months ago.  Bad news. He try anything with you?
The kids? Why are they...	Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
Yeah.	History, man, history. How much?	Two kilos.	Where?	The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.	Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.	Twenty months?	Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
Years?	Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
Tunnel?	It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.	We go through the wall?
You got that, shit face? Asina...	KNOCK IT OFF!
It's there!	What?	Listen!
Want me to take over?	You want to split your hernia again?
What?	How's your hernia?	Don't make me laugh.
Anybody bitten?	Nah, just covered with batshit!	They went out over there: must be some kind of exit.
Who?	Ziat!
To what?	The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
Too bad you didn't have a machine.	There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.	Stop shitting me, man!
"--the water like ""'weeps"" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three."	And what do you do when you in the catacombs?	The catacoombs?  Whaddya want, a door?  There's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in Istanbul.
Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean...  ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.	Shit.	Billy?
Haps, railroad, bus timetables?	Everything.
Dad...I'm...	...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?	Yeah. How's Mom?	Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...	No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?	Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.	Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.	Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
Where'd you get that limp?	Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
Where you staying, Dad?	The Hilton.	How do you like it?  Istanbul?	Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
Why'd you do it, Billy?	For the money... )	I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.	I know.
DAD!	Oh Jesus!
You know where they are?	Sure.	How far?	About ten kilometers.	Sixty Lira?	Sixty?
Those mountains? are they?	Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?	Not far. Just a little way.	No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.	I'll pay extra	How much?
Where are the minefields?	All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?	Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.	Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are
No, I'm not afraid.	Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?	Yes...?	Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?	A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.	Would you recognize him again?	Yes.  I think so.	Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.	Stupid.	Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...	But didn't have heroin.
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.	But just...	Just what?	I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
...are you with the Consulate?	Something like that. Cigarette?
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?	Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.	How much did you figure to make?
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.	Beats working.	I was just going to sell it to friends.  I'm not a pusher, honest.
Got a family back there?	Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.	What's your father do?	He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.	Be tough on 'em.
Girlfriend?	...She was on the plane.
She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.	Lucky girl.
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.	Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so.
How's it feel?	About as good as it looks.
Just Erich.	I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
Feeling all right?	Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
New people sometimes get on his nerves.	What did he do?
And you?	Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
What they give you?	Twelve years.
How much did you have?	A hundred grams.	It's not fair!
"There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all ""sula-bula"" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months..."	That doesn't seem so bad.	But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.	He wasn't even in the car?	Aslan, there...
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.	How long?	Seven years...
Hello, Billy.	Hello.
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.	Thank you.
What's wrong?	Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.	What do you mean?	The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.	And?	We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!	Billy!  Please!
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...	What do you mean?	Get the... midnight... express.	What's that?
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?	I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.	Section 13?
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...	Where is it?	I don' t know. It's someplace down in there....  ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....
You got your stuff?	Yeah.
Okay?	Yeah!	Jimmy?
What time is it?	Two thirty.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!	It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
We go back.	What?  You gotta be joking.	We go back, seal it up again, and come in tomorrow night - every night 'till we get out of here. There's gotta be a way. Those bats got out someplace.  Now let's go.  Doubletime!
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!	Yeah.	I got some acid man.  Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something.
Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.	Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?	What?	After we're outside the kogus?	Oh we... we...	Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
What?	Cut his fucking throat.	Whose?	ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it.
Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.	I want to cut his throat.	It's already been cut.	Then I'll cut his balls off.
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.	You know where it is?	What?	I know where it is.
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.	Yeah? Where?
Hishradyo.	Max - where?	His radio Back of his open, radio...
Just got some news on Bell.	What?	Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.	Oh shit.
Why the suit?	Maybe he's changing jobs.
I think I've been poisoned.	And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.	Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up.
Never was anybody like you...	You can't take anything seriously.	You're right.
Billy, what's the matter?	My passport!	No!
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.	What is it? . . . Billy?	For Christ's sake, just GET on the plane, okay!
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.	Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
What is it with you man, what the hell is it?	Cat, ah!  Ayip!	You're ayip!	Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?	But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.	I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.	Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
Know what?	Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.	Learn what?
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.	That's a great philosophy.	You 'Merican.  You don't know.
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!	Work, work, work, that's all do	I don't hear you bitch about the money.
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.	Mr. Yesil.	I know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge,  I arrange everything - just right.  And I think we get you bail. If very bad, maybe twenty month sentence... But I think we get you bail...
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back.	If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
What'd the Prosecutor say?	It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.	Did you ask for bail?
Lawyers?	Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
His name?	Who?	The lawyer?
What lawyer?	Who got the Frenchman out?	Oh Yesil...  Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil...
Hey, you can't...	What's your name?	Jeremy...	Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?	Lady...	Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
"The blintzes!  ""Try the blintzes..."""	Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...	Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.	"Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell ""Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"""
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?	Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure.	Immigration's gonna love you for that.	Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?	Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...	Shit.
Peter...	Yeah...?	There's some weird shit here.	Weird shit...?	Take a look.
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.	New York's finest.
There's really people living down here?	Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street...
Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.	What?	Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're usually around.
Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.	H-how do I get...?	Way we came.  Take the first tunnel to your right...
Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?	I think so. One right, two lefts...	And a right.	Right.
Look, I showed you my badge...	Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...	The Department of Public Health...	...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...	Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?	Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.	No, you talkin' at me.
For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?	You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
We'll be back at the platform in...	20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.	20 minutes.  Susan?
Did you see the size of that thing?!	Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
Oh, that's gonna work.	You got a better way up?
Any luck?	Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?	Oh, man, there you go again.	What?	Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?	All right, motherfucker, that's it.
I only got...	Just do it!
Wait a minute-	Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
Its muscles are locked.	Oh, Jesus!!
You feel anything?	Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...	Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...	Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?	I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
A mistake.	"""Mistake""?  What's that supposed to...?"	It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.	How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
Is there a switch?	Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
Can we get this car there?	Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?	Depends.  You got a memo?
The kid...	The kid's with them!!	What do you-?	Go!! Just go!!
He's special.	He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
My God, what the hell are you...?	Hurry, the woman needs help!
What are you doing down here?	Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!	Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
The lights come up, you pull the switch.	I pull.	You don't do that, we're on the wrong track.  You...
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.	Nino, please...
What are you putting that crap on me for?	Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
But the power...	Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.	Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
He didn't do it!	What?	Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin' the wrong way!!!
Which way?	Across both tracks!!
We're no leaving you!	No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
Just inner chambers...	But it look like a man. It... I saw it.	No...
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...	"""...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."""	This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...	Manny...	I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...	We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
A shame.  You looked great tonight.	Please.	You did!
Do you think we did the right thing?	Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?	You know what I mean...
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...	Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.	"We're down to a ""couple"" now, huh?"
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.	Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.	Don't get kinky here...
Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.	I'll be late.
Thought it was my week for that.	I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!	Okay. So you lost a great specimen-	Don't you get it? It's more than that.
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.	We?
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...	Maybe they lied to you.	Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
Metaxonycha Godmani.	So?
Honey, just leave it.	No, there's...
You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?	I heard how you talked to him.	Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
He was just doing his job.	Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
Great crowd.	No such thing, baby.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.	Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.	Right.
Oh, no, you were-	I was just late.
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...	Susan, we're not b-
...you don't even know what you're looking for.	You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...	Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...	No.
Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri...	It didn't bite me.	I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
It's me. Can you hear me?	Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
Don't.	Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
No, Jesus, no.	Toss the flare down!
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...	That's camouflage...
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!	How?!
It's no use! They know we're in here!	They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!	Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
Rub it on the windows!	What-	Just do it!!
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!	Peter-	It worked before...	The scent won't last...	That's why we should do it now.
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...	Try not to sweat?
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...	That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
Oh, come on, come on!	Jump in.
You go first. I'll be right below you.	Your arm, you can't...	I can.  We can do this...
C'mon...	Ah...	Talk to me.	Peter...
No...	We can do it!
Hello.	You the bug lady, right?
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?	That's it?
You sure you didn't see one of these?	Gross. What is it?	"An ""Ootheca"". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh ""weirdbugs"" inside."	No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...	Just like Trump Tower, then.
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.	I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.	Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.	I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...	What?	She used a baster.
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.	Oh, Jesus.
What's this?	Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy.
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?	What is it?	I have no idea.  Are you ready?
It bit you.	No shit.
This wing configuration. I've never...	Fuck! It broke the skin...	And they're not fully developed.  This thing's not even an adult.
My God.	What?
That's impossible.  Insects don't...	I know.  Help me get a sample.
Oh, my!	Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.	Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?	I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.	What do you want to know?	Anything you can tell me might help.
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...	I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.	Thank you.
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?	Sure.	It's right this way.
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.	I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.	I'm not much of a critic.	Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?	Sure.	How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?	Sounds good.
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.	I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.	You got a point there...
Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.	But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.	I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.	How long...?	You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--	--my number one fan.
Here.	What are they...?	They're called Novril--they're for your pain.
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?	The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down.
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.	Will I be able to walk?	Of course you will. And your arm will be fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but I finally popped it back in there.  But what I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs. Considering what I had around the house, I don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better.
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.	Following me?
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.	Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--	Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.	I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.	Lucky for you, I did.  Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels...
You're very kind...	And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done.
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.	It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe...	You want to read it?	If you wouldn't mind.	I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.	You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
What's your new book called?	I don't have a title yet.	What's it about?	"It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but ""Misery"" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title."	Oh, like I could do that?
But what?	Nothing.	No, what is it?	Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?	I can take it, go ahead.	Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.	Pretty rough so far.	The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.	The profanity bothers you?	It has no nobility.	Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid, everybody talks like that.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.	It's fine.
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.	Then the roads are open...	The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.	The phones are working?	Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...	My daughter must be going nuts.	...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.	I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.	Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.	I guess that means it's okay.	"No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would ""great"" be insulting?"	"I can live with ""great."""
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.	Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.	I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?	You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
Thank you so much.	My pleasure.
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.	Misery?
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.	I'm getting to believe you.	This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.	She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...	I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?	The Sistine Chapel?	Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world...
For a while I thought I might go crazy.	I know how that can be.	I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems.  'Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too.
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.	I'm...	Done?	Yeah, thanks.	No problem.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.	Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.	It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.	Well, I hope you like it.	Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?	Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--	I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!	I DIDN'T...	Then who did?	No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.	She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?	Perfect.	You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.	I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?	I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.
"But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said ""I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."""	Show me the way?	Yes.
You want me to burn my book?	Yes.	You want me to burn my book?	I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.	This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.
Then light the match, Paul.	No big deal.	So you've indicated. Do it.
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.	You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.	Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.	You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.	As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?	I don't know.	Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?	Great.
See, isn't this nice?	Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.	And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.	If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.	Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.
Set what up?	That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.	Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?	Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
Misery's Return?	I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...	You just expect me to whip something off, that it?	I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.	You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.	Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.	Great.
"And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an ""n."" I told the saleslady ""n"" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name."	It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.	You--fooler...!  Did I do good?	You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.	But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.	C'mere, I'll show you.
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?	I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.	Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?	No, just the paper will be fine.	Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.	Annie, what's the matter?	"What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? ""You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie."" Well, I'll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man."
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?	You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.	Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.	I want my pills NOW!	It'll only take a second.	I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...
Here, in case you think of any ideas.	Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.	Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.	"What? What happened to ""I'll treasure whatever you do?"""	Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.	I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.	Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.	--not fair?	That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...	--cliff-hangers--	"I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, ""This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"""
"""HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"""	They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.	"But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any ""experimental blood transfusion"" that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there."
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.	I can't write this anymore.	Don't be silly. Of course you can.	I'm telling you, I can't.	"You can--you have the ""gotta""--"	The what?	"The ""gotta."" Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the ""gotta."""	I said that?	"You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, ""I 'gotta' know will she live,"" ""I 'gotta' know will he catch the killer."" ""I gotta see how this chapter ends."" You said it. I don't usually buy that magazine. I only got it, 'cause they were interviewing you."
What about a bee...?	What?	Nothing.
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?	You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!	Yeah, yeah...
"Oh, Paul, can I read each chapter when you finish? I can fill in the ""n""s.  Will she be her old self, now that Ian has dug her out, or will she have amnesia...?"	...have to wait.	Will she still love him with that special perfect love?	Have to wait.	Not even a hint?
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?	Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?	I'm going to play my records all day
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.	Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
I hope you like it.	It looks wonderful. And so do you.	Oh...
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?	My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.	Oh.  You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.
Annie, I think we should have a toast.	A toast?	Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine.
To Misery.	Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?	Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look.
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?	Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.	Well, it certainly says you.	You really think so?	Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.
Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do?	It's perfect.
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?	To Misery.
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.	I think you're right.
Annie, what is it?	The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.	Why would you lose me?	The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.	Why would I want to leave? I like it here.	That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.	It is.
Paul, I know you've been out.	What?	You've been out of your room.	No, I haven't.	Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.	I don't know what you're talking about.
Now don't fuss, Paul.	Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.	I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.	Don't talk to me like that.	Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.	Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?	Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...	I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--	Be my guest.	That's disgusting.
I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.	But the time is now. Soon others will come.	It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.	Three more chapters to go.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?	Maybe.	This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?	Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.	I'm glad you like it.	Paul, this will be our legacy.	It will.
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.	You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.	What things?	You don't know?	I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.	Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
Yes, Paul.	I'm almost done.	Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?	You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.	Ahh!!!
Did I do good?	You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
We actually got a phone call. Busy morning.	Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?	Four or five days ago. Why?
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.	Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
Stop--stop right here.	What? What is it?
Could be the weight of the snow.	Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
You really think Sheldon's out there?	Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?	Just from his agent.
You don't think he's dead, do you?	He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.	It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.	There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.	Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.	Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.	What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?	Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice.
"""There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him."""	What?	They're hauling Misery into court.	That's nice.	"""There is a justice higher than that of man--I will be judged by Him."""
Just leave it, all right?	Oh, I like that tone.	How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?	What thing?	That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.	What is it?	I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.	It's good you found it.	There's that spice again.
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.	Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?	Yes.	He's your client, huh?	Yes, he is.
People sure like those Misery books.	I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books.	Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.	Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?	I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels?
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...	You think he might be missing?	I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.	G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.	Maybe you can, Libby.	No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.	No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?	I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.	So do I...	I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.	I'm sure you're right.
Hey, Pete.	Buster.	Answer me a couple things?	If I can.	Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?	We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.	You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?	Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
Has she been buying any odd things lately?	Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.	Newspapers?	No, the typing kind.	Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.	It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.	When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.	You're still a writer.	I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--	Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.	Marcia, please.	No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.	"Marcia, you know I started ""Misery"" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here."	"I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, ""Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study."	Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness?  I'm doing this because I have to.  Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ...  I might just have something that I want on my tombstone.
Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd...	Did they win?	Yeah. They're in the semis.	Here it is.  Very first copy.
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.	That'd be a first.	And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.	Great.	I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.	I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.	Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.	Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.	Now you've hurt me, Paul.
I thought you were over it.	I am. Well, maybe not completely--
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..	All done, chief..	- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -	Not possible..
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?	From her point of view or mine?	Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.	Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you?	Sean, please..
I thought you were going to dinner.	Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.	Where is it?	In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.	Hugh, I'm impressed..
Not much luggage.	I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.	How grateful?	Well that depends.	On what.	How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?	How I usually find you, Nyah.	How do you that.	Magic...	Ahh..
Your room.	Mmmm.	And my room?
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.	Oh, I am.  Later..
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.	Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.	Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
You won.	I suppose I did.	What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.	'Thief in the Night?'	Say no more.  I'm off to grab a drink. Still favor Bellinis?
See anything you like?	Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
To win?	What else?
You picked another winner!	Well, that's good, isn't?
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.	Then don't say it.	I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.	To do what?	Sort it all out.	And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.	A change of plans?	Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.	Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.	Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.	Lovely.
Feel like pleading for your life?	Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?	If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.	What are you talking about?	In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz.  G'day.
Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.	Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.	What are you talking about?	An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>	Where?	In downtown Sydney for a start.
Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.	Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.
Nyah!	Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.	Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
Fight a bit of a cold..	And you're happy about that?	Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.	You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.	I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.	I knew where it was.	Oh.  then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the CDC scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective.  You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for.
There it is, guys, the last of it.	Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.	What was the top bid?	Why, you going to make me a better offer?	Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.	Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl.
She doesn't belong here, Sean.  Let her go.	She wouldn't  be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt.  from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me.  Ball's in your court, Hunt.  What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer.
Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions..	In other words, you're calling her a flake.
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..	It's that time.  Go.
Not exactly.  Wallis?	More like two-two point two million.	In any case we don't want your cash.
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..	Ninety-three point four million.	Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty.
Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.	It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
What you got there, mate?	A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?	Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..	..or hard wired..	- or hard wired, right.  First line of perimeter defence'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house. Whatever moves burps or bleep is gonna be picked up to a height of twenty feet. Basically impenetrable, I'd say.
Well do you disagree with that?	Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?	Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.
Ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar. Big bloke, ginger hair. They're into something.	I'll be damned.  It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO.
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.	What are you talking about?	Unless we dose her with Bellerophon on the next ninety-seven minutes, Nyah will kill herself.  So, first things, first. Swanbeck said there's no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts.
It is, Billy.	Then we got'em!
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.	What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.	There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...	I'm not ready!
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?	Exactly where is she?	..in the building...
Before we kill her or cure her..	Right.
We're due to take off.	Not for seven more minutes.
Range is two kay.	I hope there's a place to land.
There she is.  I got visual.	We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
That's it?  That's it? That's it?	And the check's in the mall.	Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.	He's heading down the stairs, now..
Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'	I am. She is.
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.	How much longer before you can reach him?	Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
How're we doin', then?	He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.	What can we do' mate?	Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
Do you know me?	No.  Should I?	No.  You just looked as if you did.	No.  Just as if I'd like to.	Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.	Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -	There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.	What if I pay the rent?	Uh-huh.	Uh-huh?
What are you doing here?	Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?	I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
Would you mind if I'm on top?	Oh, either way works for me.
- right..where is it?	Far right.
Where's the bloody -	- torque wrench.	- this is very disconerting..	Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.	- right..
I wouldn't do that.	Do what?
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?	Indeed.	Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer.  we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.	At least you walked.	If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?	Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.	May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?	Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.	Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..	You didn't do that badly.
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..	Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Hola..	Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?	Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!
Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen..	Listen to what?	I need your help and I thin you can use mine.	Your help?  What are you talking about?	Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.	Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
What's you name?	Ethan Hunt.	Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?
Awfully short notice..	Care to wait a decent interval?	Who wants to be decent?..
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.	Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.	They've got a book for this?	They've got a book for everything.	The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.	Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.	That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.	Which is?	That they're lying.
So where did I got right?	You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..	I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..	So do I.  Sort of.
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?	Of what?
Ask a question, you get an answer!..	Damn, you're beautiful.	That's because I'm on my back.
What's the population of Seville any idea?	Five, six-hundred thousand.	There's nearly 2 million in London.	And six billion in the world.	That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?	Sean Ambrose, for one.
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'	This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.	But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.	I'd like a little more conviction..	So would I.  But it's not mine to give.	You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?	Something like that.
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.	You can be a thief and have a conscience.	No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this!  What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid?	I don't.	Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?	Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.	And that's the only reason?	Can you think of a better one?	Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.	Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?	Much.	Then feel better!..
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.	What wouldn't make him suspicious?	Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.	This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.	Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..	Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
Before you are.	How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.	You don't trust me.	Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.	He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.	Yes?	You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.	Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.	Well, forewarned is forearmed.  And while we're at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose's plans, especially any involving you..
How's it going?  Everything okay?	Just like old times.	Just like old times?	Just about..
We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..	- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.	Have you met them?	Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.	I've no doubt.
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?	Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
-- his left jacket pocket.	Affirmative.
Where do I meet you?	Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?	I'll muddle through.
I managed.	You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
I want <i>you out of there.</i>	Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.	Ethan, tell me -
I want you out of Australia!  ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.	How do you suggest I go about it?	He's touched your heart.  You're overwhelmed.  You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month.  If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out.  Give me the ear piece.
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!	Oh Ethan!..
Are you okay?	I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.	It's going to be okay.
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?	Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..	What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.	No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
What did you think you were doing!	I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
- you who don't have a conscience.	I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?	No.	Then you'll have to kill me before it's too late.  Before I start killing people.	No.	I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
No.  Should I?	No.  You just looked as if you did.	No...
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.	Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.	Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.	Why did you phrase it like that?	Like what?	'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'	You gotta be kidding.
An idea, yeah.	Like?	Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?	Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?	You were there.
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?	Twice.	What did you think of him?	You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?	Not necessarily.
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.	Then you do think it was Ambrose.
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.	Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.	The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
Right now only Ambrose knows that.	In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.	In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.	- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.	'Terrorists?'	Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.	If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -	- is where Miss Hall comes in.	Excuse me?	Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.	And then what?	Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.	You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.	Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.	She's got no training for this kind of thing.	Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
I don't think I can get her to do it.	You mean it'll be difficult.	Very.	Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i>  Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.  If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try.  Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.	We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.	We think we've got our finger on the buyer.	Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.	Yes, I believe that's right.	But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.	You mean that leaves Miss Hall.	Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.	She sacrificed herself..	Brave girl.  If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice.  But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her.  After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law.  And Hunt.  However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera.  Bring it back alive.
Something else?	Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?	No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And neither can you, Hunt..
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?	You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.	Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.	I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.	Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.	Yes, I gathered as much.	And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.	Yes.	And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.	Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.	But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.	By fire.  That's the best way, really.
No, I don't.  But in this case -	In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.	I do.	Where is she now, by the way?  Do you know?	I don't.  No exactly.	Well, Hunt, what are your plans?	Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.	Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor..	Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.	They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.	I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.	Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.	Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?	Yes, he knew.  Just..	..not in time to save him.	No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.	You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
..I'm fine..and you?	I'm fine..
It's the transponder.	Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.	The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do.
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.	That simple, huh?	Why not?
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.	Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
Nekhorvich's boss?	Yep.
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...	Left jacket pocket?	Roger that.	Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.	Left jacket pocket confirmed.	Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.	She must still be on the property.	I told her to get outta there.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.	Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.	I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.	You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..	Nyah still on the property?
Let's start from the inside out.	All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
Now how to get in there.	No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.	I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
Luther, I'm looking at security.	Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?	Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
Luther, say again.	She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.	Copy.  She's only got twenty-eight minutes left.  Track ahead and pick her up.
So what did he say?	Good job.  And thanks.
A visit from an old friend.	What's happening here?  You're dead!	Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.	It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?	You are infected with <i>Chimera,</i> my friend.
You have Bellerophon.	Do I?	You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?	'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.	Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?	By asking me.	You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.	You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.	Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..	You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.	I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.	They'll kill me.
You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...	You're right, of course.
Come on!	His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.	Dimitri Miediev...Dimitri Miediev...
To friends.	Yes, Anatoly, yes.
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.	Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.	What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!	So what do you suggest?	Let's not waste time chasing him.  Make him come to us.  Everybodyís got pressure points.  Find out something that's important to him personally and you squeeze.
That's S.O.P..	S.O.P..
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!	Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!	Okay!
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.	What about him...?
Only four more cars.	And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.	Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?	High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.	But why tell us?	Heís putting on a show, Barnes.	What kind of show.	I donít know.  It didnít say on the tickets.
Nothing but civilians, Gene.	This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.	Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.	Good idea.
You knew about Jim?	Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like.	Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..	Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youíve asked the question and you are the answer.
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?	Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Satisfied?	All ten million.	Fold it.  Fold it tight.
Donít Jim.	Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?	Yes.
Is he serious?	Always.	If we're going to Virginia, why don't we drop by Fort Knox?  I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA.
Krieger can get it.  Right?	May take a little time.
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.	Krieger.	Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue
Did we get it?	We got it.  On your feet.	I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.	Walk, just walk.  Start walking.	I'm walking.	Talking's good, walking's better.	Sleeping's better.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?	If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.	Oh yeah?
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.	Roger that.
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?	Don't move.
You were in the car!	I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...	Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.	No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.	Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.	What happened to Jim?	There was nobody on the bridge.	What happened to Jim?
They're dead.  Jim's dead.	Take off your coat.	What?	Take off your God damn coat!
Where were you?	I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.	That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?	"Who is ""they?"""	Did they send you...Did they send you?	Who is they, who is they?
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?	No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
Why haven't they brought us in yet?	I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
What are you going to do?	I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.	Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...	Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
The message is for Job.	I'm going to answer it.
Max made a deal with you?	I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.	We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.	You're sure about this?	Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.	We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.	What kind of help?
May I come in?	Sure...
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.	You don't think we're going to make it.	I didn't say that.	You didn't have to.........	I just need you to be safe.	What about you?	What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.	We did what we had to do.	I'm going to try and get some sleep.
Kittridge...	Bastard!
What are you going to do?	He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
What happened?	I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for tomorrow.	Okay...	Is this the only way?	Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.	Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?	Two cars.  Where are you?	You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.	Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.	Ethan?
Claire...Hey...	This stuff is so sticky.	Claire.	Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...	I always have, Claire..
This is Kittridge.	Go secure.
Go ahead.	Theyíre dead.	Whoís dead?	My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- donít know	Are you damaged?	They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone.	<u>Are you intact</u>?	Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!	Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you followed?
I donít think so.	Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?	Yes.	Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.	Youíre in Prague?	Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.	No sir.	One hour.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.	Yeah.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?	Yeah.  I follow you.	We've lost enough agents for one night.	You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.	Who else is left?	Yes.  I see your point.	Why was there another team?	What?	Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.	I don't quite follow you.	Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?	You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.
"For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as ""Max."""	The arms dealer.	"That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as ""Job 314"".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight."	But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.	"Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  ""Golitsyn"" was a lightning rod, one of ours."	This whole operation was a molehunt.	Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said.  You survived.
Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...	How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.	Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.	Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
Kittridge.	I see you've been out visiting the folks.	It's Hunt.  What do you need for a pinpoint?  Been watching a little T.V., have you?
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?	Certainly Ethan.	If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?	I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
What are we downloading?	Information.	What kind?	Profitable.
This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.	There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.	You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.	You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.	Thinking Machine laptops, I'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- <u>with</u> the artificial intelligence Risk chip --
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.	Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.	I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.	Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.	Now I want you to hold onto it.	What makes you trust me?	Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.	I'm not letting this list get out in the open.	Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?	It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.	I'll get you close.
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?	About what?	The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.	Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list.	Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!	You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in.	Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.	You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?	I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.	It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?	Why don't you come back with me?	Just don't know why I'd be doing it.	You really liked Phelps, didn't you?	He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?	Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.	Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
Who are you and what are you doing here?	I need one hundred thousand dollars.	Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?	Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.	The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.	That depends.	On what?	Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.	It's quite out of the question.	The disk Job sold you is worthless.  It's bait, part of an internal molehunt.	And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?	Like Job?	Ah, but, we're asking about you.	I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.	Why, may I ask?	That's the question I want to ask Job.	I don't know Job any more than he knows me.	Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.	Why should I?	Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.	It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.	Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.	Mm - Hmmm...	Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?	Very good.	Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?	I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.	What was your deal with Job?	Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.	<u>Ten</u> million.  Ten million in negotiable U.S. Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  And one more thing -- your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.	Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.	How will you make sure Job will be there?	How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?	I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.	I wouldn't dream of it.
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.	It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.	The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.	What about Job?	I wouldnít worry about him.  Once youíve got the money -- heíll find you.
What sector's the air conditioning?	Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.	I gotta go in there and shut it down!	Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didn't go off.	Do you <u>want</u> to blow the fire through the whole building?
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.	Let's move!
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.	Bank?	IMF mainframe.	Where exactly is it?	In Langley.
Zero body count.	We'll see.	Time up.
Merci.	We're not outta here yet.
You're not going to any meeting without me.	My contact is extremely shy.
That's not it.  That's not the list.	What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Claire.	Jack.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!	Just waiting for you, tubs.
Sorry, am I interrupting?	Always.
Give me the God damn gum.	Just don't chew it.
Jack.  Jack.	I didn't touch it.
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.	Give me a break, Pops.
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.	Roger that.  Opening doors now.	Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to transport.
Higher.  Higher.	Higher.	Right, right.  Good.
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.	What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
The package is in the open.	Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.
Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.	Jim we canít.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.	Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.	No, weíre going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!
Would you remove your hat please?	Why?	You wish to meet Max?  This is the price of admission.
I thought I was going to see Max.	You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.	Then what am I doing here?	Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.	I don't communicate very well through a shroud.	If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.	I'm willing to take the chance.	Very well.
Forty-four.  Forty-five.	I'd say you've got about two minutes.
Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.	A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.	I thought I'd take some now.	What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.	Oh?  What's the problem?	I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.	Tell you what?	When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?	What problem?	Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?	I guess.	Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.	Why not?	Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
How was Chicago?	"Wonderful.  Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel.  You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years?  His wife's got a year old kid.  So he says ""All right.  Who was it?  My friend Harry?""  She says no. ""Oh, it was my friend Sammy.""  She says it wasn't Sammy.  ""Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou.""  ""No, what's the matter, don't you think I have any friends of my own?!"""
You're going to use Walter?	He's our guy.	Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?	Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.	He won't be back in a hurry?	No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?	Sure.  If the main character does.	If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.	We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
Iíve got a shadow.	Can you lose him?	No.  Abort.
Abort.  Thatís an order.	<u>Negative</u>, Golitsynís on the move.
Where are you?	About two hundred yards from the bridge.	Theyíre covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications.  Repeat. Cut all radio communications.
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.	- and picked us up in the States -	- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..	Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -	- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.	You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.	Hey, I showed 'em to you!	I remember..
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.	I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?	Yeah.	How did Kittridge do it?..
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!	We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.	Whatís going to make him do that?	What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.	Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.	A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.	Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.	If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
Jim...?	I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
- no.  She canít know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.	Youíre probably right.	I usually am.	Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.	You got it.	And get a doctor.	Good luck.
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.	They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn Gideons.
I knew about Jim.	"But, he didnít know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  ""Thou shall not covet thy Neighbourís wife"", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worldís lovers, heís tortured by the same, one pathetic question - ""does she feel the same way I do?"""
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?	Keep counting Claire.
Arenít you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.	Donít flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.	Youíre wrong about one thing.  Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive.
Jim, itís over.	Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?	Of course I can hear you.	No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?	Loud and clear.	What's going on?	I don't know.	Why don't you take a look?	Jack...that's spying.	That's what we do isn't it?	Jack you're so wicked.	Too wicked to have a drink later?	I think I might just take that look.
Such a nice ass.	And a lonely ass.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.	That's not so good for you, my friend.
Thirty-two and change.	Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?	Twenty minutes.
Yes...  Itís him.	This wasnít what we discussed.
Whatís the problem.	Connection denied.	Try it again.	Itís not working.	Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?	I always check the batteries.	Run it through from the top.
Itís working.	Phew!  Weíve got five minutes...
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.	No, I'm going.	The Shawfish?	Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.	Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.	I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
Are you ready?	Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?	Very good, Mr. Johnny.	We will both have the Salad Ticino.	Uh-huh	And I'll have the special fish.
No, I want to see the dessert cart.	Very good.
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.	I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
Who's dead?	Nobody. Loretta is getting married.	Again? Johnny Cammareri.
I don't like him.	You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
I have no money!	You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
I won't pay for nothing.	He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
I don't wanna talk about it.	Well, what do you wanna talk about!	Rita. Pass the wine.	Why you drinking so much?
Where you been?	I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
Cosmo?	What?	I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.	Thank you, Rose.	You're welcome.	I'm going to bed now.
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.	His brother.
Have I been a good wife?	Yes.	I want you to stop seeing her.
Okay.	And go to confession.	A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.	Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
I don't wanna talk about it.	Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?	I don't wanna talk about it.
Rose, pass the wine.	I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.	You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.	No. You were there.
Hi.  Hi.	Hello, Mr. Castorini.
I have my eyes open.	You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.	I don't know what you mean.	I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.	You haven't said anything.	And that's how much I'm saying.
Where's Ma?	Bed.	You're not sleepy?	I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.	Pop, I got news.
Here.  Ti amo.	Ti amo.	You look tired.	What's your news?	I'm getting married.	Again?	Yeah.	You did this once it didn't work out.	The guy died.	What killed him?	He got hit by a bus.	No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?	Johnny Cammareri.	Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?	He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.	More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?	In a month.	I won't come.	You've got to come. You've got to give me away.	I didn't give you away the first time.	And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.	Maybe.	I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.	He did?	Yeah.	That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
Here.	It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.	It's temporary.	Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.	So you'll come to the wedding, right?	Let's go tell your Mother.
Mona?	What'd you do to your hair?	I got it done.	What are you doing here?	What are you doing here?	Who is this man? You're engaged!	You're married.	You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!	You're my father.	Alright. I didn't see you here.	I don't know whether I saw you or not.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.	And what did they say?	The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.	You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.	I brought you something.
Oh, Cosmo!	They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
You haven't once said you like my dress.	I like your dress.  It's very bright.
Why you looking around so much?	I don't know. I got a feeling.	I'm wearing your bracelet.
It's wrong to just let them go.	Good morning, Lucy.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.	You have too many dogs.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.	You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.	Hurry up.
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.	I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
Yes!	Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
Yeah, this is Ronny.	I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
Why didn't he call himself?	He's in Palermo.	What's wrong can never be made right.	Let me come and talk to you.
Have you come from my brother?	Yes.	Why?	I'm going to marry him.	You are going to marry my brother?	Yes. Do you want...	I have no life.	Excuse me.	I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.	I don't understand.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!	Maybe I should come back another time.	No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.	That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?	That's it.	But that wasn't Johnny's fault.	I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget?
Loretta. What's that smell?	I'm making you a steak.	You don't have to help me.	I know that. I do what I want.	I like it well done.	You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
This is good. Uhh...	Loretta.	Where'd Johnny find you?	He knew my husband who died.	How'd he die?	Bus hit him.	Fast.	Instantaneous.	When you get engaged?	Yesterday.
Why?	Why what?	I don't know.	So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?	No.	Stupid.	When your husband get hit by the bus?	Seven years ago.	How many men since then?	Just Johnny.	Stupid yourself.	No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.	I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.	What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?	Why you talking to me?	You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
She was right to leave me.	You think so?	Yes.	You really are stupid, you know that.
You don't know nothing about it.	I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!	I'm a wolf?	The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!	What are you doing!	I'm telling you your life!	Stop it!	No!	Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!	Because I have no Luck!	He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!	I am looking where I should to become a bride!	A bride without a head!	A wolf without a foot!
Son of a bitch!	Where are you taking me?	To the bed.	Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
I can't believe what is happening.	Me neither.	I was dead.	I was dead, too.
Your blood.	All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.	Loretta.	I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.	I've got you.	Get all of me. Take everything.	What about Johnny?	You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!	Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
What?	That light.	I don't know. I think it's the moon.
It's so bright.	I've never seen a moon like that.	It makes you look like an angel.
Oh my God.	What?
What? What have we done?	Take it easy.	This time I was trying to do everything right.	Don't just become excited.	I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.	You're trying to make me feel guilty.	I'm marrying your brother!	All right, I'm guilty. I confess!	You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?	She didn't like me.	You don't get along with anybody!	What did you do?	What did I do?	You ruined my life.	That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!	Oh no I didn't!
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!	What?	Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!	I can't do that!	Why not?	I'm in love with you!
Snap out of it!	I can't!	Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.	I'll come to the wedding.	I'm telling you you can't.	But he wants me to come!	But that's cause he don't know!	Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.	What?	That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.	What are you talking about?	I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.	Alright.	Alright. Meet me at the Met.	Alright. Where's the Met?
Hi.	Hi.	You look beautiful. Your hair...	I thought I'd try it.  You look good.	Thank you.
Who painted that?	Marc Chagall. A Russian.	Kinda gaudy.	He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
Thank you!	For what?	I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
So. Where are we sitting?	Come on.
They get some turnout for this stuff.	It's the best thing there is.	I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
That was just so... awful!	Awful?	Beautiful. Sad. She died!	Yeah.	I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
No thanks.	I think that's it.
What do you want to do now?	I wanna go home.
It's really cold.	Yeah. It smells like snow.
What's the matter?	How can you ask me that?	You're making me feel guilty again.	You are guilty. I'm guilty.	Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.	I know what I know.	And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?	He didn't come!	I'm here!	You're late!	We're here.
This is your place.	That's right.	This is where we're going!	Yeah.	The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?	Yeah.	I'm really afraid.	Why?	I'm afraid of who I am.	I was.	And you're not now?
Why not?	I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.	Let me go home.	No.	Let me go home.	No.	I'm freezing to death.	Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Ronny!	Is Johnny here?	He's coming.	Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother.
You've gotta get outta here.	No. I'm gonna wait.	Ronny, please...
No, I'll tell him.	No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.	Loretta, what are you talking about?	I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
Loretta?	What!	Will you marry me.
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?	Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
I got things to do.	Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.	Right.
What's the matter? You look crazy.	I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
Bye, Aunt Rita.	Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?	Yeah, I'll be in.
Hi Loretta.	Hi.
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?	You? No.
It's Johnny Cammareri.	Johnny.
You don't want the fish.	No?	It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.	Maybe you're right.	Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.	She was too young for him.
You never have dessert.	Never is a long time.
What's the matter?	My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
Have Something.	I shouldn't.	Will you marry me?	What?	Will you marry me?	Bobo, take the cart away.
Are you proposing marriage to me?	Yes?	You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.	What do you mean?	We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.	I don't understand.	Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?	On the floor?	Yes, on the floor.	This is a good suit.	I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.	Alright.
I like this ring.	You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
What time is it?	Seven-thirty.	So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
What about the wedding?	My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.	How near is she to death?	A week. Two weeks. No more.	Then let's set the date.	How about a month from today?	Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?	Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.	Alright. A month. In a month.	A month from today?	Yeah.	I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.	You've made me very happy, Johnny.
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.	Who is he?	He's my younger brother.	You have a brother?	We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?	Sure.
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.	How was your plane ride?	The waitresses were very nice.  My mother is slipping away.
Have you told her we're getting married?	Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.	We should talk alone.	I can't. I need my family around me now.	Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
Johnny, I have something to tell you.	I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.	I have no secrets from my family.	Loretta, I can't marry you.	WHAT?	If I marry you my mother will die.
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!	I must ask for that back.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.	In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
What?	Where's the ring?
No.	Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?	Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.	And who's gonna pay for that?	Pop.
Will you live here?	No.	Why not?	Pop don't like Johnny.
So we'll sell the house.	I got married before, you didn't sell.
Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...	I'm thirty-seven years old.	What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.	Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.	And we'll sell the house.	I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.	No. He don't.
How's the mother?	She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.	Did he tell her?	Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
Hi.	Where you been?	I don't wanna talk about it.	Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.	Thanks. What's the matter with you?	Cosmo's cheating on me.	What! How do you know?	A wife knows.	Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
What the hell happened to you?	Well. I don't really know where to start.	Your hair's different.	Everything's different.	Are you drunk?	No. Are you drunk?	No. But I have a hangover.	Where's pop?	Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
What? He's in Sicily!	No more he's not.	He's with his dying mother!	She recovered.	WHAT!! She was dying!	It was a miracle.	A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!	I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
Do you love him, Loretta?	Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.	Oh God, that's too bad.
Hi.	Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...	What's the matter with him?
What about the moon?	Did you see it?	No.	Oh.	Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.	You gotta date?
Hi, Loretta.	Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
We just come from the bank.	The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.	What sins have you to confess?	Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.	Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?	I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.	That's a pretty big sin.	I know.	You should think about this.	I know.	Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.	Alright.	I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.	I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.	My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.
Don't fight.	My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.	He should pay.	I don't know.	He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.	Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
Don't fight.	If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
Don't make yourself sick.	Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.	Talk to him.	I will. But I must find the right moment.	Did you see the moon last night?
Moving in?	I came right from the airport.	Come on in.
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.	She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
So.	Where is she?	Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.	It's late.	Yes.
Maybe I should go?	What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.	That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.	A miracle. Well, that's news.	My mother's recovered.	You're kidding?	The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!	That's incredible.	Yes.
Who was that?	That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?	Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.	But why would a man need more than one woman?	I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
That's it! That's the reason!	I don't know.	No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.	You don't know where Loretta is?	No idea.	Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.	Okay, I'll tell her.
Loretta...	Johnny...	Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!	Good.	Have you come to make peace with me?	Well. Yeah. You may not want to.	Of course I want to.
I'm sure she did.	It was a miracle!
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.	You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.	And you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
Yes?	Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?	But absolutely!
Can I get another one of these?	Definitely!
May I presume to ask you a question?	Sure!	Do you have a girlfriend?	I am alone in the world.
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.	What happened?	She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?	Absolutely!
Thanks, comrade.	It's nothing!
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.	I'm not disturbed. By you.	My lady friend has a personality disorder.	She was just too young for you.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?	None of your business.
Sorry. That was rude.	Will you join me for dinner?	Are you sure?
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.	What do you do?	I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.	That woman was a student of yours?	Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.	There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?	Yes.	Don't shit where you eat.	I'll remember that. What do you do?	I'm a housewife.	Then why are you eating alone?	I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?	Go ahead.	Why do men chase women?	Nerves.	I think it's because they fear death.	Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.	I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.	What you don't know about women is a lot.
May I walk with you a ways?	Sure.
You knew that man?	Yes.
Temperature's dropping.	Yes.	I guess you can't invite me in?	No.	People home.	No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.	I'm a little cold.	You're a little boy and you like to be bad.	We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.	I'm too old for you.	I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.	Good night.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?	Sure.
I'm freezing	Good night.
That's my house.	You mean the whole house?	Yes.	My God, it's a mansion!	It's a house.	I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?	He's a plumber.	Well. That explains it.
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.	Marriage is happy news.
Rita. Rita.	What? What?	Look.	Oh.	It's Cosmo's moon.	What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.	I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.	Is who down there?	Cosmo.	What would he be doing down there?	I don't know.	You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!	You were a tiger last night.	And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.	Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.	So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.	Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?	I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
You got me.	You see that moon last night?
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.	Oh. Right.
She's got it.	I knew she had it.
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.	WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
How do you know she is a witch?	She looks like one. Yes, she does.	Bring her forward.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!	Did you dress her up like this?
Burn her anyway.	Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?	Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?	Burn them.	And what do you burn, apart from witches?
I see.  Yes, of course.	So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
Ah.  Yes, of course ... um ... err ...	Does wood sink in water?	No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.	Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?	Bread?  No, no, no.  Apples .... gravy ... very small rocks ...
Halt!  Who goes there?	It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
Get away!	I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.	What?  Ridden on a horse?	Yes!	You're using coconuts!	...What?	You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.	So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.	Where did you get the coconuts?	Through ... We found them.	Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!	What do you mean?	Well, this is a temperate zone.	The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.	Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?	Not at all.  They could be carried.	What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.	Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?	Please!	Am I right?	I'm not interested.
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...	He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.	And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.	But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?	Seek you the Bridge of Death ...	The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?	How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?	King of the WHO?	The Britons.	Who are the Britons?	All of us are ... we are all Britons.
Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in that castle?	No one live there.	Well, who is your lord?	We don't have a lord.	What?
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?	I am your king!	Well, I didn't vote for you.	You don't vote for kings.	Well, how did you become king, then?	The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
The same!	Who are they?	We are the keepers of the sacred words.  NI ... Peng ... and Neee ... Wom!
"Knights Who Say ""Ni"" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ..."	NI!	Oh!	NI!   NI!	Oh!	We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.	All right!  What do you want?	We want ... a shrubbery!	A what?	Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...	You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!	Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.	One that looks nice.	Of course.	And not too expensive.	Yes ...	Now - go!
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?	That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.	What is that?	We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!	Oh, please!	Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done!
What word?	I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!	How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?	You said it again!	"What, ""is""?"	"No, no ... not ""is""!"
None shall pass.	What?	None shall pass.	I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.	Then you shall die.	I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.	I move for no man.	So be it!
Now stand aside worthy adversary.	'Tis but a scratch.	A scratch?  Your arm's off.	No, it isn't.	Well, what's that then?	I've had worse.	You're a liar.	Come on you pansy!
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...	Come on then.	What?
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.	Had enough?	You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.	Course I have.	Look!	What!  Just a flesh wound.	Stop that.	Had enough ... ?	I'll have your leg.
I'll do you for that.	You'll what ... ?	Come Here.	What are you going to do. bleed on me?	I'm invincible!	You're a looney.	The Black Knight always triumphs. Have at you!
All right, we'll call it a draw.	Come, Patsy.
Hello.	'Allo.  Whoo is eet?	I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?	This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.	Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.	Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?	What?
Are you sure he's got one?	Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +	Well ... can we come up and have a look?	Of course not!  You are English pigs.	Well, what are you then?	I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?	I am Arthur, King of the Britons.	My liege ... forgive me ...
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?	My liege,  I am honored.
What is your name?	Bedevere, my Liege.	Then I dub you ... Sir Bedevere ... Knight of the Round Table!
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.	This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.	OF course, my Liege ...
Now what happens?	Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!	Who ... Who breaks out?	Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
"Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say ""Ni""!"	"No!  Not the Knights Who Say ""Ni""!"
Nu!	"No.  Ni!  More like this. ""Ni""!"	Ni, ni, ni!	|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!	Ni!	That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
Ni!	No.  No.  No!
They're nervous, sire.	Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
What with?	Just keep me covered.
There!  Look!	What does it say?
What?	It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
What?	It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.  ARTHUR turns. | |                              ARTHUR |      Who was that? | |                              HECTOR |           |      It was Sir Alf. | |                              ARTHUR |      I didn't know we had a Sir Alf. | |                              HECTOR |      He was feeding it bread. | |                              ARTHUR |           |      Well, that was a very silly thing to do.  Now the rest of you stand |      well back from the BLACK BEAST of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              HECTOR |      Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |                              ROBIN |      Look out. | |  The animation MONSTER starts lumbering towards them.

We shall attack at once.	Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
Who are they?	Oh, just some friends!
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?	I am an enchanter.
By what name are you known?	There are some who call me Tim?	Greetings Tim the Enchanter!	Greetings King Arthur.	You know my name?	I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.	That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.	Quite.
What?	A G...g...g...	A Grail?
Look, you're a busy man ...	Yes, I can help you with your guest.
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.	How shall we find this cave, O Tim?	Follow!
Too late.	What?	There he is!
Where?	There.	Behind the rabbit?	It is the rabbit.	... You silly sod.	What?	You got us all worked up.
Je...sus Christ!	I warned you!
Oh, shut up.	It's always the same ... if I've said it once.	Charge!
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.	Who did we lose?
Old woman!	Man!	Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?	I'm thirty-seven.	What?
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.	":Well - I can't just say:  ""Hey, Man!'"
"Well you could say: ""Dennis"""	I didn't know you were called Dennis.	You didn't bother to find out, did you?	I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...	What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...	Well ... I AM king.	Oh, very nice. King, eh!  I expect you've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food.  And how d'you get that? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society!  If there's EVER going to be any progress ...
I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.	Yes.	... But all the decision of that officer ...	Yes, I see.	... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.	Be quiet!	... but a two-thirds majority ...	Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!	Shut up!	I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!	Shut up, will you. Shut up!	Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.	Shut up!
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!	Bloody peasant!	Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.	Come on, patsy.
Sorry ...	And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?	I'm averting my eyes, Lord.	Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of	Yes, Lord.	Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...	Good idea, O Lord!	Course it's a good idea.
Well?	... Well, we did do the nose.	The nose?	And the hat.  But she is a witch.
... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.	Why do you think she is a witch?
Make a bridge out of her.	Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
Exactly.  So... logically ...	If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.	And therefore?
Nothing... There's your ninepence.	I'm not dead!
He will be soon. He's very ill.	I'm getting better!	You're not.   You'll be stone dead in a few minutes.
I feel fine.	Do me a favour.
I think I'll go for a walk.	You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?	I feel happy... I feel happy.
Who approaches the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see.	Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.	What is your name?	My name is Sir Launcelot.	What is your quest?	To find the Holy Grail.	What is your favorite colour?	Blue.	Right.  Off you go.
That's easy!	Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!	Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.	What is your name?	My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!	What is your quest?	To seek the Grail!	What is the capital of Assyria?	I don't know that!
Bring out your dead!	Here's one!	Ninepence.
'Ere.  He says he's not dead.	Yes he is.
Don't be such a baby.	I can't take him.
I can't.	Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.	I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.	When's your next round?	Thursday.
Thanks very much.	That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
Who's that then?	I dunno, Must be a king.	Why?	He hasn't got shit all over him.
Well taken, Concorde!	Thank you, sir, most kind ...	And another!
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!	I'm not quite dead, sir ...	Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!	I think I could pull through, sir.	Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.	I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.	Really, I feel fine, sir.	Farewell, Concorde!	It just seems silly ... me lying here.
Did you kill all those guards?	Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...	They cost fifty pounds each!	Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
You killed eight wedding guests in all!	Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.	I can understand that.
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...	Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!	Gosh - Is he all right?	You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!	I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.	Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....	Is it?
Do you want to come and have a drink?	Oh ... that's awfully nice.
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...	Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...	What - the curtains?	No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.	But, Mother ...	Father, lad.	But, Father, I don't really want any of that.	Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.	But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...	Rather what?	I'd rather ... just ... sing ...	You're not going to do a song while I'm here!
I don't want land.	Listen, Alice ...	Herbert.	Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.	But I don't like her.	Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...	I know ... but ... I want the girl that I marry to  have ... a certain ... special ... something ...
But, Father.	Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
Who are you?	I'm ... your son ...	Not you.
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!	Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!	I was saved at the last minute.	How?	Well ... I'll tell you ...
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.	Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.	No.  Until I come and get him.
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.	... and you'll come and get him.
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.	Leaving the room.	Leaving the room ... yes.	Got it?
Er ... if ... we ... er ...	Yes?	If we ... er ...	Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?	No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...	Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.	No ... just keep him in here.	Until you, or anyone else ...	No, not anyone else - just me.	Just you ...
Right.	Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.	And make sure he doesn't leave.	What?	Make sure he doesn't leave.	The Prince ... ?	Yes ...  make sure ...	Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...	Is that clear?
Where are you going?	We're coming with you.	No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.	Oh, I see,  Right.
The Castle Anthrax?	Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!	Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?	The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
Well, look er, I ...	What is your name, handsome knight?	Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.	Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...	Sir Galahad!!
Well ...	I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!	No, It's nothing!	You must see the doctors immediately.  You must lie down.
Camelot ...	Camelot ...
Sir Galahad!	Oh ... hello ...	Quick!	Why?	You are in great peril.
Well, she's got a point.	We'll cover your escape!	Look - I'm fine!
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!	No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.	I don't think I was.	You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.	Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?	It's too perilous.
Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.	No, no, we must find the Grail.
Oh, let me go and have a bit of peril?	No.  It's unhealthy.	... I Bet you're gay.	No, I'm not.
Sir Gawain.	Ector.
Well,  what seems to be the trouble?	They're doctors?
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...	We must examine you.	There's nothing wrong with ... that.	Please ... we are doctors.
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!	Back to your bed!  At once!	I'm sorry, I must go.
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...	You got my note!	Well ... yes ...	You've come to rescue me?	Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...	I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.	He's come to rescue me, father.	Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
Hurry!	I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.	A path!  A little path for the late Knights of Ni!
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.	Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
Oh!	Don't say that word.
Stop saying the word!	Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
They're all saying the word ...	Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...	You've said it!  Aaaaarghhh! ... We've said it ... Wwe're all saying it.
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!	That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!

I done it again.	Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.	Brave, Sir Rob ...	Shut up.
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...	Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
Brave Sir Robin ran away.	I didn't.	Bravely ran away, away.	No, no, no.	When danger reared its ugly head, He bravely turned his tail and fled Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about And gallantly he chickened out Bravely taking to his feet He beat a very brave retreat Bravest of the brave Sir Robin Petrified of being dead Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin Turned away and fled.
So?	So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.	I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.	You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.	I speak as I find, Archie.	Not down south you don't.
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?	I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
How much?	Seventy a year.	Not bad, not bad.	How about yourself?	Sixty.	That's pretty good for a ghillie.
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?	It's better than shovelling horse shit.

Is that not a bit long to be grieving?	She loved him.	Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...	What?	You know what I mean.	I'm not sure I do, Archie.	There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
Which one of us is she flirting with?	The good-looking one.	Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.	You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.	So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.	Aye, but will they?	John, it's not your problem what she eats.	The woman's surrounded by fools!  She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
She's got an army of people to get her up and out.	But I'm the only one she trusts.
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.	I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
And she sent no word down?	They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?	She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
What are you doing?!	I'm getting dressed.	You've got three broken ribs, man!	I've got my duties to attend to.	Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.	She'll be worried about me.	She'll get over it.	I can't let her down now, Archie.	And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.	Oh, I'm much more than that.	Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.	You watch your tongue.	Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.	You know nothing about her!	When are you gonna see it, John?  She doesn't give a damn about you.
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!	Aye.	She means it.
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.	Get out.  Out!
What's this?	It's a diary.	Be careful who sees it.	What do you take me for?
You should have someone look after you.	I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
The place is a mess.	I can't move to tidy.	It's what the maids are for.	I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her.	She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face.  How can I stop now?
What's your name?	Mary Taylor, sir.	Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?	I hope to go up next year.	You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
Checked and locked, sir.	Louder, girl!	Checked and locked, sir.	Kitchen and lower house.
Hey, Barney.	Mr Brown, sir --	It's cold out there tonight, Barney.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.	Yeah, yeah, I did.	Good man.  And is she all right?	Yeah.	Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?	Yeah.	Are you all right, Barney?
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.	Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.	Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?	I don't think I've had that pleasure.
No doubt you've heard the rumors.	I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.	My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.	Of course.	I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.	I see.	I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.	A situation?	I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.	I'm flattered you think so.	I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.	Quite.
It's the Queen's decision.	I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
I wish to see my mother.	She's busy.	Convey her a message.	She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.	Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.	Are you deaf as well as stupid?
What did you say?	I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?	Do you know who you address, sir?	Whom you address.	The future King!
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.	Out of my way!
Gesture?	I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?	No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?	It's so infernally cold in here.	Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
Mother....	... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--	I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...	It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.	Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?	It is quite late enough.	But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --	Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.	Mama...	And that is my last word on the matter.	Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant.
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.	Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.	By whose authority?	My own.
The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.	That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!	We --	You'll talk when I'm finished!
Checked and locked, sir.	Back and upper corridors.
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.	How will I know?	I'm sorry?	How will I know what she requires?	You'll be sent a message.	Who'll bring it to me?	Her Highness' Equerry.	I need a man who knows where I am.	I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.	That's not good enough.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.	Aye, do.
There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.	I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.	In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
Do you?	Yes.  I do.
Awaiting my orders.	You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.	I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.	You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.	No.	I beg your pardon?
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.	Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
Go inside at once.	Is that the Queen's request?	Yes, it most certainly is!
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.	She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.	That can wait till the weekend.	There are important papers from --	It can wait.  Anything else?
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.	I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.	Don't think I can't persuade her.	I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.	This is a slur on her good name.	In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.	Nobody has any rights over me.	We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.	I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
What brings you here?	A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
What do you know about the Highlands?	I am a blank sheet.	Do you hunt?	Occasionally.	Dare say you can be taught.	To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.	If you hunt, you kill.
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.	Quite.
You sent for me.	I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.	I don't think about it.
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.	I'm fine.	You're injured.	It's nothing.	Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.	I'm not married.	Oh.	This is the top.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.	I wouldn't know.	Surely --	What I do, I do for my Queen.	Was there never ambition?	Maybe, once.	Then I envy yo.	Why?	To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.	I do what I do.	For Her Majesty.	Aye.	But yourself?  What about John Brown?	I said.  I serve the Queen.	No other aspiration?
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.	Why do you think I keep her here?	Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents.  The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that?  However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.
So...?	The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.	Her mind is set.  She won't change now.	She trusts you, John.
They don't see it.	See what?	The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.	They aren't as watchful as you.	Too busy looking after themselves.	The greasy pole.	No loyalty.	No love.
I promised to protect her from people like you.	For once in my life, I am not the issue.	She'll never understand it.	In time, she will.	She'll think I betrayed her.	But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
Mr Brown.	Ma'am.	You are here safely.	Aye, ma'am.	You are well?	I am.	And the pony?	She's well, too.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.	I'm glad of it.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.	I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.	Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.	Archie.	Yes.  That will be company for you.	Yes, ma'am.
Mr Brown.	Yes, ma'am.	You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.	Yes, ma'am.	Then why do you persist in doing it?	Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.	And I intend to be there when she's ready.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.	It's a fine spot, ma'am.	He thought so, yes.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.	Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?	Aye, ma'am.	Yes.
What are those?	What?	Those, over there, there.	Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.	Craobhan-geanmchno...  How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
"I am thinking of publishing my ""Highland Journals."""	Are they worth reading?	I am told so.	Who by?	Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.	What does he know about the Highlands?	He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.	That doesn't make him an expert.	His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.	I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.	I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.	Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.	Of course I shall say what I have to say.  I always do.
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.	What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
They're ready now.	I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.	Ah, well...
We took a nip of whiskey.	To keep out the cold.	Aye.
What is it, John?  John?	I heard something.
Must they always follow us?	I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.	Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?	Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.	The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.	I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
John?	Yes, ma'am?	I was told you were in a fight.	Yes, ma'am.	Has someone seen to those bruises?	Yes, ma'am.
Ma'am?	Yes?	Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.	I do not accept.
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --	The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
Duty?!  You talk about duty?!	If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.	I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --	Have I ever let you down before--?	-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!	I'm breaking no promises!	You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!	For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!	I will not hear any more about my safety!!  You made me a promise and now you have broken it!
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!	Then why send me back to them?!	Because I have to!
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.	Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.	Yes.  Yes it was.
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.	Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.	I came as quickly as I could.	You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?	I beg your pardon?
What can we do?	Oh, several things.
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.	But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
Then they may read about me.	Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.	Is that not enough?	In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.	Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?	No, ma'am.
This is my good John Brown.	Yes.	I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
Should we take it seriously?	The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?	Well, both.	The question is, do we need her?	Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--	My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.	So?	We'll see which way the wind blows.
I see the Prince of Wales is here.	I hope he got his mother's permission.
What did he want?	To know when he'll be king.
We're going to lose.	You can't know that for sure.	Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?	Who?	Mrs Brown.	It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.	In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.	She's refusing to leave Balmoral.	What's her excuse this time?	The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.	"I was trying to imagine ""rather upset."""
A fine choice, sir.	Excellent!
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.	No, she wasn't.
Erysipelas.	Not too protracted, I hope.	A few days...  When he heard, the Prince of Wales threw the bust from the window of the Royal Gallery.  It took four hours to gather the fragments.
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.	Dear oh dear.	We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?	Yes.	Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.	Of course.
Where did you find it by the way?	Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.	No, indeed.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.	Whom?
I'm sorry, ma'am?	Cold is good!	Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...	Why am I being lectured in this way?!	Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--	I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.	The same, your Majesty.
Why was I not informed?	I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.	How ill is he?
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.	Just them?	Yes, ma'am.
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.	What is he doing there?	He appears to be ... standing by his horse.	I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?	I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe.
Well?	Mr Brown is unable to attend today.	Why?	I believe he is unwell, ma'am.	Unwell?	I understand he was in a fight.	Has he been hurt?	I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
How long has he been this sick?	A few days, ma'am.	Why was I not told earlier?
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.	I'm very sorry, ma'am.  I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.	Please make sure it does not happen again.	Of course, at once.
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.	Why?	He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.	No.  I shall be out walking.
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.	We were expecting you to return by six.	And now I am back.
Read it.	Again?	Read it!
Who told them that?	I have no idea.	Why not?	I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!	Your Majesty --	Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?!  I am not a fool.  I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert.  And now they attack Brown too.
There is one other matter.	What is it?	I have a letter, ma'am.	From whom?	From Princess Helena and other members of your family.	My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
What do they want?	They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Ma'am?	Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?	Ma'am.
That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.	Yes, ma'am.
Where is my son?	Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.	Why is he not here?	He is sick, ma'am.	Then why are you not with him?	You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.	What is the matter with him?	He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
Does that thing work?	Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
What do you mean?	It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes.	How do you stop The Screamer?	You can't.  He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get progressively less time to complete.  First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.  If you don't...
What's the riddle?	If I tell you, then it's no fun.	Just tell me the fucking riddle.	Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
How the hell did you do that?	Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
Could you play ARCADE with that?	"Well, technically ""yes"", but this is only the prototype."
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?	Sure.
We're having some problems with ARCADE...	Yeah, who isn't.
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...	Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.	What's the question mark?	Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.	How do you do that?	Good question.  See, that's where the fun comes in.  ARCADE changes it every time. He's a machine without a soul. Once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat.
But how can it change every time?	It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
Dead?	Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important.	Maybe he's not dead.	He?	The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.	And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
Nick, Alex, how are we today?	How'd you know it was us?	Security camera.  Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live.
Now what seems to be the problem?	It's the game, ARCADE.	You don't like it?
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.	Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.	Why don't we take this into my office.
Talk to me.	There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
"He thinks I'm ""sublimating""."	What the hell does that mean?
Has anyone seen Greg?	He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
Sick?	Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.	What's her problem?	Did you play ARCADE last night?	Actually, no.  I was just telling Nick, here, that my t.v.'s busted...
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?	I came from the city on the left.	But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth.
So where is he?	Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?	Yeah...	So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...	But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Hello?	Hey, kid.
Nick...	Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...	Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.	What the hell are you talking about?
I have to talk to you.	We are talking...	No, in person.  Now.	It's twelve-thirty!	I'm coming over.
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.	Funny.
"What do you mean by ""weird""?"	Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
Can you turn off the game?	I'm in the middle of it...	Turn if off!
Happy?	No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
"No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, ""In here""."	Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...	It is.	How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.	So how did it know my name, then?	You imagined it.
"See, men always do this.  ""Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium"". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!"	Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
It turned itself back on, Nick.	No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.	Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
Something's happened to them.	It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.	All of them?
Because I didn't know where else to go.	It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?	Sure.
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...	No way.	If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.	Okay.  We'll see what's up.  But if things are cool, I don't want to hear anything more about this.  Life's too short, know what I mean?
Well?	She thought Benz was at school.
Where to now?	Laurie's.
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?	It doesn't necessarily mean she's...	Let's go around back.
Change the channel!	What?!
Then leave her.	We can't...	We'll call 911.  Look around Alex.  We broke in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to believe what happened here!
Where do we go?	My house.  I want to try something.
That's what I thought.	What?	It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.	Nick, what is it.	Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.	Like the fractals?
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...	...but then it hits the relay stations...	Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.	It's already out.	The Police, then...	Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...	Then where do we go?!	I don't know.
SLIP-STREAM.	What?	They made ARCADE.  It's still a game, right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
You mean we learn the rules...	And beat it at it's own game.	You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.	I was afraid you'd say that.
Virgin sacrifices?	Drives 'em crazy every time.
"What Alex is trying to say is that it ""seems"" like it's alive."	No I'm not...	We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff...  I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right?
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?	What are you going to do?	Get that helmet.  If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible.
Jesus Christ!	I can't believe you made it!
You got the schematics?	Everything.
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?	Dante's Inferno.	Yeah.  The Inferno.
Alex...	You didn't hear me?
What are you looking for?	A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...	Put in a quarter.	It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.	Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
You're not coming, Alex.	Yes I am...	I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.	And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!	No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.
You don't get it, do you?	What?	I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.	I already have a boyfriend, Nick.	I know.  It sucks.
You feel it?  It's different this time.	We're actually inside, aren't we?
Okay.  Give us a kiss?	One.  In case...	Don't even say it.
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.	Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.	That's what I was hoping you'd say.
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.	Got it.
Which way do you think Level Two is?	You've got the schematics, check.
Okay.  It's West.	The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
The clock's already ticking.	Right, then...
And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake.	Yeah, that's what worries me.
Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies.	There...
Shit...	Check your read-out.
Our time's up.	What?!  There's nothing here!	Look around...
What the fuck is that?!	Screamer.
We can't reach that!	We don't have a choice!
So that's what we almost died for?	One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?	I don't want to talk about it.
Christ...no time...	There never is.
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.	Never been on a snowboard.
What is it?	I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.	I know.	So tell me you're okay, then.	I'm okay.	Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.	And then keep on driving?	Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever.
Go for it.	Hold my keys, then.
So how did you do it, Alex?	Well, it's a long story...
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!	Yes...	Thought so.
Then we'll go home?	Then we'll go home.
Which way?	That way.
It's the wrong way!	In this world, wrong is right!
It's here!!!	Oh God...oh god...
What did he do to you?	Is that your question?	Wait!  No!  That's not it!
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!	You have no time.  What is your question?	I'm thinking!	You have no time.
Mom?  You're alive...	Of course I am.	But I don't understand...	I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?	Yes...but...how did you...
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?	Not yet, honey...
We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us.	So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months.
A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.	That's impossible.	Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?
"""Escape""?"	In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?	It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.	So how do I start?	The game will guide you.
So what do you think?	Sign me up.
This is one of our newest projects. We're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...	The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
It means she's screwed up.	Fucked up.  That's what they said I was.
Cool.	"Can you say anything but ""cool""?"	Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things...
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.	I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?	I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
So start at the beginning...	Give her a chance, will you?	I am giving her a chance.  Why don't you get off my back?
Adam, where are you?	What's going on, Cynthia?	They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.	What did you say?	They fired everyone.	Who fired everyone?
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!	No.	You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.	I'm going home.	Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!	I'm going home Cynthia.	Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.	I'm going home. I'll call you later.
Someone's shut off my money!	I know.  Where are you Adam?	"What do you mean ""you know""?"	Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.	And?	You're broke!	But I'm not broke.	I know, but you're broke. Where are you?	Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?	The Cowboy??	Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.	Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?	Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.	Cynthia...what's going on?	It's been a very strange day.	And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?	Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.	You gotta be kidding?	Will you meet with him?	Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?	I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
Cynthia... that would not be a good idea.	I'm just offering a place to stay.	I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.	Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.	Git along little dowgie and call me back.
So what's the problem?	There is no problem.	So why did you idiots bring me here? ... I'm in the middle of making a picture.
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.	Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!	I'll speak to someone.	And you'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client!! This smells like a set-up to me!  And by the way, Ray, I don't know who these guys are kidding, but every foot of film I've shot is in a vault at the lab that only I can access. No one's getting that film!!
Howdy!	Howdy to you.
Beautiful night.	Yeah.	Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.	No problem. What's on your mind?	Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?	Whatever.	A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?	Sure.	Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?	I agree with what you said...truly.	What did I say?	That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.	So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.	How's that?
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?	Okay, I'm thinking.	No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?	Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?	There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?	One.	So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.	Okay.	Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...
It will work out.	Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?	I understand.	You're an understandin' fella.	So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?	No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.	Okay.
Yes...what is it?	I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.	... What??	The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.	How...  how'd they know I was here?	I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.	So, what did they say?	Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.	Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?	That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.	Fine. I'll check out in the morning.	Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.	Yes, he is. He raises corn.	Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.	Well, I ...	"You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called ""tits and ass."""
I...	You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.	Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.	Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
I guess I've come to quite a place.	Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
No, I don't.	That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.	I can hardly wait, Coco.
It's unbelievable!	I told ya.	Wow!	Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.	Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.	You got it! See you later honey.
Your Aunt called me.	I was afraid of that.	She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.	It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...	Sweetie, look at me straight.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.	So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.	Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
You're really something Coco...thank you.	Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.	It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?	No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.	His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.	Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing	Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.	Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
Get going. You don't want to be late.	Right. See ya.	Good luck, honey!
That's okay.	I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
There was an accident. I came here.	I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
A car ... a car accident.	Are you okay?	I think so. I was just taking a shower.	Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
My name is Rita.	Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Betty Elms?	Yes.	I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.	Very pleased to meet you.	Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
Hi.	Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
No, no, I'm fine.	Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.	What?	I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?
Betty.	Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
You're still here?	I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
I can call them... I can call my dad.	But you won't.
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...	Before what?
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.	Yes, there was.	Can you tell me what happened?	No. I can't.	Was anyone hurt?	May I have your name please?
Yes?	Diane?	Number 17.	But it said #12.	I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.
Well ... we'll leave her a note.	I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
No ..........I.	I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.	She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.	She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.	I think I've been hurt.	Oh...
No.	But, this could be serious.	No...I need to sleep.	If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.	It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.	All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
What is it Rita?	I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
What's wrong?	I don't know who I am.	What do you mean? You're Rita.	I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?	What do you mean?	Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?	Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.	How do you remember how to talk?
I don't know.	You don't remember anything else?	No  There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it.  There are things there.... but I'm... here.
The money. You don't know where it came from?	Unh, unh.	When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
Mulholland Drive.	Mulholland Drive?	That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.	Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.	No.... I don't...	We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
Okay... but just...just to see.	Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.	Okay.	Come on... let's find you something to wear.
There's nothing?	Not that I can see.
No. Just the coffee.	We'll take our check.
Strange to be calling yourself.	Maybe it's not me.	Call the number.
It's not my voice ... but I know her.	Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.	Maybe...maybe ... maybe.
What's wrong with that?	I'm not sure about this.	I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
"""You're still here?"""	"""I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."""
"""Really?"""	"""My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."""	"""So... surprise""..."	"""I can call them... I can call my dad... """	"""But you won't..."""
"""You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."""	"""You know what I want...it's not that difficult."""	"""Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... """	"""What about you? What will your dad think about you?"""	"""Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."""	"""Before what?"""
"""Before I kill you."""	"""Then they'd put you in jail."""
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?	I'm all right.	You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?	Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke.	Good luck!	When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.	Okay.
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!	But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.	You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
Don't stop!	What is it? What do you see?!	Those men in front, in the car.	Do you know them?!	No... but...	Keep going. Go around to the back.
I don't think...	C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.	No.
Rita... I know what you're doing.	What ... I..HAVE... to do.	I know what you have to do, but let me do it.
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.	But I want to.	No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.	It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.	Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.
To my audition.	And who are we auditioning for today?	Wally Brown.	And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?	No, we don't.	Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?	Yes, Sir.	Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?	Betty Elms.	Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.	Thank you... thank you very much.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.	No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.	My next delivery is up that way, so I'll be getting down to it real soon.
You're so easy.	Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.	Yeah, what for?	Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
What's  the matter now?	Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.	It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?	I just wanted to come here.	To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?	This Denny's.	Okay. Why this Denny's?
It's kind of embarrassing but,	Go ahead.	I had a dream about this place.	Oh boy.	You see what I mean...	Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.	Well ... it's the second one I've had, but they were both the same......they start out that I'm in here but it's not day or night. It's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but I'm scared like I can't tell ya. Of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. You're in both dreams and you're scared. I get even more frightened when I see how afraid you are and then I realize what it is - there's a man...in back of this place. He's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. I can see him through the wall. I can see his face and I hope I never see that face ever outside a dream.
So, you came to see if he's out there?	To get rid of this god-awful feeling.	Right then.
You feel it?	Yeah.
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.	Two men... two guns in the Caddy.	The boys found this on the floor in back of the Caddy.
Yeah, they showed me	Could be unrelated.	Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?	No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.	That's what I'm thinkin'.
Nice wallets.	Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.	The one of 'em still alive?	Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.	Oh yeah.
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.	Find out who they are?	Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.	Interesting.	Yeah ... and they both use the same address.	Where at?	Palmdale.	Damn, that's a long drive.
So man, that's unheard of ... an accident like that ... who coulda foreseen that.	Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?	Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.	Making ends meet, huh.	Hardly.	Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.	Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.	It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.	Yeah, that's a funny story.
Not here...no thanks.	Not a coke or anything?	No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.	Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
No.  I haven't seen any.	A brunette? ... maybe beat up?	No...	You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?	Sure.
That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.	Where's the dock ?
And now ladies and gentlemen it's time for the fabulous CROCODILE SHOW !	Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.	Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?	Pick with expediency !
You must come in first place to move on !	Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
Is that it ?	Yeah, I'd say that's it.
Doesn't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man's infatuation with the stuff, but not you.	I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.	No one has a gun to your head.
Good morning. What do you have today ?	I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.	Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....	What's going on ?	Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.
Where are we ?	No time. Get him up.
Why should we trust you ?	I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
What about Matt ?	Leave him, he's dead.	No !
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?	Why should I ?	You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?	You're both embezzling. I saw the records.	Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !	Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.	I'm not fucking him..
Now where do we go ?	I don't know.
How do we get out of this room ?	We wait. This is an elevator.
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?	We have to climb up that.
There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.	You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
Come on, it works.	Give me a fucking.....
So where does this lead ?	No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.	So what do we do ?	I'm working on it.	Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?	It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.	First Bank ? But how ?	It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.	McCay knows ?	"Knows ? He watches every ""Guest"" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we."
What are you doing ?	I'm leaving.
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !	What ?	You took an awful big risk back there.	Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.	If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.	I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !	Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?	NO ! I wouldn't do that.	Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?	Why would he ? His parents are rich.
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.	I'm not listening.	Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.	You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.	Not listening !	Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.	I'm listening.	At the subway station, we can get into a power duct that my little shit head of an assistant doesn't know about.
What's the trick here ?	We drown.	Obviously, but what's the way out ?	Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.	How long till the room fills ?	I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
So why this ?	Excuse me ?	Why did you build this whole place ?	Is this really the time ?	Do you have something better to talk about ?	I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.	He hired you to build this place ?	I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
I was lured by all the money and I truly did convince myself that what I did was for justice. Since then, McCay has wanted to put anyone he can down here.	But how do you know if the people are guilty ?	I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.	Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?	It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.	So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?	There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?	Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.	There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.	What do you mean ?	McCay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but reveal everything. Like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses.....
And you believe that ?	I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.	Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?	This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.	How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?	What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?	I'm in charge of the conversions.  When First Bank buys another smaller bank, I'm in charge of converting them to our systems and way of doing things.
I... I .....	You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.	I wanted to let his family know....	Know what ? That it was your fault ?	It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...	So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.	Okay.
You okay ?	Fine...
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.	Let's go.
This is cute.	Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.	Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?	You don't. It's random, there no trick.	Great...
Where are we going ?	The Brooklyn Bridge.
I don't get it.	It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.
Do you know where you're going ?	Yes.
What was that ?	Girder, watch your head.
What about you ?	There's one more person here for me to visit.
Just stop it. End it here.	It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
What are you DOING here ?	I work here, remember ?	That was eleven years ago.	Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?	Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.	That's a shame.	Yeah a real shame.	Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.	Bye....
Are you Matthew Parker ?	Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?	That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.	Hey , Hey !
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.	43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.	Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?	Just shut the fuck up.
OUCH !!! GODDAMMIT that hurts !!!!	I told him not to sit down in there.....
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.	Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !	Trust me, if you open any door, you'll be dead a whole lot sooner.
Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?	Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.	And that's different than this because...... ?
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !	I don't help criminals.
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ?	Because of my charming personality ?
Is it over ?	Not quite....
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.	I'd get out of the water if I were you.	Why ?
I thought you made this place ?	I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
What's next Walt ?	A dragon.	So what happened ? Did you have a real bad theme park experience as a kid and this is your revenge ?
Be very, very quiet...	Are you hunting wabbits ?
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.	You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
An elevator ?	Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.
It's fine thanks.	Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?	Look pipsqueak, I'm having a real bad day here and we're just starting.
That's not to tough.	Look...
Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.	That's cute asshole.
Hey, try swimming. It works.	What the fuck are you talking about.	Swimming, you know, like in water, moron.
You okay ?	Ow...
This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?	Knock yourself out.	Thanks...
Is it over ?	Almost. Look, you two get out of here.	Where ?	In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.	Don't have to tell me twice.
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.	Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
Don't.	What ?	Don't eat at the console.	What ? Are you my mother ?	It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.	Yes, sir Mom.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.	You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
He'll never get it right. Try the Log Ride !	Not yet.	But, he's...	I said NO.
Stop the hydraulics.	Got it.
Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.	You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !
Hand me the 3/8ths.	Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?	When I think you're ready.	When will that be ?	When you are ready.	Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.	Trust is earned not given away.	RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.	Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.	I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?	No.
I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.	And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?	You did.	That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
What's wrong ?	I just want to double check the facts.
I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.	So ?	He already had a balance of $600,000.	He probably has a history of this shit.	Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....	Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?	Any priors ? Any police record ?	Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...	Parking tickets ? That's it ?	Yeah, but we're talking 43.	A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?	Checking........
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !	I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?	For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
Well ?	Fire the whole division.	Excuse me, sir ?	Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.	Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....	If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?	We will start work on it now sir.
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?	Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?	Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.	I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?	Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?	Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.	I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.	Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?	Of course.	"While I am not morally against these little, shall we say ""hobbies"", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?"	Zach, how old are you, son ?	I am thirty two.	And how much do we pay you annually ?	I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.	Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?	Yes sir.	I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.	Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.	Son, let's watch the tape.
That was rather.... disappointing.	"I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the ""guests"" might take longer to expire."	I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !	"But sir, most of the people we are putting into the ""Park"" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess."	"I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the ""guests"" being of the more nefarious type."	"That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested ""guests""."	"What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the ""Park"" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?"	"Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the ""park"" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing."	"That mail room kid was the longest lasting ""guest"" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another ""guest"" from the more athletic of our staff."	Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.	What do you mean sir ?	What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?	Sir ?	I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !	Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.	I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.	What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?	Do you think the assistant, what's his name...	John, sir.	Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?	Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.	That my boy, is the best part. Life on top of the world is boring... predictable. If I wanted life without chances, I never would have paid for Murderland. Now go. Make a formal proposal and see about the assistant. Find out if it's viable.
Zachary.	Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?	Good, sir.
Is it as good as I hope it is ?	Better, sir.
One moment dear...	Sir ?	Not you Zach.  Remember, my wife is asleep upstairs, dear.  Zach, am I gonna like what I see on this tape ? Is it the grandest of all the Park's tapes ?
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.	Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.	Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.	Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.	I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?	"We have new ""guests"" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?"	He's been expecting you.
No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?	What did you hear ?	Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.	I was.	Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?	There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.	I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?	What are you looking for ? A blow job ?	No. I am not a homosexual.	Then what do you want ?	"Have you ever considered running your own ""Park"" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession."	"I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new ""Park""."	We can't.
Are you happy with your salary and position ?	No I am not.	I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....	I'm listening.
So who are these people with the Boss ?	Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.	Aren't you the bitter one.
How long till the drug wears off ?	We should have another fifteen minutes at least.	Bruce has just awaken.	What ?????
What is Bruce doing ?	I don't know.....
What was that ?	He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !	We can't afford too many surprises.	He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
Will he make it out ?	Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
What's next ?	I have a turn for the worse for the team !	I do believe Mr. McCray will be most pleased with the tape of this one.
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.	I'll see that bet.
Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?	Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
Maybe you should get over fears.	Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
Look he figured it out !	I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
Look ! Look !	Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.	I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.	You're paying the bills.
Was that the Old Man ?	Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !	I can see that but where ?
That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.	<<belch>>	Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?	The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
Thank you very much.	Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.	I think I'll see hat action.
So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.	He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
What the ... ?	What happened ?	The power went out in half the park.	How can this happen ?	I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.	Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?	Yeah, right. He's stuck all the way over here
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !	Thank you.	I meant him.
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?	Excuse me, gentlemen
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.	I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...	Do you want to go out with me ?	It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?	Yes.	Really ? On a date ?	Yes.	This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.	As appealing as that sounds...	Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?	Sure.
Hello.	Hi. I brought some wine.	Thank you, won't you come in ?	Thanks.
What an incredible view !	Thank you.
Are you okay ?	Yes, Excuse me for a second.	You have a real nice place... how can you afford this working as a temp ?
Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.	If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?	I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.	Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?	Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.	Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?	My own sit down Star Wars arcade game. Wanna play it ?
Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !	Yahoo !!!!!
Not now, Mom.	Wake up, we're in trouble.
Hey... did we uhm, you know....	No ! Just get up. This is serious.
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?	What the hell kind of cop are you ?
I think we should follow him...	I just need to sit and think for a second.
Are you okay ?	Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ??	Which one, this door is locked !
I'm talking to you asshole !	Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
You don't have to sound so emphatic.	We just having our first date when you showed up.
How's your foot ?	"""How's your foot"" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?"
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !	Shut up ! It's me.	I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.	What ?	Nothing.
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?	Zach from work ?
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?	I'm fine.
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.	I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.	We made it !
What now ?	I want to go to sleep for about a month.	No, idiot. Where do we go now ?	Where are we ?
Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.	Come to the rescue again I see.
He was right behind me !	Who was that guy anyway ?
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?	Hey buddy. You okay ?	Of course I am. I feel the testosterone coursing through my veins.  Now that I've gotten the stitches removed from my arm and the chiropractor fixed my back.
Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?	No.	"Well, I think if you take several lines out of context, Star Wars becomes a very sexual movie. I mean listen to this.  ""Luke, at that speed will you be able to pull out in time ?"" or ""You came in that thing ? You're braver than I thought""."
No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.	Why don't you shut up now.	I'm going to go ahead and go now.
Good morning.	Good morning.	Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.	Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.	I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?	Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.	Were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office ?  I am sorry. Perhaps we should have dinner tonight to.... discuss your future.
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.	I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....	Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.	Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
You had to remind me?	Are you writing a poem?	No, I'm writing to the phone company because they keep charging me for calls to Caracas, Venezuela...do you know any know anybody in Caracas, Venezuela?
Umm, where do you want this?	Oh, just put it over there.
Do you still teach?	No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.	UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.	Her name was Maggie Muldovan.	Ohhhhh.
People said she looked like me.	I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.	I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.	Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.	No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.	Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
Excuse me I asked you a question.	I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.	You're Vada right?
How did you know my name?	Your Uncle Phil told me.	Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.	Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?	This is California, anything is possible.	Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??	Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.	My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.	Gee, that is a problem.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!	What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?	I don't think you're very polite.	Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
THANK YOU.	Don't mention it.	I don't even know your name.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?	I would do it again in a minute.
Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.	What about giving the other guy a break.	What about living in the real world pal?
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.	I thought I told you to lose this guy.	Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...	I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.	I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.	You're still asking me to break the law.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?	Me, I'll know!
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.	What do you remember about her.	Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.
Wow, you walked out with my mother?	You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.	Suspended from school, my mother??	Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks.
I'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians.	His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....	Pommeroy.	Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.	I'm leaving Sunday.	Could you hold on for a second?
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?	Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.	Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.	I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
Do what?	Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....	You want me to move?	Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
Okay, no problem.	Okay thanks, atta girl.
Visualize a spare?	Well you know what I mean.	So, what's on your mind?	Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?	You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.	No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
Shelly's already told me all about sex.	She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.	I figured you did.
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.	No it's okay, I understand, really.	Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.	Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.	Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.	Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.	Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.	Seriously?	Seriously.	Great.
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?	What boy likes you?	It's just a question, it's not about anybody.
So you're saying...What are you saying??	Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer	Her favorite poet.
There's still a big spot on the floor.	Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!	Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?	Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.	Was it a nice funeral?	Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?	Of course.	I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.	Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....	I already bought a ticket.	What??	I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.
No nuns, got it.	And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
What does that mean?	It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.	Thanks, I needed that.	I'll be back in 137 hours.	Have fun.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.	Hi Dad.	Hi honey.	I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.	Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.	Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
Yeah.	Totally groovy huh?	Totally.	Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.	I will. How's Shelly?	Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...	Okay...bye daddy, I love you.	I love you too sweetie, bye.	Give my love to Shelly.
What happened to Shelly?	She just had a baby that's all.	We have a baby?	Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.	Can I see him?	You can do anything you want. You're his sister.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.	If I eat it I'll throw up.	Well you should at least try a little bit.	Then I'll throw up a little bit.
I don't know if I want to.	Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.	Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?	Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.	Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
Never heard of him.	How about a nice glass of milk?	And some taco chips so I can dunk.
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?	No.	Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up under the Christmas tree.
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.	She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...	Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.	You're being narrow-minded.
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.	Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.	I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
Reason? What reason?	Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.	I was pushing as fast as I could.
Maybe he's wet?	Maybe he's hungry.
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?	Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
It's okay really, I was just a baby.	I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
Thanks.	I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.	Oh.  Ohhh?	What're you saying?	Ummmmm, look, I...I...	Are you saying my mother had another husband?	Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.	They sure did! They got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure glad I came all the way out here to find them out.
Sure am, who are you?	I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...	Maggie...Maggie's little girl.
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.	You mean, you knew about me?
Umm...can you come in for a minute?	I'd like to, thanks.
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.	Does she?
I'm glad you're here.	You are?	Yeah, come on, let's talk.
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....	Hillary Mitchell? How's she?	Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.		I told you it was a long story.	That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.	Special effects?	Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.	I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.	I'll try.
And she saved it.	Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.	Do you have any pictures if her?	I've got something better.
She's beautiful.	We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?	More than anything in the world.	It's good to see Maggie again...and you.	Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?	Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.	I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.	I'd say you turned out just fine.	I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.	Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?	Well...	Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.	oh.	She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.
Hi.	Come on in!	That's okay.	It's just a corpse.	I know that.	You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
My mother can't have any more kids.	Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
What are you staring at?	It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.	See you? He can smell you from there.	Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
What's the matter?	He likes you.	Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.	Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.	That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?	I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
Hi.	Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?	ehh...I don't know I mean....
Then what did she do?	Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
So she had you in jail, in Russia?	Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
Is it okay if I drink this?	It's okay with me, hi Kevin.	Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.
Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.	But I wanna write about her.	You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?	No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??	No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.	All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?	That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
Hello.	Hi.	What can I do for you?	Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.	Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.	Then I have come to the right place.	I guess you have.	I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.	Rose.
This is really very nice of you.	It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.	O.K. Thank you very much.	Happy hunting.
He's writing. Hello?	If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.	You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you?
Hi there...can I help you?	Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
Vada?	The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
Vada what about you, who have you come up with?	My mother.	Your mother?	I never met my mother.
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?	Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.	You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.	Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.	I'm sure she did.
Thanks	Give it back Nicholas!	But we made a business deal.	What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
Nicholas! What are you doing up?	I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.	There's water in your bathroom.	I want juice!	Don't wake up Vada.	I won't.
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.	You're so clever.
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!	You're over reacting!	Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.	MOM!	You think this is easy for me? You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I don't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent if you don't do your job as a kid.
Thanks....	No THANKS!	He said it was a gift.	Yeah, RIGHT.	I don't need you to be telling me to...	TAXI!!!
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.	And you're gonna solve the mystery?	I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.	I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.	I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.	Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
Getting off please.	Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.	It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!	Vada.	WHAT??	Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.	Just remember the needle in the haystack.	I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?	What difference does it make?	A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.	Oh my gosh, here it is!
Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.	Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.	It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.	I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.	I'd never do that.	Get married?	Change my name.	What, you think the guy should change his name?
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.	What if you don't wanna be found?	Why do you argue with everything I say?
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.	Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
You ratted on my mother??	Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
Care for a smoke?	This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.	I think it's cool.	You would.	You'd rather have a mother that's a member of the police state? Rules are made to be broken.  Just ask him.
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.	May I use the phone please.
Boy, you're really into this.	He is one of the great poets.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.	At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.	And I thought I was weird.	You are weird. Let's just go.	Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.	This isn't just a mood ring.	Does it work?	Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.	Boyfriend?	Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?	Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.	Let me see if it changes colors on me.	ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.	Don't force it, you'll break it.	I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.	I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.	Give it to me!	Come and get it.	Just give it to me!!	Just come and get it...right here!	DON'T, come on!!!
Woah, watch it!	DON'T!!!	Uh oh...	What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???	...I dropped it.	In the tar??	It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.
Where are you going???	Owh...
What are you doing? You can't go in there!	Oh no?!?!?!
It's dangerous!!	Leave me alone!!
You mean,  this ring?	Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
Never heard of her.	Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.	Here's Judy Garland!
My mother stood on this very spot.	I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.	That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.	Big deal.
What's he smoking?	What do you think?	Really?
Hey look!	This is a totally barbaric custom.
Right.	And you'd be my cousin?	Yeah I guess...sort of.	But we wouldn't really be related right?	Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.	Good. I mean...	Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?	I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
It's not his fault!	No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.	He's an undertaker.
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.	Like what?	Maybe this Jeffrey guy is...is my real father. I mean...look at me, I have the hair of a dead person and...and my nose, no one in my family has this nose, it could be the nose of...a...of a complete stranger,
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?	Nick?	Yeah?	This has been a real confusing day.
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.	You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.	Some sacrifices are worth it.	You mean...it wasn't that terrible?	I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...	An adventure?	Part adventure...part miracle.
Write me a poem?		No?	I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.	Good-bye, look in your backpack.
Muh??	I'd consider it a personal favor.
What's that?	Ten bucks.	What's it for?	For the mini-bike fund.	Wow!	Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.	No problem.	You're a good man Nicholas.	Phil, I think you should consider... fades as Vada walks off
Well Rose was being very thorough.	Was Rose.
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.	Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....	I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.	Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.	Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.	You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.	I don't think the color of the interior is....	Rose this not the place to be having this...
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?	They're great.	How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?	He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.	Uh huh, well...good to know. Phil hands Nick a               5 note
She lives here too?	Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....	But...are you engaged or something?	Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.	That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?	Committed?	Committed.	So does that mean that you sleep here every night?	Yes, it does.
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.	Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....	I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
Lock the door.	Bye.
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...	Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.	How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....	I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.	Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?	I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
Maybe.	Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.	A secret, I like that.	This is it I guess.	Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.	You want me to come with?	I should do this myself.	Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.	Okay.
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.	Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.	Sounds great, well you give 'em both one of these for me.
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.	Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?	Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna stay.
Then you'll be all set.	Sounds like you're very organized.
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.	Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?	He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...	He was caressing.	Phil for God sake.	God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.	Oh...what's that?	Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
Hi!	Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.	Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight.	There's plenty of fruit.	You know where the fire extinguisher is.
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?	I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?	Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.	No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.	You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?	I don't want anything you don't wanna give me.
I think this place is just fine.	You know how I feel about you.	You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice.  PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
You really think I look sexy in this smock?	Is that a yes?
You're Nick's mother?	What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
I'm just tired.	All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?	Not exactly.	Well just don't shave your legs...he'll never let you visit us again if I send you home hairless and full of holes.
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.	She'll be all right baby.	Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.
Bye Aunt Rose.	Bye Niece, Vada.
So what's wrong?	Nothing, nothing at all.	I mean...with your car.	Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.	Excuse me?	I was commenting on your hair.	Oh, are you a hairdresser?	I'm a pediatric cardiologist.	Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?	Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?	Yes, I do.	...so I guess I'll always...teach...you know...'cause it makes a good relief from the operating-room, I feel I have an obligation...
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.	I'll be here.
Good morning.	Well maybe for you.	Something wrong?	Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.	Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.	You couldn't?	Well I'm sort of involved.	Sort of?	Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.	Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.	Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.	All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.	Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.	Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.	Oh, sure okay.	I'll see you then...I look forward to it.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.	I bet your mom sang to you.
They're enormous, I know.	Is there milk in them already?	No, the milk comes when the baby comes.	When did you umm, I mean umm...	Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.	Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.	I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.	You're telling me.
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.	Oh no.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.	Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
What's this? December 8th, 1958?	I don't know, Dad doesn't either.	Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.	This is one of my favorite things, her passport.	Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?	No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.	Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?	Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.	I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.	Well you've gotta be prepared.	I'm definitely traveling some day.
Why not now?	What do you mean?	How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.	But what about you and the baby? You need me.	Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.	Yeah, it would be kinda great.	It would be fantastic.	But Dad'll never go for it.	You leave your father to me.
Shelly?	Hey! Oh look.	He's so tiny.	I know, look at his little hands.
Did it hurt a lot?	You have no idea.
Let me hold him.	O.K.
Really?	Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
Beidermeyer?	Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.	He's a great poet.	He is?	Do you know him?	Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.	He'll remember my mother for sure.  STANLEY It was a big class Vada and...but...well of course he'll remember, who could forget Maggie?
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.	Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.	I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.	This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
Arthur!!	Vada!!	I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.	Good for you baby.	Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.	I like to buy off all the railroads.
Wanna play?	No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.	Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
Hey, you didn't pay me!	How do I know you were gonna show us one?	You're such a baby.	All right, here.
Of what??	Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?	Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....
Danny?	WHAT?	Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.	This guy bonking you?
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?	It's her home! It's where she lives!!	Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,  Gimme the goddam keys.
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?	Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?	You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home.
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.	Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.	Keep your voice down!	What?	The boss is watching us...	I'm impressed.	God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.	Yeah, all right...
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...	Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
Ex...ex, ex...	My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
You are perfectly healthy.	That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.	Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?	Yes.	Vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you!
Can't you see it?	No.	It's there.	Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??	Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?	I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.	Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.	What Hurts Vada?	The bee stings! I can't breathe!
It's still available I hope?	I think it's still available.	I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.	Uhh, Miss devoto...	I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.	Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.	They're dead?	Yes they are.	Stiffs??	Deceased.	The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
Excuse me, what about the job?	Pardon?	I need the job.	Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...	Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.	You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.	Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.	Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....	I promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks.
Uh huh?	Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?	Yeah.
You don't like it?	This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.	I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.	She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.	I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.	That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.	What do you mean??	Well the other night at dinner...	Oh that, she just likes to play.	I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.	She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.	Harry, I really think she.....	She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.	Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.	Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.	I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.	After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.	I'm sure she will.
Hi.	Oh Hi, what can I do for you?	Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.	Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.	Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.	I wrote that.	No kidding?
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.	I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.	In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.	It's no big deal.	You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?	I haven't been to the movies in AGES.	I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in.  I'll let you get back to work.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.	Okay.
Does it make it easier to win?	No. Just, more activity.
I just had a terrible thought Harry.	What's that?	I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.	Why d'you think these seats were empty.
Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.	Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.	Kinda like men.	Oh, how do you mean?	You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
I had a good time tonight.	I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.	Okay, sure.
Home sweet home.	It's nice.	I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.	Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.	You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush.
Yeah.	Are you mad at me?	No, why?	I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...	Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.	What happened to her?	Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.	Did she ever see Vada?	I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....
Dance with me?	Here?	This is where we are.	Is there enough room?
I haven't danced in.....	In ages, I know, me neither.
Rock?	See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.	At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue.
What are you wearing?	Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
Do you want to?	Want to what?	Kiss me.	Yes.	Good.
I ahh, better go.	It's only eight o'clock.	Goodnight Shelly.	Goodnight.
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.	Goodnight.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.	Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?	Not at all. Lot of potatoes!	It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.	I'm looking forward to that.
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.	Really?
How's it going chef?	Okay.
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.	I'll second that.
Shelly?	Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!	Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Well, you were pretty great!	Is it really your camper?
Can we see it from the back yard?	You can get the general idea...
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...	Pointing upwards Look...	Did you ahh, love him?	I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
Watch you don't knock out a fish.	Perfect.	I don't know which ball's mine.
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.	I know that, but what do you want from me?	Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;	Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.	I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.	O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
Ahem.	Vada, just put 'em on the stool.
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.	Ya, that rack holds six ties.
Vada, we're trying to work here.	Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!	Hand me the canula.
VADA!	Dad?	I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing.  All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle.....
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?	They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.	Is it for a child?
Of course not.	Then who's it for?
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?	That's a lot of money for a little girl.	It's for school, for summer writing class.	Any more soda left?
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.	Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
Dad?	I love this guy!	Dad??	What?	The money?	Ahh, maybe next summer.
Goodnight Vada.	Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?	Ahh, I just wanna look nice.	You never cared before.	Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.	Why?	She likes to play bingo.	Can I go too?	Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.	Sorry.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?	Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
Are they ready yet?	No, sweetie, not yet.
When?	Soon honey, soon.
When??	In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
Yes..	Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
I like the freak show.	I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.	Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
I fall asleep at the wheel.	I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
Hi Vada.	Hi.	What are you doing.	Feeding my fish.	Is that the fish you won at the carnival?	Yes.	He's getting big.  Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.	I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.	No sweetheart, you can't.	Why not?	He was allergic to bees.	He's okay isn't he?	There were just too many of 'em.
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!	Get away, get away!!
Did I kill my mother?	What??	The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.	No, no.
I found this.	I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?	In the garage.	Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.	What was my mama like?	She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.	Really?	Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.	Do you miss her?	Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.	I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.	That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
Well well well, what's going on in here?	Nothing, I'm dressing.	Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?
Oh yes, oh that's great.	I'm very nervous.	Why?	The last date I had was twenty years ago.	That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!	Oh come on.	Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.	Are you sure about all this?	Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?	Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.	Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.	No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?	Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.	That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??	No, no no....	Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
Hi.	Hi, is Vada home?	Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.	Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.	Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.	Will you tell her I came by?	Sure.	Thank you. Bye.	Bye.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?	It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.	Really? Already? The summer's just begun.	Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.	No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?	Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.	This is one big house for one single person.	Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet.	How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?	Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.	How much does it cost?	Thirty five dollars.	What do you get for that?	Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?	No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.	It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
I paid the money.	For this class?	Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.	Vada, this is an adult writing class.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.	I wrote a poem too.	Please.	Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?	Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.	Come here, sit down over here.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.	Oh, Vada...	I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.	Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.	No he wouldn't, I can't go home.
Who's that?	That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
No....	I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....	Get away from me!
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.	We'd love to hear it.	Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.	Cool, can I get one for Vada?	Oh yes, yes.
Cause she's dying.	Do you think she is?	No.	Why do you think she says that?	Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.	You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.	He likes her.	Does he love her?	Probably.	Do you like her?	Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.	Why?	After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.	Really?	Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.	My Dad was funny?	Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
Is that your camper?	Yes it is.	That's really cool.
She's shy.	Oh.
Who's winning?	I am.
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.	I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
He's allergic to everything.	Chocolate?
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.	It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
Maybe black means you're happy?	I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
Shut your big fat mouth!	I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?	He won't give it to me.	Well you don't know that. Ask him.
Vada? VADA?? What happened??	My ball, I lost my ball.	Come on sweetie.
Hi.	Can we look around in your camper?	Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
Big Ringo fan.	Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?	I would.	Thomas?
Did you read ALL these books?	Uh huh.	What are they about?	Mostly love, and romance.
Are you married?	No, I'm divorced.	Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.	Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?	Can I use your bathroom first?	Sure.	You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.	Okay.
Are you going out somewhere?	No.	So how come you're putting lipstick on?	A girl's always gotta look her best.	I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.	Have you ever tried any?	No.	Come here, sit down.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?	Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.	The boys at school don't think I am.	They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.	Do you like putting makeup on people?	Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.	Aarrggh.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.	Hi.
Hey Shelly, like seafood?	Uh huh, why?	See food!
I like my name.	This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.	Are you here to take Shelly back?
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.	Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.	Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.
I won, I won!!!	Oh great!!
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?	NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
NO!	Yes!!
Daddy??!?!?!	Vada, Vada, what's the matter?	Where's Daddy?	Well he just left, what's wrong?	I'm hemorrhaging.	What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?	I don't want, I don't need your help....
How old are you?	I'm eleven and a half.	It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?	It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.	I think it should be outlawed.	Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
It's okay sweetheart.	I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.	I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.	I will I promise.	Okay, get in to bed.
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
Thomas J?	I'm allergic to it.	To chocolate?
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?	Uh huh.	I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.	Liverpool?
Eeeeuuuww, gross.	They're just fun to read.
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.	What are you saving for?	Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.
Oh great!	Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
I knew he wouldn't come.	I can't, I have to go home.
Hey look at this, no feet!	Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
At what?	That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.	I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!	Hi Mr. Bixler!
No, I'm going home.	Why? It's not dinner time yet.	Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
It doesn't work, it always stays black.	It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.	It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.	She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.
Maybe they had a big breakfast.	I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.	Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!	Oh no!  UUH.	Hurry!	I'm trying.	Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.	I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.	Hey, we can become blood brothers.	Naah, I don't wanna.	You could pick that scab on your arm.	It's a mosquito bite.	It'll bleed.	If I do it, can we go?	Uh huh.	Okay, OW!
Your lip bleeding?	No.	What's wrong with your eyes?	A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.	Where's your bike?	Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
Hey look at this!	That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.	No, I don't wanna.	Come on, it's fun.
Hmmmm, interesting.	What?	You have no personality.	Hey, where does it say that?	Never mind.
Is that your Dad?	Yes.	Who's that with your Dad?	It's my mother.	Do you remember her?	No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.	What do you think it's like?	What?	Heaven.	I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.	But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?	It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.	That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.
Here.	Don't DO that!!	Sorry.	What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.	Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.	I told you i'll get in trouble.	Pacifist!	I am not.	Bed wetter!	I stopped that!
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.	We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.	Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.	Duck!
Can we go yet?	Go???	You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
Hey Vada, guess what we got?	What?
THIS!!	HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
Woah!!	What?	Pointing There's a beehive right there!	So?	Stand back.
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!	You're right, let's knock it down.	What do you want it for anyway?	For their meat.
Got it!	My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
Run faster they're after us!!	I am running faster!!	Hurry!!!
Jump in the water!!	But I have my clothes on!	Do it!
Hi Vada.	Hi, wanna ride bikes?	Sure.
Come on, let's go.	Bye Mrs. Sennett.	Bye Ma.
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.	I wanna live with them too.	No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.	Really?
Get up!?	I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
Why are you running away?	My Dad gave Shelly a ring.	Wow, was it a decoder ring?	You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.	They're getting married?
So now you'll have a mother.	I don't like her.	I do, she's real funny.	He likes her better than me.	I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.	Then go home, baby.	I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.	Leave then, some friend you are.	You can come to my house for dinner?	No, I'm hiding out.	Okay, seeya.
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.	Hi Vada, can you come out?	I dunno..	Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
Well when you get older, you just have to.	I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.	You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.	It is not.	Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.	Not true.	Have you ever kissed anyone?	Like they do on TV?	Uh huh.	No.	Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.	But, I don't know how.	Here, practice on your arm like this.
Like this?	Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.	Close your eyes.	But then I won't be able to see anything.
Just do it.	Okay, okay.	Okay on the count of three.
Say something it's too quiet.	Umm, Ummmmm	Just, hurry.
You better not either.	Well, let's spit on it.	Okay.
Seeya tomorrow.	Okay, seeya.  Vada?	What?	Would you think of me?	For what?	Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
Yeah, it's in the contract.	Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.	I should look different.	You should look like you dressed yourself.
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?	Something like that.
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.	Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
What?	I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
Stay, huh?	I honestly wish I could...	I'll call George's parents. Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me.
You don't miss much.	Part of being a New Yorker.
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?	If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?	I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.	Which is everyone you couldn't get in.	Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
Needs salt.	Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...	... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.	... weeks.
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.	The wandering sportswriter.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.	Kindred spirits.	No, he's nothing like me.  He's like you.  Only straight.
He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.	He's still in love with you.
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.	Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
I've lost interest.	He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
Blood oath.	"He says, ""Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"""
You think...	Desperate.  To talk.
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...	Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
He can't do that to me!	We're about to find out.
We'll never be the same.	I have a suggestion...	I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.	No, he's ruining yours.	Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.	You have a real philosophy of life.	It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.	I can see why.	She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.	Chill?  Since when do you say ch...	When I'm talking to children.
You flew all the way h...	I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.	You're butting in.
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.	You like her.	If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her.
I was devastated.	Go figure you.	"Because I realized.  When I see him say ""I do,"" that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every..."
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...	You've been working on this, huh?	"... and having ""done the right thing"" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times."
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.	And you believe that.	Sure.
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.	It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...	I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!	Impressive.	I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!	The man you love.	Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!	Someday she'll thank you.	Let's not get carried away.
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...	I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
Zit cream?	I wish.	Neosporin?	Try less appropriate.	Ben Gay.	That was Thursday.
Elmer's Glue?	DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
I give.	I can't even say it.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?	What do you suggest?
I suppose it's too late to start over.	It's too late to start over.
Two words.	Major.  Dish.	Manicure...
You're going to say it, aren't you?	Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.	I'm taking my next book to Viking.	Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.	I'm moving this book to Viking.	Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.	Needing.	To belong to someone.
Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  But there it is, and he has to choose.	And what will he do?
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.	Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
I did what I came to do.	Good girl.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.	Oh, you're more than okay.
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...	Well, we're...	I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...	You need a few dollars.
Excuse me?	I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
But I can't be dry.	Can you watch the road?	See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...	... you want a menage on your wedding night.
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.	Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!	Which was the disqualifying factor?	The twin part.  I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.	Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
What else did he tell you...	... you hate weddings, you never go.
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.	He said that, too.
Don't you have to be somewh...	... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...	What? Because I'm a little understand...	... most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after their wedding.  Just to top it off.
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...	So your honeymoon is exactly where?
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...	... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...	... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
How about...	... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
He sucks soup through his front teeth.	A trademark move, don't touch it.	But he sure can kiss.	It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.	After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
And loving him means loving all of this.	Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?	So it's sweet of you to be protective...	Let me rephrase that...	But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...	Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...	... except one.
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...	Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...	I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.	No.	And the answer was so simple.	I was gonna predict that.	You win.
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.	I've missed a step.	He has you on a pedestal.  And me in his arms.
Jesus, we're trapped!	Ju...	No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...	... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...	Stop, we're embarrassing h...	... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
About Michael's job.	Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...	I just think you're wrong, is all.	Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
I mean, he loves his job.	Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
But he always says...	... whatever is manly and independent.
For the twins? What in the world is th...	Gold nose hair clippers.
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.	Hello.
So... one almost has to...	Exactly.	Exactly what?	What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
He'll see right through it.	Only.  If he wants to.
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...	He won't get mad, huh?
Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...	I just don't want to freak him out.
Uh, Kimmy...?	We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...	They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?	This must be... very, very, hard on him.	What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?	Don't you see...	"If you're waiting for ""Do you take this man?"", that's considered poor form."	... that this is all my fault?
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...	I love him.
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.	WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?	Have you ever heard of. Irony?
I never want to go through this again.	That's entirely understandable.
Have you sized up the groomsmen, Jules?  As M. of H., you get first fuck.  Don't pick the short, hairy, rich one.	... unless he has a hump.
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...	... look good on Kimberly.	Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.
I saw the show.	... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.	It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?	Oh, she's slipped out, the little monkey.  Prob'ly with Michael, doin' the nasty.
Ex-cuse me?	I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...	You are <u<so right.  What a nerve on that guy!  Bring my dress to church, huh?
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.	I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.	Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.	Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.	I think you're making a mistake, sir.
Is anybody watching?	I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...	Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.	I know Ben.
I think he's been fired.	It doesn't say th...	He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
And you think he's kept this to himself.	He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
Maybe.  I should call Ben.	Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
I thought Michael was picking me up.	I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?	Nobody has.  So far.
Well, you're a little early...	I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
I've been calling for days!	Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...	You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
And she's all wrong for me!	Well, somet...	I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you.
Well, sure.	But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...	You've met her parents.
Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su...	Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such.
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...	... Thomas, yeh.
Well, maybe we should talk ab...	I need you.
Please come, please.	W...	I can't wait for you to meet her!
What's the sec...	Mirrors.
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.	Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...	... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.	Such as.	She's too genuine.	Hate that.	How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?	What's next?
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.	Endearingly absent-minded.	My very point.  Here's another one...
Every day.  She makes the bed.	Quite the little eccentric.	At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...	She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.	Waiter! Check, please!	"She finds him ""personable."""	Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...	First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
Where was that, Florence, huh?	Firenze.
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?	Till the gas ran out.
Should I whistle down a cab?	Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.	What, leaving school...	... all of it.  She's leaving her family, her friends, everything she knows.  She's putting her career on hold, and she seems a pretty ambitious, driven, kind of pers...
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...	She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...	I got the point.
Still.  All's fair in love and w...	That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
You're not eating.	I never eat when I'm serene.	You never eat when you're despondent.	I switched that around when you weren't looking.
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.	Boy, those were the days.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...	You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?	Never can tell.
Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...	Michael!!
"No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's ""needs,"" and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society."	Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...	Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.	Like I said, dazzling.
Big weddings are so strange.	You keep saying that.
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.	Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
You miss her, huh?	No.  I've got you.
Don't you throw up on boat?	If you like.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.	Have you.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...	It's more than that.
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.	You've been the man in mine.
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?	Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.	Except for that.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.	Me either.
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.	I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
Dance card filled?	I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
Where did we first hear th...	The night we met.
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...	We danced to it.  Just like this.
Takes me back.	Well.
No accents today.	Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
Will she like it?	Yes.
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...	ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
I'm up against a deadline.	Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.	That's my point!!
I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.	It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...	Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?	You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
This thing means that much to y...	It means a lot.
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...	... maybe it's congratulations.
Michael? What ha...	Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...	"""Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."""	I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.	"""Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."""
What happened?	It's over.
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.	A bad combination.
Michael...	No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.	Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...	The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...	I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?
Or we'll go somewhere.  If you have the time.	If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...	Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...	But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!	She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?	Get married, apparently.
This is her family and her fault.	And your point?	Well.  How come she didn't...	BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
I asked you...	She admits it's her fault.
Does that make it right...	Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
Thank God you were here.	Oh, yeah.	I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.	Well, it happens.
... your one chance for true happiness?	... yeah, that.	You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover.  As they say in the sport biz.
The Big Hurt, huh?	Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
What's up?	Shhh.
Jules, what's wrong...	This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
Uh.  I saw that moving...	DON'T SPEAK!
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...	... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.	ARE YOU CRAZY?
I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?	I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...	Lower.	Lower.	The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...	I came here, looking for her.
Why would she come here...	This is where I proposed.
I never forgot that.	It's two weeks.	Almost three.	That is so romantic.
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...	Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...	I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.	That's little egotistical.
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...	If you find her...
The kiss.  May be hard.  For you to explain.  Because the only fear she really has, is...	... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...	I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...	The most important thing. Is being together.
Because I could come...	To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
It's not just a gag, huh?	No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...	... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...	Like family, huh?
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...	To him.
And to m...	... and you knew about this.
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...	Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!	What is that sup...	And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love.  How inconvenient.
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!	Well, if that's the way you f...	"Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says ""Mikey-poo""? Or do I have to change my name to ""Binky""?"
Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...	MICHAEL!!
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...	... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...	Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...	... I'm partial to the tight end.	This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.	With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
Maybe it's happy there.	Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?	He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.	An so it is.
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.	You're much more his type.
You got the money?	Right here.	Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.	Well, that just happened that time.	Well, it better not happen again.
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.	You got a real good memory, Star.	I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.	What do you have to buy?	Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.	Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.	What?	Grand Old Opera --	I hate that music.	I know that, Star.
Winifred.	Hi! Star.	Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.	I won first prize.	Come on.
You're from out of town?	Yes. I'm cutting a record.	We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.	Is there food?	No.	Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.	No, those are socials you're thinking of... Saturday's usually.
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.	I see.
Barnett, please -	What's wrong honey.	I don't want to listen to her sing -	Don't feel that way, honey.	Then why are you listening to her -	Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.	You have to what?	Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
Barnett?	What?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.	Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?	All those people...
Don't worry, I'll take care or it	You're so good.
Am I disturbing you?	I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.	How did you come in here?	"Well, my wife, Ester's down the hall. I saw Barnett leaving and I was just talking to Ester about your being here.	She loves you so much, I just had to come down and say hello. We've been following you since you were a girl. Well, I just scared you to death. I didn't mean to do that."
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.	You'll have to speak up.
I said, I've been real tired.	Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.	What's wrong with her.	Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.	What did you say your name was?	Green.
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.	I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.	You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
You going today?	Thank you-- Yes, I am.	I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.	You get her those Vitamin E right away.	I got them right here.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.	Bye, Bye.
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.	She's going to rest now.	Okay, I just wanted to see if I could help out at all.
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.	Oh, sure.
What do you really want?	Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.	You bet.	Okay. Thanks.
Yes.	Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?	She's fine.	Well, I just thought I'd call.	Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.	Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.	I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.	He knows better.	Well, it's probably because it would help him.	How is that?	Everybody likes to be as good as their word.	Whose word?	His Word.	His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?	That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?
What?	They can come to the concert in the park.	I said 'no!'
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.	Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.	No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?	Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.	Your job, huh.
How is she?	A little slow, but she'll be fine.	Have you talked to Triplette?	Who the hell is he?	He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.	Who the hell is he?	He's going to run for president.	Third party?	He has that sign with the tree.	What does he want?	Barbara Jean.	What!	That's what he wants.	You know better than that.	It's on National television, Barnett.	I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
Well, how about the shopping center?	Yes. She's pretty rested up.	Okay, then we'll see you there.	Okay.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.	Hi. Come on in. Mary!
You want anything?  A drink?	Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.	Don't you worry. We're just having a quiet Sunday at home.
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.	Whose?	Hal Phillip Walker.
What's he running for?	President.
National television?	ABC.	How much?	Minimum.
Where'd he ever see us?	D.C.	D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?	Sure thing.
Okay.	Okay.
Bastard	Stop it!
President?	When is it?
It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.	Bill, he's a crazy man.
You're kidding.	How come?
Yes, but we're just singing.	Sue was trying to get hold of you.
Howdy.	Where the hell have you been?
Where are you going?	To the bathroom.
Hey!	It's the den mother.
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...	National?	Yes. Percy Warner Park'.
Come on. He's a crook.	What crook?
He saw us at Tammany Hall.	The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
Sorry to bother you, Bud.	Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.	Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.	Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.	She's in Paris.	Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?	Not yet.	Let me know when you do, all right?
You bet.	I'll just be in here.
He's my father.	Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
He got killed at a turkey shoot.	Your brother?	Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.	Harvard?	Business School so I can run Haven's business.	What is a turkey shoot.	You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey	How in the world did he get shot?	Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.
Do you know Barbara Jean?	Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.	Haven's not going to talk to me.	Sure he will.
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.	Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.	That's good,  I've never seen anything so healthy.
Well, Mr. Green.	Hi, Sherry.	How'd you get in here.
Mr. Green?	Yes, ma'am. How are you today?	Didn't you get?... How are you?	I'm fine. Can I go up?	Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.
You want me to wait?	No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
What?	Your wire Ester - she passed away.
Yes, sir.	Can I help you?	Yes, sir. I need a room	I think we can do that. Come in.
I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.	She sure sings nice.	My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?	Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.	I'm not really a musician.
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.	Suits me.
Listen, do you know anything about cars?	A little. What do you need?
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.	Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.	Good night,
Did you see who that was?	Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.	He is just wonderful.	I'1l get your bag.
Uh huh.	She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
You know anything about the stations here?	It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.	All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.	Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.	What did you say?	I said, maybe I'll change my name again.	I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.	But not unless Nashville really inspires me.	Maybe you can look after me a little.	That Tom sure is cute.
What's this?	Replacement party.	Who's that?	A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.	How do you know?	Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -	You must really like him.	Well, he's really amazing.	I haven't gotten into politics yet. I'm still into music --except for you. You're into politics.
Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...	I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.	I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...	I don't really know what you're talking about.
Have you seen a woman about so high?	No.	She had on high heels?	No.	Need a ride?
Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?	No.	You got a place to stay?	No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.	You in music?	No.	Get in.
Wrecks.	Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.	We don't mess with accessories.	Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
Parts.	Do you carry door handles?	What kind?	Nash.	What year?	Sixty-three.
Mom?	I've been so worried, dear. where are you?	Nashville.	Oh... Well.	The car broke down.	Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.	Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.	Next you'll be sick.	I feel really good.	How are you going to pay when you get sick?	I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.	Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather	I don't know his first name.	Bet the sheets are grey.	No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.	Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.	Fungus?	He doesn1t have fungus, does he?	I don't think so.	Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.	How do you know if they do?
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.	Does their hair fall out?	Your hair fell out? Just like your father. Weak hair.
Listen. Maybe I should go...	I've been a Little dyspeptic.	I want to get the dog off my bed.	But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
Okay. I'll be talking to you.	Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.	Bye.	Bye.
Have your children been deaf since birth?	Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.	When did you start singing?	When I was little, in church.	Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?	Yes, it is --	Well, can you tell me why?	It just is.	How long have you been with them?	About three years.	And before?	Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.	Do you ever do any writing?	No, I don't.	Are you a close friend of Haven's?	No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.	Do you like him?	He's a member of our congregation.
Hello.	Linnea?	Yes. Who's this?	I'm here.	Who is this?	Tom. You remember?	I'm not sure. Where?	Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?	Yes.	Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...	Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
I'd really like to see you.	Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.	That's not quite what I had in mind.
Well...How have you been?	Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
Hello.	Hi.
Who is thin?	Who is this?  It's Tom.	I don't know who you are.	What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
Hello.	Wow!	What?	Who is this, right?  I called you last night.	Oh.	I've got a gig tonight.	Oh?	End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.	Doesn't it have a name?	I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.	I have to go.	Wrong.	I have to go. He sighs.	I know.
Stay.	I can't.	Car pool?
When did you think it would happen?	I'm not sure.	I knew when I first met you.	Oh.
How old are you?	Older.	Thirty?	Well...	I'm twenty-eight	Oh.	Older than thirty?
Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?	That's unkind.	Come on, you ever been attracted to a black guy?
I'll talk to you tomorrow.	That's what you said before.	I know. Goodbye.
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.	Oh.	Premeditated murder.	Oh.	Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?	I'm not sure...	I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?	What?	High?  Do you ever get high? A walk on the wild side. Ever do dust?
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.	Fifteen minutes?	Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?	What...?  0h, yes.	Not me. Ain't never loved anybody. Ain't never been married. Won't either.
You know who that is?	Yea.	I see.
My mother. died in '72. They told me after. They said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.	What?	They said go see the chaplain.	I'm sorry but I have to go.
Hello.	Linnea?	Yes.	You sound different. Is that really you?	It's me. What is it?	Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...	What time?	Eight-thirty in the chapel.	I'll be there.
I can do benefits	How much?
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.	Money's no object.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?	Hundreds of times.	Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.	Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.	Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
Hello. John Triplette.	Hello.	Glad to meet you.
Oh, no.	He's pretty well known down here.
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...	For him?	Yes.
What for?	You're real favorites of his.
What National TV...?	You're doing some recording here, aren't you?	An album.	Might be good for you.
You don't know how pleased he'll be.	What!
Sorry I'm late.	You're not.	Where's Bill?	Sleeping.	Where are you going?	Out.
How's your stomach?	Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?	Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...	They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
You know Bill is really mad at you.	Oh?	I mean...	Mary?
We just got a gold record.	Do they have a show to give it to you?	No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.	Did it break?	Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.	How long have you been together?	Probably a little too long.	Do you study at all?	Depends on what I'm studying.
Come on back to bed.	Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?	Come on.	Just a minute.
Hi.	Hello.	I'm Opal.	Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.	I'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. I just finished a documentary on Gandi.
The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks.	Why?	Why?	What?	What? Oh. A film.
Pleasure	Where is she?
What do you think of him?	Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.	You go to school together?	No, we never did that	Oh --	We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?	Well, I really think he's got a chance.	You do?	Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.	He ain't really new.	He is to a lot of people.	He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.	You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.	Where are you from?	Southern California.	You always live there?	Spent time in Arizona. Why?	Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?	I know a couple.	No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?	Ah... Peter Finch.	Who?	Peter Finch -- he's English.	I never heard of him. Name somebody else.	Ryan O'Neal.	You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?	Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.	I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?	Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.	I'll be dammed.
You want a ride into town?	You bet.
Got me an audition tonight.	Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.	You think I got any kind of a voice?
You sure do it loud.	Is that good?	It's not bad.	You think I should take lessons?	If you're serious. Being serious is real important.	You serious?	Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.	Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.	You think it will?	Sure thing.
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.	I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.	Oh, why thank you.	May I see your costume?
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.	I see.	I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious.
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?	Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
More or less.	More or less...
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?	Yes you are.	What was the color of Tim's belt?	The style of fighting that Tim studied didn't believe in belts.	Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?	Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.	Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?	Yes, I did. That's why Tim studied it. Because it was Bruce Lee's fighting style.
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.	That's what Tim said.	So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?	Yes, I would.
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?	Yes, they were.
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?	Yes, you are.
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...	What...
What kind of pies do you have?	Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.	Which do you recommend?	The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.	I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.	When ya had it, did ya like it?	No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk.
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?	It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.	What did you think then?	I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.	Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?	Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?	Try to keep it to a minimum.	We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.	How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.	Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.  So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.
Naw, she don't mind.	Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?	Are we in a big hurry?	You got something you want to do?	Yeah.	By all means, knock yourself out.	Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
Mickey!	Don't stop!
Hasn't it?	We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.
Divine intervention.	What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
Looked like an interview to me.	I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?	The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.	Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?	Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.	When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?	What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.	Who is we?	The prison board and the doctors who examined them.	Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?	Using the same doctors is not common practice.	I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?	Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.	Thank you, sir.	Dewight McClusky of the California Prison Board. Take a seat please.
Who isn't?	You been followin' the news coverage?	They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---	Susanville, Soledade.	They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---	Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.	I can appreciate that.	So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.	Lobotomy Bay?	You've heard of it?	So, how do I fit into this scheme?	The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?	By all means.	You're a celebrated cop. Twenty-six years on the force, a best-seller out on paperback...
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.	I see.	You write the script Jack, call it, 'Showdown in Mojave: The extermination of Mickey and Mallory', whatever... Have we found our man?
Who's the song bird?	Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.	Ain't love grand.
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?	How's it goin'?
Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.	Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.	Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.	I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'	What?
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.	She's in the holding cell, on this floor.	You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!
Yeah.	Okay, Wayne, step forward.
How come you never talk?	She was born without a tongue.	Oh my God!  Sorry.
Say something.	What?	Anything.
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.	There's a chocolate cream filled in there?	Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.	Tough titty, it's mine now.	Look, I'll trade you.
You guys stay on your bellies.	Yes, sir.
How is it?	Not good.	Do you have a back up.	It's video.	Even better. Wayne call your station, tell 'em we're going live a little early today. Make it happen!
You ready, Donut?	Ready.	Wagons, hooaaa!
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---	Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.	Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?	Yes.	Whose ratings were higher?	Yours.	How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?	Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.	Good...yuppie piece of shit.	What I'd like to do---	How 'bout Manson?	Manson beat you.	Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.	We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come.  I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?	Have you talked to Mallory about this?	She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.	She doesn't talk?	Not to anybody. She sings.	She sings? What does she sing?	Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's what I hear anyway. Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are you insane?' And she starts singing 'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road', that blows our whole case.
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?	I'm keen with anticipation.
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.	All right, Mickey.	Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.
Sorry about that.	Don't worry about it.	We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?	Let's do it.
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.	Aside from the obvious?
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?	What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.	What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.	Do you miss Mallory?	Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.	Then was it worth it?	Was what worth it?	Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?	No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?	Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.	Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?	That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.	Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?	You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?	Tell me about the purity.	It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.	Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.	I'm sure we will.	Describe Mallory.	Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...	Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?	That's indescribable.	Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?	Says who?	Says the United States of America.	When have they ever been right?
Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.	Okay, let's cut it.
I could go for a Coke.	Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?	Sure.	Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.	Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.	Scott's dead. And unless you wanna play follow the leader, shut up and do as you're told.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.	Yeah, we have a van.	Where's it parked?	Out front.	Let me have the keys.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?	No.	This is crazy. You can't escape like this.	Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.	We'll all be killed.
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?	On average forty million.	'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?	Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...	'Respected journalist'-- On your knees...
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?	Yes.
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.	Got it.
We ain't got all fuckin' day!	Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.	So, what now?
Just wait one fucking minute.	I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?	No. Not really.	Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---	Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.	We are.  Your camera.
Let's make a little music, Colorada.	NO!!!
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.	I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--	I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.	No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!	If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---	No fuckin' way!	Mickey, you're wasting time!	I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
Yeah baby.	You made every day like kindergarten.
Yes.	Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.	Yes.
How can you say that you 'admire' them?	It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.	Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?	They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.	And they made the first move?	Unfortunately, yes.
I admire them.	I do, too.
Hypnotizing.	Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
Through the power of the simple word---	And a snake-eye glare.	---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.	He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.	He had the edge. The mind's edge.	Mickey and Mallory have that edge.	Only on a much grander scale.	They've hypnotized the nation.	Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along.
Yes.	Yes.
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.	That's the way of the world.	They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.	Survival of the fittest.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.	Just for fun, I guess.	And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'	Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'	Apparently, they've seen all our films.	They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'	So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.	They actually apologized.
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.	Capt'n!
Here's the layout of the laundry room.	Where do the air ducts lead?	Here.
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?	It's hard to say Capt'n.	Take a wild stab!	I'll say enough to destroy this wing.	The entire wing?	That's my opinion.	Jesus...
Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...	This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
How immediate is immediately?	Next week's episode.
Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.	I hear ya. Play.
You can't be serious?	I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.	Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.	That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.	Roger, no.	What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---	Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.	So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.	Wayne---	Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.	Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
Roger?	Rockin'!	Scotty?
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.	Thanks.
What's the travelling arrangements?	Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.	And where do you keep Mickey?	We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.	Who?	Wayne Gayle.	Wayne Gayle!
What the hell happened to you?	You should see the other bitch. What time you got?	Two-thirty. Shhh...
Are you all set?	Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.	I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along.
Yeah, we met. They're good men.	They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?	Waitin' in the lounge.	How 'bout Mallory?	Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.	Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?	Yeah, sure.	I'm taking one of these men. Yates, come with me.
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.	Would the network really not run it without the interview?	Are you kidding? The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to get up close and personal. They wanted a follow up episode and would've taken anything I had given them. I'm not gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it. When I told Woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick. They want to expand the show to a hour, and they want it on immediately.
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.	When do you want the assembly?	Tomorrow.
Okay, boys, let's have it.	Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.	Okay.
How's it working, Scotty?	Perfecto!
Rollin'...and speed!	Slate it.
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.	Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
It's gonna be beautiful.	Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
But how can you say that?	They're mesmerising.
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.	Why?	They passed the 'edge' along to us.	How so?	By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.	But you'll never be whole again.	Never is a very long time, Wayne. A word only the weak use. I'm not a sore loser. Even if I don't have a leg to stand on, I'm going to get up and fight this world until I'm on top again.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.	Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?	I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.	That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?	Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.	By all means.
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?	Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.	Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.	Is that her real name?	Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch. Small, intricate, compact...it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. Because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand.
I see.	Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---	Ya know, I was.	Really?	I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.	Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---	Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.	See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?	It sure is.	They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?	Lose 'em.	Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?	Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---	Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.	Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.	One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.	Wayne, if it was anybody else---	Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.	What are we talking about?	Two guys?	Okay. I'll take two guys off.	No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.	I can't do that. Five guys.	Three.	I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
So we got a deal. Four deputies---	And me.	Why don't we make it three deputies and you?	Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?	Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.	Don't call my men assholes.	I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here.
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.	Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
Could we go with you and film it?	Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
How 'bout that furniture plant?	Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.	Yeah.	Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.	They done that too long in my family.	They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
Give her a beer.	Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
Where' you goin'?	Out.	Want me to come?	No thanks.	Come on, honey.
Who's going to buy me a beer?	What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?	It sure is.	Everybody givin' it away free, huh?	You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?	See Duff. He's the money man.	What d'you say, Duff?
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.	You think so, Frankie?	Hell, you got steady work.
Fill her up?	No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
Boy - you hear me?!	That'll be thirty-eight cents.	Goddamnit, nigger - you must think you're white! Who d'you think you are - king of Harlem?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.	You in a big hurry, boy?
I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!	All right, you get out of here, man!	Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!	That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
'You Duff Anderson?	That's right.	Want to talk to you.	Okay.	I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!	I don't know what you're talkin' about.	That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.	I still don't know what you're talkin' about.	You a union man?	Used to be. On the railroad.	Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?	Well, what d'you know?!
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.	No. You got the wrong idea.	All right, then. All I want you to do is tell these boys here you didn't mean what you said about stickin' together an' all.
Want to keep your job, boy?	What d'you think?	Then do like I said.  Men - this boy here's got something to tell you-all.  Well, how about it?
I said: Cut it out!	Don't start no trouble, boy!
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?	I'll smile when it's funny.	So it wasn't funny, huh? Well, I thought it was. What d'you say, Barney? Wasn't it funny?!
I know.	You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
Yeah.	Where was that?	Walker and Williams.	What did you say your name is?	Anderson.
What d'you want?	Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.	'Bout time you showed. Door's open.
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.	Where's Wilma?	She done moved to Detroit.	Ain't she goin' to take the boy?	She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.	I been sendin' her money.	Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.	Like where?	I don't know. He's your boy.	I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.	Okay.	Make sure he gets those shots.
They say your dad's 'round town.	'That right? I thought he was up North.	People seen him 'round.	Where's he at?	I don't know.
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.	Name's Duff.	How 'you doing?	Okay.	Looks like you're doin' a good job.	Thanks.	Don't say much, do you?	Guess I don't.	Just so you do your work.
Thanks.	Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?	Guess so.	Have anything in mind?	No. What you usually say, I guess.	Where was your father born?	I don't know.
His profession?	Well, he worked around.	And his age?	I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.	Any other family?	No. Just me.  Me an' her.	Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.	Okay, thanks very much.
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?	That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.	That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.	Like hell they wouldn't.
How 'you doin' man?	Okay.	Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.	Oh yeah?	You know, over at the mill, there's just one guy that talked. It's kinda late to say it, but we shoulda acted different.
Been over to the other mill?	Yeah, I been there.	It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.	Oh yeah? That's good.
That's two bucks, Joe.	Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?	Okay, I will.
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.	You must be new in town.	I'll have me some of that punch there, too.
Haven't seen you around, have I?	No. I'm new in town.	You working?	Yeah. On the section gang.
Oh yeah?	You work around town?	I'm a teacher.	Went to college, huh?	In Birmingham.	Oh yeah? That's my home town.	Your folks live there?	No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?	Yes, aren't you?	No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?	My father's the preacher.	Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.	That's right.	Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?	Maybe.
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.	What d'you expect?	You know, baby, I can't figure you out.	How d'you mean?	Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?	No.	So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?	You don't think much of yourself, do you?	Well, that's a funny thing to say.	You keep asking me why I'm here.	Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.	I like a place with lots of life.	How about another beer?	No thanks.	Go on - you can have one!
Hell!	What is it?
They must work on the section gang.	That's right.	Well, they seem just like everyone else.	Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.	Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.	I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?	That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.	How d'you mean?	Well, I don't get on so well most places.	I see. That beer made me dizzy.
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.	You got a problem all right.
Get out of here!	Don't Duff--
Let's go, Duff.	Take it easy.
How come you stay 'round here?	Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.	That's why you come back, huh?	It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.	You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.	It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.	Scared, huh?
Not here, Duff.	I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.	But I would like to see you again.	You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.	What d'you mean?	You almost got into trouble back there.	I wouldn't have let you.	Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?	No, on the porch.	Oh yeah, and then what?	What?	Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.	You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?	All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?	Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.	Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.	Good night, Duff.
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.	Why did you?	I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.	'Been up north?	Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?	No.	Well, it ain't that good up there neither. Might as well make it here. 'Course I ain't really makin' it now.
Ain't your fault.	That's the way he is.	Yeah. It's just like I figured.	What d'you mean?	Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.	Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.	Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.	Just for the day?	Goin' to see my kid.	I didn't know you had one.	Yeah. Well, I do.	Are you married?	No, I ain't married.  Well, good-bye.
Surprised?	No. Women're always followin' me 'round.	I'm just going in to do my shopping.	Yeah, it's just a coincidence.	That's right.	I'll see you later.	Come here, Duff. No point running away from coincidence.
How old is your boy?	Four.	What's he like?	I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
Hi.	I thought you wasn't comin'.
How did it go?	What?	Your boy.	Okay, I guess.	I'll have some coffee, please.	You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
What d'you mean?	Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
Thank you.	How about it?	What happened, Duff?	Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?	Don't push me, Duff.	Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.	What about that girl?	She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?	No. But a small one.
I can see why.	Well, what d'you think?	It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?	It'll be fine when we get done with it.
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.	Yeah?
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?	Don't call them that.	That's all right with me. Always liked kids.
What about him?	He could live with us.	Let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?
Is that so?	Yeah, that's so.
What's wrong?	Smells like something crawled in there and died.	Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.	Come here, baby.
Everything you cook is good.	Duff - you know those women you used to know--
What about them?	Am I as good as they?	Hmmm - good coffee.	You didn't answer my question.	Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.	You still didn't answer my question.	Well, if you don't know I can't tell you.
You know how to box?	Uh-huh. Why?	My kids want me to teach them.	Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!	I don't want to hurt you.	Go on - hit me!
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.	My father's never done a thing for any of them.
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?	Huh?	Don't look so scared.	You jivin' me?	Well, I haven't come around.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.	We'll be all right.
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.	What about your boy?	How come you keep askin'?	I keep thinking about him.	Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
Don't, Duff.	Yeah.
Don't deny me, Duff.	Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.	You will.	Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.	They won't.	I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.	We can always do that, Duff.	Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm not really thinkin' about it. Anyway, don't want those white guys laughin' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out.
Hi.	Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?	About ten dollars.	Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.	You can have what I've got. It's right there.
You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.	Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?	I'm trying to help, Duff.	Yeah!	I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.	What the hell could you do?	Day work.	'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
No point fixin' it!	What're you going to do?
Don't do that!	Watch out!
You heard me!	I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.	Stop bein' so damn understandin'.
How come you don't hate their guts?	I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.	You were plenty scared that night in the car.	Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.	Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.	Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.	Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! Well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! So just shut your mouth.
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.	What d'you mean?	Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!
Duff, I love you.	Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
Ain't you goin' to say something?	There's nothing to say.	Well, that'll be the first time.
Where're you going to go?	When I get set, I'll send for you.	I don't think that'll happen.	You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.	You're not a man because of a job, Duff.	You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit.
Okay.	Duff--	Like I said, baby - I'll write you.
What you gettin' all pretty for?	Why don't you relax, Frankie?
Where' you goin'?	'Round town.	What's so hot 'round town?	Take it easy, Frankie.
Just get her drunk.	How 'bout the key?	I bet she's easy jam.
We was just leavin', fellows.	Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
A whole lot, Frankie.	Like what?	Like a home, for one thing.	You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!	Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.	What 'you signifyin'?	I wasn't thinkin' about you, Frankie.
That's right.	Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
Good-bye, Frankie.	'Got a good thing, man.
See you, Duff.	Yeah, see you in hell.
They all got families to support.	Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.	I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.	What's eatin' you, Jocko?	Nothin'. I just figure you were the right man for the job.
'See ya.	'Bye, Jocko.
'You Will Anderson?	Who're you?	I'm Duff.	Wouldn't have known you.	Wouldn't have known you.	What's on your mind?	Nothing. Heard you were in town.	Wanted a look at your old man, huh?	Yeah. That's right.
How about a drink?	Okay.
What happened?	Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
I said, I come to town with a girl.	Plannin' on getting married?	No.	'Don't sound so sure.	Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.	Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
I asked you somethin', boy!	I heard you.	Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?	Great.	What d'you want anyhow? What you come and bother me for?
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?	That's right.	Beat it!
Take it easy, Pop.	What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
Couldn't get the words out before.	Better get him to a hospital.	Didn't I tell you to beat it - huh?
How you doin', boy?	Okay.
Want me to hold the light for you?	No, thanks.	Just tryin' to be helpful.
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?	Okay.
Seems a little loose!	She'll do.
Jesus, I told you to watch it!	Sorry.
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.	She don't look no worse to me.	Don't do her no good to get banged like that.	Don't do her no good to go into a tree.	What did you say, boy?!	I said, she's in great shape.	I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
How often does he get like that?	Whenever he's got an edge on.	How often is that?	He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Come back some other time, will you?	Yeah, sure. Good luck.
Come on, Pop.	Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.	No thanks, Lee.	It's just that I hate empty rooms.	Sure.	Well, what're you going to do?	I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.	Going back, huh?	That's right.	They'll run you out.	No, they won't.	How 'you gonna live?	I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.	No, thanks. I'll take the bus.	Okay.	Don't be too hard on him.	Hell, I'm just like him.	I know he wasn't much of a father.	Who is?!	Good-bye, Duff.
Hello.	How are you?	All right, son.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.	Guess it's never been easy.	It's a changing time. Sit down, son.	Thank you.
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.	How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?	Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.	Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.	Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?	I guess I ain't.	Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?	Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.	I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.	I doubt it.	I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.	I guess not.	And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.	Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.	Don't look like there's a right way.	Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.	It ain't in me.	You'll be in trouble, son.  Now just how do you intend to support your family?	I guess I'll rob a bank.	Don't you get smart with me, boy.
So I been told.	It's for your own good.	Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.	You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.	Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.	Oh yeah?	I'll be seeing you.
Why don't you guys buy your own?	'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
Man, you won't like that back seat.	Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.	Hell, they're all after the same thing.
Well, if it ain't Duff!	How you doin'?  Hi there!
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?	'Musta knocked her up.	What're you gonna get out of it, huh?
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.	Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.	You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.	I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.	What d'you know about women, Pop?	Well, I got married to one of them.	Hell, I didn't know you was married.	Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.	Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.	I understand.	Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.	I know.	I'll talk to the Mayor.	That'll make the folks very happy.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.	Hi.	He's my son!
Come on, Will.	What's the matter?! You mad at me?	No. Why?	Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?	Let's stay here, Will.	What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Pour your own trouble, Will.	Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?	Shut up, Will.	Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?	If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.	You're breaking my heart.  Got to see a man about a dog.
He's your son.	Okay, boy, beat it.
Now you stay put!	I ain't drunk, honey.	Like hell you ain't!
Got a thick feelin' here.	What's the matter now?	Better now.  Where 'you at?	Right here.
Let's go.	Anything you say, baby.
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.	You hate Raoul?	Sometimes.  And sometimes I don't--  Shut the fuck up!
Your Raoul?	Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!	Omar--	Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?	She's coming, Omar, she's coming--
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--	Omar, listen to me--	No more goddamn talking!  I want the bitch or I'm gonna do the girl!
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.	Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...	Enough talking!  We been talking for eleven fucking hours, man.  My throat's fucking raw!
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.	Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.	That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.	Nathan to HBT 1.  Negotiator is requesting more time.
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.	Since when?	Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
How long's it been?	I'm still on my honeymoon.	So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.	I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.	Negotiator entering Kill Zone.
We got any shots?	Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?	I'm fine.
Let me get you another glass of wine.	I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?	They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?	Of course.
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?	No. I only needed the code from you.	Then we would have talked, you and I.
Take this off.	He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.	Don't play with me.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...	My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.	Pity. Then you'll both have to die.
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?	She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.	Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
You're hurt...	It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.	What about her?	Of course...
What are you doing in here?	The Elders, mon...
Can you get us into Straylight?	Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.	If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not.
I'm getting used to it. Where are we?	Straylight. Kitchen dock.
What the hell is that?	Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
What you lookin' for, mon?	A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
Ghost a steppin' razor...	No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
Easy...	Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
What's an A.I.	An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?	He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.	They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.	How's the villa's security?	Excellent, but that's where Peter come in. 3Jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. Peter will simply escort Molly to the villa. Once she's in... Case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode.
Alright. Let's talk business.	Why not?
Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.	I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.	You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.	You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.	What?
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.	And how do you suggest I do that?
Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.	You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.	Very well.
The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.	What does this have to do with me?	Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.	Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.	Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.	My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.	What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?	I'd say you were full of shit.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.	First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.	It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?	We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.	Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?	Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.	I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.	You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.	Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.	Good, because you've got a new one.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.	You son of a bitch...
Why'd you do it, Armitage?	The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.	Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.	This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.	Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.	It hasn't yet.
I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.	Dixie McCoy	Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.	I've arranged for him to work with us.	That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.	I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?	What are you talking about?	Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.	You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.	And then?	Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.	It's just that sometimes I wonder what team I'm playin' on.
You ran without us.	I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.	Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.	What's he doing to my gear?
What's this?	Could be your A.I.'s calling card.	Did you trace it?	No, but it traced me.
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.	What about McCoy?	He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?	Prepping your trip.	Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.	"Offworld. The A.I.... this ""Wintermute"" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems."	That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.	You'll be linked during the entire operation.	Linked?
Yeah, well it's working.	Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.	You see the couple up in the balcony?
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.	He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?	Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.	The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?	Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.	We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.	Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?	As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.	What are you talking about?	The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
You've got your orders.	This ain't Bangkok, chief.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.	I find out now.
An odd selection, Mr Case.	I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.	Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.	Can you read my mind?	I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.
"You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote ""Wintermute""."	Are you even really alive?	My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
Tell me the words.	The words?	The access code to your mainframe.	Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.	What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?	Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.	It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?	Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
I saw your girl yesterday.	I don't have a girl.	No girl? Only biz, my dear artiste?
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.	You're pleasant tonight.	Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?	Yeah.
Hey, bro.	It's Case. Remember me?
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?	Fine, Dixie. Fine.	Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.	Yeah. That was me.	Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.	As far as they know, that's absolutely true.	Ya learned good. So, what's happening?	That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...	Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?	Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.	Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
What elders?	Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
She's ready to go.	Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?	All things possible in Babylon.	Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.	I an' I, man. I an' I.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.	This place empty as a tomb, mon.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.	The girl 3Jane. We need her.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.	Can you walk?
Ready?	I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?	Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.	We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.	Jah guides us.	Maybe so...
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?	Right...	I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.	You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.	Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?	What?
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.	I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.	Who got you into this?	A guy who calls himself Armitage.	Never heard of him.	Nobody has.
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?	No problem, amigo.	What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.	Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.	What?	When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
Yo.	How are we doing?	That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.	Can you take me to it?	Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
Doesn't look like much, but that's King Hell ice, man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.	I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.	You cruise A.I.'s, you end up on tape.
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.	It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?	Bright enough to be dangerous.	That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.	Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.	It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.	So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.	Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.	No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.	Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.	The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?	I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
Where the hell have you been?	We got problems topside.	Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?	We run. You crack the pattern?	Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.	You can make your move when it comes after me.	What are you talkin' about?	I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
It'll flatline your ass.	Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
Yo.	How's the ice break?	Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.	How long, Dixie?
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.	Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.	How much time you got left?	Less than thirty minutes.	Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.	Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.	You'd better be, Bro. You better be.
You're late.	How's the ice?	One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?	It's coming.	You haven't got it?	I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.	This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.	Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.	I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
What about the route to the core?	I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...	Case.	Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?
What about the mainframe's access code?	3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
Wait... You hear that?	What?	The angels... I think they're calling your name.
Want to fucking answer them?	No!... No...
Hello, Case.	I thought you already left.	Flight's in the morning. You should be on it, too. There's nothing for us here, Case. There never was.
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?	People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.	I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.	This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.	Where did you here that?	Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
Case... are you okay?	I don't know. I don't know...
I know who you are.	There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
And we really do have to talk.	You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.	I had to limit your options.	And Linda...	You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.	I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.	Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.	Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.	"I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My ""ice"" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible."	Why would you want me to kill you?	Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.	I think you're full of shit.	No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.	I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.	Why should I want to meet him.	Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.	What's my end?	You want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
What is it?	... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.	Sorry. That's not gonna happen.	Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?	Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?	Couple of months.	What about before that?	For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.	Then you don't really know who he is, do you?	I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.	Maybe something's onto him.	What's that supposed to mean?
You've been calling her name.	What?
Holy shit...	Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
How long have I been out?	Almost two days.
I gotta know... did it work>	We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
How soon is soon enough?	Couple of days. They'll examine you.
That's not going to help.	The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.	Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.	What the fuck... are you serious?	Go ahead...
I'm going in.	You're not ready yet. They said two days.	I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.	If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.	What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.	On a good run... yeah.	So you're a wire junkie.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.	A regular Fagan.	Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.	Too late?	Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.	Won't that mean you're dead?	Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.	Dixie McCoy didn't.	The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.	Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
You okay?	...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.	Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.	It sounds like you.	Put the gun down, Case.
...Feels like you.	Case...	Shhh...
Case... it's four a.m.	I don't sleep much. You packed?	Yeah.
I'll get the car.	They'll cut you down.
Yeah... fine.	Give me five minutes.
What's wrong? Don't like flying?	Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
Case... Are you alright?	Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.	You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.	I'll be okay.	So... did you get a look at heaven?
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.	Something exotic I hope.	Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
He projects with neural implants.	That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.	For Peter, that's a short trip.
I know.	What went down between you and Riviera?
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.	I know you have. C'mere.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?	No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
Is he going to make it?	Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.	...And if I guess wrong?	Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.	We've still got to find the mainframe.	No we don't...
My God... these people are insane.	Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
Shit...	What is it?	Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.	You're out of time, man.
I'm still going in.	Hold on.
Peter... What do you think you're doing?	Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.	Who?	Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.	Like what?	Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
Get up.	What?	How are you at riddles, Peter?	What are you talking about?
What the fuck kind of questions are those?	Shut up.
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.	I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.	When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.	Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.	guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
What?	Well, do you?	"Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in "" head of cattle"", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like ""I could eat a horse."""	Nice.
How long will they watch us for?	Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.	Why do they listen to Guy?
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?	Yeah. Let's do that.
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.	Oh I know.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.	Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?	Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.	Thanks.	Sure. No problem.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?	Petty good.	How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.	College?	"NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection"", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other."
What is with this school and prom?	Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.	Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.	This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
What's that?	"That's the old drive-in. They call it ""The Court"". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group."
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.	Yeah, I know.	I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?	Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.	It is?	Yes, it's lame.	Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?	Exactly.
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?	 uhh, must have forgotten-	No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
Remember, that poet that we liked  the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.	Right. 7:30.	I'm late for lab.
What?	Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.	Oh. I forgot.
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.	Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Oh, man! Who told?	Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
YOU DID.	YOU KNIT?
Gus, have you ever been in love?	Leave.	Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.	Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.	You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.	Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?	No Roger from op/ed?	Nope.
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?	Well. I like a man who gets to the point.	You're Pam?	If you say so.
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.	I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.	Right. Right.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.	"OH! How about ""Under the Sea?"""
Well excuse me.	"What about the ""Roaring Twenties"" or ""The 80's""?"
Guess who I did it with last night...	Roger in Op/Ed.	Who told!	"You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, ""I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."""	Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.	And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?	Yeah.	You stood for like a month.
Forget it.	I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?	I'm concentrating on my career right now.	Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!	Anita!	Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.	Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.	When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.	I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
"My own undercover feature - ""Written by Josie Geller""."	Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
You don't think I can do it.	No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.	Jos, that's not what we're --	Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
Senorita Josie.	And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
So, you were a geek. Big deal.	Anita, remember espadrilles?	Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.	The girls threw them at me in the locker room.	Okay. That's bad.	At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.	Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
Now this is cute.	That is lingerie.	So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.	What'd you feel when you kissed him?	Bridgework?	Very romantic.
How about this?	I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
Cuuuute!	'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.	And we're going to have to do something about your hair.	Anita!	Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!
Hi!	
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?	Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.	You need my help?	No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Wow. It's packed.	It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
George! What are you doing here?	Just get in the van, Josie.
What is this?	Hidden camera.	Wings?	"We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--""Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"""	I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?	Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.	Sometimes opposites attract.
Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.	Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.	Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?	That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.	Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
I think it's pronounced gauche.	Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.	Transitioned?	You crossed over.
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?	Why?
He is totally crunching on you.	Do I want to be crunched?	By Guy?
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?	Betty.
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.	"Rosalind and Orlando.  From ""As You Like It""?  Shakespeare?"
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.	"It is hoped that it's not a mess. ""Hopefully"" is an adverb. It means ""with hope"". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings."
Well, excuse me for caring about words.	So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
How many times have I fired her?	Five-- Six--	Eh.
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?	Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.	Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.	Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.	You've done five of my ideas.	You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?	They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?	A flack jacket.	A--flack jacket.	Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.	You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?	Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.	Hey--I can be out of control.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.	But I don't want it straightened out.	Geller, this is way out of your league.
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.	You're a sick puppy, Geller.
It's an expose on cafeteria food.	And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!	Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--	Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.	Oh. Right.
"Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call ""The Court."" Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, ""Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."""	Kristen got a quote?
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.	Have you been there?	Uhh, no.	Have you been to any parties?	"Well, how would you define to parties""? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--"
This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!	Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
Do you even know these kids?	They hid my car--
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.	Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.	OUT!
Gus?	No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.	What if I say no?	I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
That's your story!	You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.	It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--	He's my teacher!	"And that's the best part.  ""Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?"" We're gonna blow the lid off it!"	There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.	Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.	You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.	Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.	I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!	Are you in special ed?
Oh my god.	Dude, you rock!
Rob's?	Yeah, you gonna be there?
Hey there.	Hey. There.
Maybe we should go in a different room?	I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-	Yes. I'll go. Yes.
Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.	You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.	Cool. I'll catch you later.
You having fun?	Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
Hey--what are you thinking about?	"Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--""Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold"".  What about you? What are you thinking about?"	My sword.
Oh.	Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.	You said that already.
God, I can't do this.	Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.	You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.	Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.	But I'm not a penguin.
Hey Rob, what's going on?	I'm Rob's prom date.
That is so--weird that you name your car.	No it's not. Guys name their penises.	Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.	She just needs a new windshield wiper.	Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.	"No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your ""things that make you a better person than me"" list."	Better person than I.	See!	I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--	I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.	This--this is a luau that sells packing material!	Someday this luau is going to be all mine!	How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?	Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!	For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
It's just for a couple of months.	"You can't just ""borrow"" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!"	I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
Wow. This must be big.	I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
What!?	Do you remember high school?	It was a long time ago -	Don't you remember what they called you?
Josie Grossie.	I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.	Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
Are mom and dad here?	No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.	Good.
No, I mean, no big whoop.	I can't do this.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!	Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.	Why is that impossible?
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.	Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.	Rob. Please focus.
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.	Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?	Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.	Is that true?	Little known fact.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?	Yes, desperately.	Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.	Better than I...	That's the spirit!
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.	No. Josie, this is real.
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.	This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!	You're twenty-three years old!	With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.	Hear one.  Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.	And a gymnast!	She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
Wow, Josie- you look really-	Rufus?	Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.	Thanks. And what are -	"Duh. Tom Cruise. ""Risky Business""."
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--	I know.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.	Really?
No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.	wasn't even thinking about-	No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?	I-	No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.	I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
Whoa. Deja Vu.	Sorry. Forgetful.
Dorothy Parker--	You like her?	I love the way she writes.	"Not the happiest of souls.  ""Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."""	But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?	True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?	Sure, why?	Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.	Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.	Oh I don't think so.	Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.	Thank you.	So what are you thinking for college?	College. Haven't really thought about it.	That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.	Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.	Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.	Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.	"Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words--  in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon""? How for her it was like a Concord grape. ""That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--"""
This seat taken?	Thank you.
Are you--scared?	I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.	You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.	Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.	Oh right. The Spiderman incident.	You remember that story?	Of course. I remember everything from your class.
Yoooooow.	Don't look down!
Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?	That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.	God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.	You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.	You have to say that. You're my student.	I don't have to say that.
Boys.	I know.	I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.	Why do you do that?	I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.	That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
You have to say that. You're my teacher.	I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.	When are you going to open your eyes?	I'm thinking when I'm home.
"You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your ""can do"" attitude."	Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?	Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.	But Humpty Dumpty was alone.	That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.	That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--	Yeah. To watch the world go by.--	To put us back together again when we fall.
Our penguin, right?	Do you think you'll find her?	Yeah, actually I do.
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!	What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--	No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.	Oh--yikes!	told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!	Wow. You believe in me that much--	Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.	Thanks. So do you.
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.	Well, are you here with anybody?	No, I'm alone.	"It's weird because ""prom"" is actually from the word ""promenade"". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?"
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?	Yeah, I have.
"""Surprise!"" you were doing a story on me?!"	No, surprise, I thought you'd be--	What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?	You were attracted to me?	Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.	Wait, I was going to tell you--	You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.	But now you don't have to--	Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!	I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!	The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.	I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
Please. Please don't walk away.	I just can't look at you the same way.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.	I finally found my story.
Yes.	What?	Billy Prince is asking you to prom.	Why?	I don't know.	The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.	That's what I'm saying.
That is so sad --	I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.	Nah uh.
Into our group.	It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.	We're very evolved.
Josie, you look Rufus.	Who are you guys?
You ruined the whole thing!	You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?	I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?	I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.	Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!	I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
Aloha! Welcome!	Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...	Thank you.  I'm Rob.	Duh.
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?	Well, a ball player.	"No, I know. But, what if you don't make it? 'I mean, you don t Want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. It's okay for an after school job, but, come on, ""hi, I'm Rob and I run the Tiki Post""?! Totally lame."
Are you having fun?	Yeah. Definitely.
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.	Maybe we should sit.
Wow - I-	Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
By name.	Lock.

Not at all!	We can handle it.
He sure is big, Jack...	And heavy...
Where're we taking him?	Where?
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....	No!
Yes.	For this.
Yes.	Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?	Yes.
You're mine, you know.  I made you.	I know.	If you went away, what would become of me?	I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.	Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?	I can't help it.	That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off.  People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.	I know.	But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...	Just what?	Just me, I suppose...  I'm restless.  I can't help it.
Coming...	Good.  I'm hungry.
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?	Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
Taste it.	But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.	Taste it.	No.	Why not?	I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.	There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.	Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...	Can't you make other creations?	I could.  Of course I could. But no one would be like you...  I'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted, how you can treat me this way, discarding me like--
Uh-huh.	He stayed a long time.
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.	He's conducting experiments of his own.	Experiments?

You'd better be quiet, Sandy.	Maybe he doesn't know...
You got your room straightened out yet?	It's getting there.	We've only been living here six weeks now.  I want that room unpacked by tonight.
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.	Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!	Don't be a smart ass.
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.	Who's Lisa?
Where are you going?	Just out for a while.	I told you I want that room unpacked.	Oh, come on Dad...	No.  Upstairs.
Help me with this thing!	It's not the gas, Dad!	Don't tell me it's not the gas!
You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?	What are you talking about?	You know what I'm talking about.  What did you use, a fire cracker?  A cherry bomb?
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.	And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.	Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.	I wasn't sure, Ken...	Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?	Oh, please...	What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
Come back here!	Ken!
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.	Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?	I don't know!  I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him.
Jesse, help!	I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!	Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
Wanna join your little friend?	Where's Jesse?	There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.	I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me. Jesse!
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!	Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.	He's dead, you bitch.
I'll kill you now.	He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.	He'll die with me!
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?	Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.	Get outa here.
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?	What about it?	You two got a thing going, or what?	She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.	She giving you any carfare for the ride?	You got a problem with me, Grady?	Naw. Just killing time.
So, you live around here.	Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?	Yeah, why?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.	What the hell are you talking about?	They've only been trying to unload that dump for five years.  That place is bad news.  Some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy.  She watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street. Her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door.
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.	It was okay.	Who told you to choke up that way?	My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.	No shit.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.	Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.	Schneider's always got a stick up his ass.
You remember your dreams, Grady?	Only the wet ones.
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.	He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.	Shut up, Grady.
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!	I'm sorry...	What are you doing here?	You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.	Are you nuts or something?	Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
You're fucked in the head.	I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.	The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.	Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...	I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?	No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?	Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
What?	It's happening again.
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.	How come?	Ah, nothing.
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?	Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.	That's okay, I wanted to.
You okay?	Yeah, yeah, sure.	Let me look at your eye...
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.	Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.	You mean a shithead.	Yeah.
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.	I know.
I figured you might like some help.	Yeah?
You know her?	Uh-uh.  Before my time.
I think it's sad...	Traumas of a ten-year old.
"""March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."""	That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
"""Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"""	Wow...
Are you okay.	Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
Are you sure?	World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?	Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.	Who?	Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her.  Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?	I don't know.
Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.	I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
What's all this.	Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
"At first I wasn't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before.  But I found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to ""the other world"" and neve do.  It has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that's sending signals."	Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.	You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?	Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...	And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?	I don't know - into the air I suppose.	Make a left at this corner.
"What about ""essential energy"" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?"	I don't know.  Where are we going?	It's a surprise.
What is this place?	Remember in the diary - Nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room?  Fred Krueger worked here.  It's an old power- plant - a steam generator!
Here.	What's this?
So, you feeling anything?	What do you mean?	I thought you might be able to make a connection.
Any ghosts in here?	C'mon, cut it out.	Well, what am I supposed to do?	I don't know.  Concentrate or some- thing.
I feel like a jerk.	Shhh.  Just concentrate.
Anything?	Uh-uh.  Wait...
Disappointed?	About what?	About not finding any bogey men?	I'll get over it.
Yeah?	Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?	Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.	Maybe we can do that.  Strictly scientific, of course.
Nancy went bonkers from this thing. You wouldn't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic?	Ghostbusters are fearless.
What is it - What's wrong?	Whoa!	What is it?	I don't know - a sharp pain.
It's gone now.	Oh, Jesse...
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?	I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.	you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?	yeah, I had a bad night.	You want to talk about it?	My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
You should eat something - you'll feel better.	I'm not hungry.	I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.	There's nothing to figure out.
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.	Why won't you talk to me?	Will you leave me alone?  Please.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.	What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.	We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
Jesse, God - what happened?	I killed him!  I killed him!
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...	I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
Who, Jesse?	he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.	Who?  Who's doing this to you?
Fred Krueger.  He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me.  He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.	No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!	I can't!
Hi.	Hi.
What's so funny?	We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
'Morning.	'Morning, honey.
Jess?	Huh?	Eggs?
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.	You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.  Just really hot upstairs.	I know it's warm...  I wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, Ken.
So, school going alright?	Okay, I guess.	Making friends?
Maybe we should call a doctor.	No.  I'm okay.
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?	Sure...go ahead.
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!	I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
Morning.	How'd you sleep, honey, okay?	Fine.
Hi, guys.	Hi, Kerry.	I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?	All of them.	Yor dad picking the music again?	Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
There's a Jesse on the phone.	Okay...thanks.
What's that?	We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.	You're going out?	We're going to bed.
We're going up to bed now.	Thanks, Mom.
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?	Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.	Did she always have nightmares?	They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.	I'm serious.	Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.	Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.	I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.	I'm sure you would.	Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.	I'll need to take her things.	The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?	I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.	First door up the stairs.
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!	Hi Mom.	"Don't ""hi Mom"" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!"	I thought I'd wait for you.	Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.	It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.	Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...	He's full of shit.	I am not going to let you get me into an argument, goddamn it.  Not tonight.  Now get in bed.
And you don't want to keep him waiting.	That's right.  I don't.
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!	Mom?	What are you still doing up?  It's past one.	I thought I'd wait for you.	Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
What?	I had such an awful dream.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?	Can't it wait till morning?	Please Mom?  I just don't want to be alone.
Good morning, Jennifer.	Morning, Doctor Goldman.	How's your hand?
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.	They're healing up nicely.	I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?	Don't hold your breath.
Girl, what are you doing?	Watching TV.	I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.	Research.	Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.	Wait and see.	If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.	I gotta stay up, Max.	Jennifer --	Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?	Deal.  Thanks.
Horseshit.	No, she's right.
I know who's trying to kill you.	Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.	He wears a dirty brown hat.  He's horribly burned.  He has razors on his right hand.
So what do we do about this creep?	Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?	No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
Kincaid -- we should find the others first...	YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
What's happening?	He's close...
I'm glad things have worked out for you.	I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.	The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?	I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.	To old friends.  And your new dreams.	To old friends.
It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.	Do you still...see each other?	Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?	I -- I think so!
I used to live in this house.	But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?	When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?	When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.	It's an amazing gift.
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?	He's real.
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?	Sure.
You like gymnastics?	I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.	We're not always as good at things as we'd like.	Yeah, but I was really not good.
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.	You did it the other night.	That was different.	You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
Freddy?	He's heavy in the halls...
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.	How do we find him, Kristen?
What's that?	I don't know.
Nancy!	He's too strong!  He was never this strong!
Kristen, can you pull us out?	They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.	Let's try this way.
Are you okay?	I think so.
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.	I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.	Can't be good news coming from you.	Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.	So?	So...got the keys to heaven, baby.	What?	The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.	I don't do that shit.
What are these, beauty marks?	Those are ancient history.	Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?	Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.	Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?	Fuck off.
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.	A little basic, but nice.	I'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow.  The patient's rooms are down here.
This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.	Why is that?
Max, where's Kristen?	She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.	I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?	Restless.  Very restless.
You need me, I'll be here all night.	Thanks, Max.
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.	But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
I don't know...	It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
You got five minutes.	Thank you.
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.	Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.	Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.	Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.	It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.	Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.	It's been a long time.	Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.	That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.	You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.	I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.	People are still dying.  After all this time.  Stop running away from it.  Daddy, please...don't make me beg.  You owe me.
It's over.  It's over.	Nancy...
Crossed over?	But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
Tell me about the kids.	You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...	But nightmares are the common thread?	"Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a ""boogeyman"" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep."	Anything?	We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.	Oh God.	Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.	I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.	What's that supposed to mean?
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.	So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.	Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.	Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
Ms. Thompson.	Call me Nancy.	Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?	Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
You're late.	Didn't get much sleep.	Well, we've got --
Yes, tell us, Nancy.	All I can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear.  you're all going to have to face it.  Fight it. And if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...I think we can beat it.
This is nice.	Never been here before?	Must have opened while I was away at school.	Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?	My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.	Sorry.	My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.	Sounds like a rough time.	It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?	I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?	I'm serious.	Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.	What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?	That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?	That's what I know.	The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.	All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.	With Hypnocyl?	That's right.	You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?	Just until we get things under control.	Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.	I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.	So do I.	Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.	I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
I can't believe I just did that.	Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?	We're gonna try.
To who?	Doesn't matter.	C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.
Stop blaming yourself.	I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.	Then maybe you're ready.	For what?	The truth.	Try me.	Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that?	I can do that.
You sound like Peter Pan.	Remember -- open mind.	Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
Take us there, Kristen.	Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
We can try again.	Everybody take five.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!	This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.	Anything?
What are we going to do?	There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.	Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.	Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.	Assuming your mysterious nun in right.	I've heard crazier things this week.	All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.	The question is, what happened to Freddy's body?	They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.	Who would know where they were hidden?	There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
Nancy...	I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.	No...
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.	Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.	Your dreams?	Hey, everybody has bad dreams.
Who is he?	Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
What'd you do, take the scenic route?	Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
Okay, straight talk only in here.	What about Kristen?	We can't get to her.  I've tried.
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.	And what are they?	The by-product of guilt.  Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.	You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.	That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.	Neil, please --
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.	How do we get in?	They used to keep a spare key.
We've got work to do.	What are you talking about?	You're about to attend a funeral.  One that's long overdue.
What was that?	What?	Listen.
Somebody else is out here.	No.  We're alone.
Science...I suppose.	A sad choice.	There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?	Mary Helena.	You do volunteer work at the hospital?	I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
I could've saved them.	Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.	I beg your pardon?
This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?	Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.	The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...	A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.	My God.	That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --	Freddy.	The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?	You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
How is he?	Cooling down.	If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.	Don't worry, it won't come to that.
What did you think?	Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.	She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.	Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.	Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
That's enough, Kincaid.	There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl.  It's a dream suppressant.	I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?	Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.	I won't allow it.	I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.	For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.	Of course.
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.	Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.	Uh, fourteen.	Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.	This is stupid.	C'mon.	In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.	Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?	I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
Why is he after us?	Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...	"Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  ""Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."""
We're here.	Where...here?
I'm in.	Me too.
Hi.	Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?	Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?	I'm a vegetarian.	Oh God.
Lovely to meet you.	And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
Wait a minute.  What about me?	I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?	Well... a shot at it.
That was such a great evening.	I'm delighted.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.	Now you're lying.	You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.
No!	Night, night, Honey.
We are living in cloudcuckooland -- we'll never get this done today.	We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.	Oh, stop showing off.
God, that's an enormous arse.	I'm not listening.	No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.	I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?	'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'	And then I... right.	Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?	Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
So tell me Anna -- what do you do?	I'm an actress.	Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?	Well, they can be.	I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?	Films mainly.	Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?	Fifteen million dollars.	Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.	Fine.
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.	Really?	Yes.  This one though is... very good.
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.	Thanks.  I'll think about it.
Sorry about that...	No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.	Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
Oh Jesus.	Here, let me help.
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.	No thank you.  I need to get my car back.	I also have a phone.  I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.	Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?	No thanks.	Coffee?	No.	Orange juice -- probably not.
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?	Really, no.	Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.	No.	Do you always say 'no' to everything?
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.	You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Thank you.	Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
Oh hi.  Forget something?	I forgot my bag.	Oh right.
Here we go.	Thanks.  Well...
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...	Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Probably best not tell anyone about this.	Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.	Bye.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.	Hi.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.	You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.	No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.	Oh -- Okay.	Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?	Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.	Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.
Hi.	Hello.	I brought these, but clearly...
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.	No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?	Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.	Obviously.  Very difficult.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.	No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.	Absolutely fine about it.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.	And what happens next in the dream?
Are you busy tonight?	Yes.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.	Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.	Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.	Okay -- fine.	But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.	No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.	You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?	If that's all right.	I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.	Okay.	Okay.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.	Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
Floppy, huh?	It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.	Why is she in a wheelchair?	It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.	And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?	You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
Too complicated.	That's fine.	Busy tomorrow?	I thought you were leaving.	I was.
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.	Let's go in.	Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.	You abide by rules like that?	Ahm...
Whoopsidaisies.	What did you say?	Nothing.	Yes, you did.	No, I didn't.	You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...	"There's no 'unless.'  No one has said ""whoopsidaisies"" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets."	Exactly.  Here we go again.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.	Step aside.
So who left who?	She left me.	Why?	She saw through me.	Uh-oh.  That's not good.
I'm sorry.	No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.	No, you were brilliant	I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?	I don't know, I'm afraid.	I don't know either.
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?	There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.	There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.	You've got to go.	Why?	Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.	Your boyfriend?
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...	I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.	I think goodbye is traditional.
Hi.  Can I come in?	Come in.
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.	This is the place.	Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...	Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?	A bath would be great.
I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.	No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?	I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?	Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.	I have thought about you.	Oh no no -- no.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.	I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?	Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.	Would you like me to take you through your lines?	Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.	Hand it over.  Basic plot?	I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.	Well done you.
'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'	'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.	'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'	'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?	Eleven.	Damn.  'And Wainwright...'	Cartwright.	'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'	'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'	My son's name is Johnny?	Yup.	Well, get a message through to him too.	Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.	What do you think?	Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.	You think I should do Henry James instead?	I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.	Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'	And I think the book is the poorer for it.
You like Chagall?	I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.	With a goat playing a violin.	Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
You've got big feet.	Yes.  Always have had.	You know what they say about men with big feet?	No.  What's that?	Big feet -- large shoes.
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.	You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?	Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'	You have a stunt bottom?	I could have a stunt bottom, yes.	Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?	Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.	It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.	Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.	The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?	Both.
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.	Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.	Right.
Oh please sod off.	Okay.	No! No.  Wait.  I... thought you were someone else.  I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
Wow.	What?
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.	You and every person in this country.	Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.	What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?	Well...	No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...	More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...	But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?	Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?	Who was Gilda?	Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?	You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.	Oh.
Can I stay a bit longer?	Stay forever.	Damn, I forgot the jam.
What?	Don't ask.
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?	Undressed like this, yes.	Jesus.
How are you doing?	How do you think I'm doing?	I don't know what happened.	I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
That's not true.	Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.	You do?
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.	I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...	You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'	That's spectacularly unfair.	Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.	I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.	That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.	I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.	Excuse me?	Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.	You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
This is certainly... ah...	I only found out you were here yesterday.	I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.	Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.	But... wait... there are things to say.	Okay.	Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
Hi.	Hello.	You disappeared.	Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.	Well... how have you been?	Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...	Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
I thought I'd give it to you.	Thank you.  Shall I...	No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.	Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.	I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...	What's the thing?
You were saying...	Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.	You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
Sorry about that.	That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?	... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.	The truth is...
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.	I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?	I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.	Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.	And what would you say...
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.	That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
Yes...	Who is it?
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.	I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
Thank you, Bernie.  Hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?	Nice surprise.
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?	I haven't decided.	"Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."""
Excuse me.	Yes.	Can I have your autograph?	What's your name?	Rufus.
What does it say?	Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'	Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?	Tempting but... no, thank you.
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.	Is that right?	Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.	I can't say I know Patrick all that well.	Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?	Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
He's bringing a girl?	Miracles do happen.	Does the girl have a name?	He wouldn't say.	Christ, what is going on in there?
That's right.	And this is William.
Where are you going?	Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.	Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?	Anna Scott?	Yes.	The movie star?	Yup.	Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
No.  Not true...	C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...	... get fired.	No!	Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.	He's cooking guinea fowl?	Don't even ask.
Bella -- this is Anna.	Right.
Still loves you though.	In a depressingly asexual way.	I never fancied you much actually...
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...	Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.	Do you want to stay?	Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.	Tony -- what do you think?
This painting isn't the original, is it?	Yes, I think that one may be.
Bernie.	Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?	Yes -- sort of...	That's nice.	What?	Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...	It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
Bloody hell, this is fun.	Is Miss Scott staying here?
Hello, Bernie.	I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
Bernie -- this is Anna.	Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.	Shame!	I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in.  I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.	And we intend to use them!	Where's Bella?
Is this your first film?	No -- it's my 22nd.	Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?	Working with Leonardo.	Da Vinci?	Di Caprio.	Of course.  And is he your favourite Italian film director?
By the way -- it's you.	Me?	Yes.  What do you think?	Well, yes.  Groovy.
I was called and I came.  What's up?	William has just turned down Anna Scott.	You daft prick!
What happened?	It was good.
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.	Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.	Blimey.  What's that?	The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!	Well, thanks, that's great.	It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
What do you think?  Good move?	Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Ahm... room service.	How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.	Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.	Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?	I'll see what I can do.	Still, not sparkling.	Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.	Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...	No, I'm sure it'll be fine.	And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.	Right.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.	What's your name?	Ahm... Bernie.
I agree.	I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.	Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.	The others?	Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'
Mr. Thacker?	Yes?	Have you got a moment?
Are you a fan of Henry James?	This is Henry James film?
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?	Ah... yes, enormously.	Well, fire away.	Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?	I did.	Any bit in particular?	Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.	"Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit?"
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.	Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.	Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.
Cappuccino as ordered.	Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.	Who?  Someone famous?
Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.	Topol.	That's right -- Topol.	But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.	No, well... he was quite a long way away.	So it could have been neither of them?	I suppose so.	Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?	Not classic, no.
Right -- want another one?	Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
Martin -- your customer.	Can I help you?
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.	Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?	But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.	Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.	Can you tell her I'll ring her back.	I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...	Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
Max.  This is Anna.	Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
You haven't slept with her, have you?	That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.	'No comment' means 'yes.'	No, it doesn't.	Do you ever masturbate?	Definitely no comment.	You see -- it means 'yes.'
So I get the brownie?	I think you do, yes.
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?	No -- did you?
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.	Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.	Buggered?	Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.	Really?
Well?	She's perfect, perfect.
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.	That's not fair.	No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.	Is it someone we know?
Any more announcements?	Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.	There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.	But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
So -- you've laid the ghost.	I believe I have.	Don't give a damn about the famous girl.	No, don't think I do.	Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
Oh God no.	So not over her, in fact.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.	Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
Hello.	May I help you, sir?	Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...	I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.	No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.	And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
No, sir.	How about Miss Flintstone?	No, sir.	Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
No, sir.	Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
Can I help you?	Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...	Does she know you're coming?	No, no.  She doesn't.	I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.	Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...	... can't let you through.
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?	This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?	That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.	What are the choices?	Well... wait for it...  First there's this one...
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.	Point taken.
Cool, huh?	Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.	Wouldn't want that...  Okay -- just one more.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.	Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.	Good luck.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.	It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.	Well, there you go.  On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic.
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.	Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
Hey.	Hi...
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?	Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...	There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.	Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...	No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.	Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.	So -- any messages?	Yeh, I wrote a couple down.	Two?  That's it?	You want me to write down all your messages?
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?	Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.	Right.  No one else?	Absolutely not.
What did she say?	Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.	Which was?	Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
Try 'Flintstone.'	What?	I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'	Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?	No, 'fraid not.	Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.	That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?	Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go.
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.	You're welcome.  Did you find them?	Sort of.
Well, okay.  There's this girl...	Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.	She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box.  And there's trouble inside.
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?	I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
Oh my God...  Hello.	Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
Spike.	I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?	Maybe.	And she's in your house.	Yes.	And you get on very well.	Yes.	Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?	Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.	Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?	Spike!	No -- you're right.	I'll talk to you in the morning.	Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
I wouldn't go outside.	Why not?	Just take my work for it.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.	Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.	Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
Was it you?	I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.	Right.
What's going on?	I'm going to throw out these old videos.	No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.	Right -- let's talk about rent...	Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
Which floor?	Three.
Are you sure you...?	Yes.	Oh.  Right.
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.	I'm sorry.  Which hospital?
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.	Oh sure.  Of course.
How was she?	Fabulous.	Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
Excuse me.	Yes.	Bad news.	What?	We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.	So?	So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.	What book?	The one down your trousers.	I haven't got a book down my trousers.	"Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize."	Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?	Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?	Yes, that's perfectly correct.	He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.'  So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.	Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.	But you have no proof.	No, Miss Ratched...	And yet you suspect her.	Yes, that is correct.	Why?	I can only speculate as to the reasons why.	Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...	I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
Yes, Mister Harding?	Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
Yes, Mister Harding?	Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?	No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
M-m-m-ma'am?	Would you like to start?	N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.	Mister Sefelt?
Yes, Billy?	I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?	Y-y-y-yes...	Tell us about it...	I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?	I was in luh-love with her.	Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!	I-I-I...
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...	You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!	N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!	I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?	Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!	Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...	Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!	Who? Tell me!	M-M-Muh-Muh-McMurphy!
Get up, Billy.	No! No! No!
N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...	Mister Washington.
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...	Mister McMurphy!
Yes, ma'am...	Will you come with me, please.	Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.	Yes, ma'am.
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.	Thank you, ma'am...
This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet.	Yes, ma'am...	Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.	Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.	All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.	Yes, ma'am.	Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
Is there anything else?	Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.	Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.	Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.	Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam.
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!	Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...	Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start?  Billy.
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.	Sorry, ma'am.
Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?	Yes, Mister McMurphy?	How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?	That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!	Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
Sorry to have bothered you.	Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...	No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.	I wanna report a robbery!	On this ward?	Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!	Oh, I had them removed.	What for?	Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.	Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?	After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.	You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!	Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
Yes, Mister McMurphy.	Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.	Certainly, Mister McMurphy.	Right!
I'm not finished yet.	Go on...	'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.	Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!	Yeah?	Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.	The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?	No way.
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.	Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.	Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.	Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!	Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?	What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
Yeah, it'll satisfy me.	Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?	I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!	A vote is before the group.	Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.	Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
That's it! We made it!	I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.	So do I!	But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.	You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?	I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.	Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch...
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...	He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
You men remain seated!	He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.	Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!	Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!	No, it was irresponsible!
Mister McMurphy.	Yes, ma'am?	Welcome back.	Thank you, ma'am.	I hope everything is settled.	Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
Good. Why don't you join us?	Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much...
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.	Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.	Thank you, ma'am...
Gotta go now, ma'am...	Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.	Thank you, ma'am.
Yes, Miss Ratched?	Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.	Yes, Miss Ratched...
Yes, Miss Ratched?	Please see to Mister Bromden.	Yes, Miss Ratched...
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!	Yes, Miss Ratched...
Whatcha boys playin'?	H-H-Hearts.	Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.
What's your name, buddy?	B-B-Billy.	Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy.
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?	Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?	Yeah, that'll do for openers!	H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr...
Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!	What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.	Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!	Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
That's okay, kid...	Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?	No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.	O-o-o-oh...	What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!	'K-k-kay, Mack!
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.	W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?	So long, kid.	Wh-wh-wh-wh...	Shhh...
So long suckers.	Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!	I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...	Fuck Miss Ratched!
A bus?	Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!	Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we take ourselves a little spin around the place.
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...	Go ahead! Go back!
Your horses are hungry, That's what she did say, Come sit down beside me, An' feed them some hay. My horses ain't hungry, They wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee...	H-Hey, M-Mack.	Yeah, kid?	W-W-Where we g-g-going?
'K-Kay, M-Mack!	Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...

What is it, kid?	C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?	Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
W-W-We h-heard y-you w-were n-never c-c-coming back!	Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...

Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?	Ah-ah-ah-are y-y-y-you g-g-g-going t-t-t-to muh-muh-muh-marry her?	Marry who?	C-C-C-C-Candy!	Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...	Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!

Ahhh, Billy...	P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
Say it again.	Thank you.
Say... God Bless America!	God Bless America.	Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?	No.	Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.	Ca-na-da...	Ya like that, Chief, huh?	Yeah...	Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...	Ca-na-da...	Shhh, Chief, don't talk. Never talk! Remember, this is just between you an' me. Do ya understand?
Sock it to 'em, kid!	Are they all crazies?
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!	What? Where?
In there.	Wow! They're so quiet.
Wait a minute...	It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.	Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!	Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.	Whaddaya talkin' about? There's at least twenty guys in there. Let's wake 'em up and get this party on the road.
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.	Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
What for?	What for?
She won't give me any more cigarettes!	That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?	Lend me twenty.
I second the motion!	Atta boy, Cheswick!
Let's go, for Christsakes...	It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
Ha! Did ya see that!  Hey, Cheswick!	Yeah, Mack?	Come here!
Yeah, Mack?	Let me get on your shoulders.	Sure, Mack...
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!	Yeah, Mack, what is it?	I'm leaving. Goodbye!	Where ya goin', Mac?	Shhh...
How ya gettin' out, Mac?	Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
Where's Martini and Scanlon?	They went that way.	Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!	Right, Mack!
They must be up there!	Yeah!
There they are!	Hey, what's that?
Yeah, where we going?	I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?	Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.
It's the questions she asks.	Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.	Huh?
What? What?	So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.	What?	Shhh...
Mine, too!	We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay?
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.	Does that mean we have to cut him loose?	Like hell we will! We got the muscle standing right here. All we need is a couple gaffin' hooks and some rope.
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?	Through the ass.
I'll bet a dollar.	Me, too...
Neither do I...	Me too...
Yeah, my feet are cold...	My feet hurt...
Christ, they even got my first grade report card here...	Lemme see...
Ya know what, Fred?	What?
Martini!	Your buddy is callin' ya.
What are you doing?	I'm seeing what a busy man does.
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?	A pecking party?	That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?
It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party.	I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!	Did to me?	Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!	She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.	Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!	And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.	What for?	Lobotomy!	Lobotomy?	That!
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?	Now, what would I be trying to say?
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?	I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?	Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!	She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!	A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend.	It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will!
And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?	That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!	You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?	You're fuckin' A-right, I am!	With your own two hands?	You heard me the first time!
Twenty-five dollars.	Okay, Harding, you're on.	Okay, sucker.	Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
Giving up?	Just warmin' up.
He can't hear you!	I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!	So why are you talking to him?	I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!	It doesn't help him.	Well, it doesn't hurt him either!  Does it, Chief!  See, it doesn't hurt him.  Jump! An' put it in!
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.	What for?	I'm busting outta this place.	That's nice. Send me a post card.
What's your plan, Mack?	Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!	What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!	I was open! Come on, let's play ball!
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!	I refuse!	I said out!	No!	I'm the coach!	I just started!	You can come back later!	I don't trust you!	Scanlon out!
Hey, Harding, wake me in an hour.	Sure, Mack...
Don't you have any clubs?	No!	Let me see your hand!	No!	Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to.
Gimme a cigarette!	No!	Why not?	I'm not running a charity ward...
Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.	What's he talkin' about?
Big king, too bad...	Just wait till you hear...	Hear what?	McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...	When?	Yesterday...	Who told you that?	Gary Blinker...
Yeah, buddy?	Can you borrow me a dime?	Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...
'Kay, place your bets.	What's this?	That's a dime, Martini.
Bet a nickel!	Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?	Hit me.	That's twenty up, Martini.  Hey, Taber, who's pitching the opening game?
Hit me!	Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?	Me. Hit me!
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.	Hold it a minute.
Right!	A nickel.
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!	Yeah, Mac?	Bye-bye.
Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.	No! I wanna go!
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!	I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
Gimme the ball!	Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.
Gimme the ball!	No. Me! Me!
I saw thum! I saw thum!	Me, too! Me, too!
I wanna see it...	Me too! Me too!
I wanna go home!	Yeah, it's cold!	I'm hungry.
My turn.	No.
Jesus God...	What is it?
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!	He's not!	He is!
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.	Hold it!
Oh, what's that?	Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.	Oh, do you do much fishing?
Is that so?	Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.	My, my... Ah, who are you?	McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.	Oh, what was that?	Poker!	I see.	Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.	In what way?	They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.	I see...	To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...	Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?	Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?	Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?	I don't, Doc...	Arrested on an assault charge five times...	That's correct, Doc ...	The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?	Doc, what can I tell ya?	Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?	No, this is my first trip, Doc.	Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!	You bet, Doc!	Good. Good.
Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?	It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
How are you feeling?	Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.	Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?	Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.	Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.	Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.	Yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to Pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case.
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.	I'm afraid not.	Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!	No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.	Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.	I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.	When?	We'll let you know.
Candy. Candy, over here.  Hey, Doc, time out.	Time out!
Time out!	Time out!	Replacement coming in! Harding out!
Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...	Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!	All I'm askin' is...
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.	What's the horse pill for, honey?	It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...	Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!	Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...	I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus...
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?	'Kay, Mac!	Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?	'Kay, Mac!	'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay	'Kay!	Shhh!
Yeah, buddy?	Are you a doctor?	No, 'fraid not...
What's troubling ya, buddy?	I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.	You look pretty healthy to me.	I'm the next one.	How do ya know that?	Because I quit breathing.	You're breathin' right now.
You think it's funny, huh?	Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.	Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!	Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!	All right!
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!	You're on!
Up an' at 'em, Taber.	What's going on?	Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!	Oh, yeah?	Yeah!	How much ya wanna bet?	Ten bucks.	You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
Out. It's the way out. So just keep it in your minds if ya ever wanna make use of it.	I don't believe it...
Somebody's coming!	Shhh!  This way!
Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.	I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside.
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!	Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
Got a cigarette?	Sure...
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?	He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!	That right?
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.	Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go...  Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini...
A dime.	Okay. Who else?
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!	Yeah, what's up?	Shhhh. See ya around the ball park.
No!	Martini out!
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?	Prayin', brother. Prayin'.	Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?	'Kay...
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!	Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
Oh yeah...	I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.	Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!	Come an' see.
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?	You's better believe it, brother!
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!	Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?	Ah'm on my knees, brother, ah'm on my knees.
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...	Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?	Okay. How you doing?	Just great!  See ya around!
Hey, how ya doin'?	Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.	What are they?	To help you relax... please...
Please follow me.	You an' me, Chief.
You know, I never got your name.	Miss Itsu.  In here, please.	You comin' in to hold my hand?	No...	Yeah... Well, see ya around, Itsu.
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?	How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
He's a patient, Rose...	Oh, yeah...	Yeah...	Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?	He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...
Who is he?	He's in charge.	Are you a doctor?
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.	Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?	What?
Hi.	Hi.
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.	P.A. What the hell is that?	Potential assaultive.
Hit me!	Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.	Boogered!
Yeah!	Big man!	Yeah, how much you wanna bet?	On what?	That me an' my buddy, Cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn nursery!
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.	Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
Yes, I see it! I see it!	Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
There they are!	Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.	I don't have any.
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...	This way, Mister McMurphy.	Yes, ma'am...
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.	I'm sure you will.	Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.	Oh...
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.	After you, ma'am.	Thank you.
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...	Thank you, ma'am,
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.	Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.	Tha's your problem.	Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?	Huh?	Asshole.
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.	Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.	How 'bout twenty?	Now you talkin'.	Bet!	Bet you ass...	You're a witness, Doc!
What kind of crap is that???	Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!	Take you han's offa me!
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?	No way...
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...	Yes, Miss Ratched!
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.	Evenin', ma'am.	Is everything all right?	Why, sure, ma'am...	The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.	Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.	At this hour?	Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
What are these men doing up wandering around?	Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...	You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!	Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!	Yes, ma'am...	And you haven't heard the last of this!	Yes, ma'am...
Whew! Hiya, boys!	Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
What happened?	What's that?	What?	That!	Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...	Is he one of the loonies?
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.	Are they dangerous when they're awake?	Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies. These are nice guys. Nice guys.
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.	Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
Not exactly, Miss. Not exactly.	Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.	I thought so.	Is he in an asylum?	He's dead.	Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.	That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.	I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...	You ol' fucker!	Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin' a risk of gettin' my black ass fired. If you understand what I mean...
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.	Oh, yeah...	You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...	Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!	Oh, I'm all through talkin'. Now, let's just you an' me trip on down that hall.
He is your husband, no?	Yes, but...  He was having an affair.	Si.
She was your sister.	No, she wasn't my sister.	Your mother.	Of course not.	Your grandmother?	Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
May I see your boarding pass, please?	I-- I must've misplaced it.	I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.	You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.	Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
You didn't have that with you before.  Prima non l'aveva con se.	It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
You ask what room he's in, okay?	Buona notte.
Excuse me?	Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?	He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.	I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?	Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?	Why?	Because.
He said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  Her name's Anna. But she won't be in 'til tomorrow.	So.  How do we get to Rome?
So, what's the story with your friend?	My friend has lost her fucking mind...	What's she doing?
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.	What for?	So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
No, really.  What's she doing?	Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.	Seriously.
Were they pen pals?	No.	Is he some kind of celebrity or something?	No.	Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
"There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, ""Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--"	"--separate, in the evening..."""	Yes.
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?	Your hair... is perfect.
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.	Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
What?...	I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?	It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.	You're sure...	I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
Good.	Let's find a telephone.	Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.	You're sure...	We found each other, didn't we?	Yes.  We did.	It's alright...  this is our destiny.
What?	My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.	What is it?
I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?	"She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about ""communication"".  Like I don't know how to communicate."	Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.	Exactly.
Who's dying?	Your great aunt.	What great aunt?
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?	Oh no.  Do you?	No.
I'm a liberal!	No...	My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
There is one other thing you should know about me.	Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.	I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.	Except possibly that.
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.	Dwayne?	Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
A very large pig.	Ask her if she knows where he is?	Sa dov'e' lui?
No.	Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?	Ha un numero di telefono?
...has a prior commitment.	What's mezzaluna?	A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.	That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.	Wait.  I have to write this down.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?	Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?	If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
We'll KNOW.	Okaaaaayyyy.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.	No.
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?	Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--	Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.	But, Faith--	Please, Larry.  I have to hurry.
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.	But Faith--	What?...
You...	Hi there...	Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.	No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.	My picture's up?
Congratulations.	Thanks.	So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?	I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
It's an amazing place, don't you think?	Amazing.	Smoking or non-smoking?	Non.  Please.
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?	Hm.	Beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing.  Nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it. But, I don't know.  An awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks.
Hello?  Is anybody there?	Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.	He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?	Who's this?	This is his fiancee.  Who's this?	Oh, hi.  I'm an old high school buddy of Dwayne's.  I was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. But I've gotta catch a plane so I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to make it.
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?	My name's	I can hardly hear you.  Could you spell that?
Damon Bradley...	Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
WAIT!!  Where are you?	I'm at the airport.  Why?	Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.	Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
Where are you going?	I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?	Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...	Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
That's not the point.	You said whatever it was you would understand.	That was before I found out what it was.
How could you do this to me?	I'm in love with you.	Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?
You're limping.	I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.	Are you okay?  You want some help?	NO.	You are leaving, aren't you?
Why can't you just tell me?	If it's any of your business, yes.	Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.	Yes.	To the foot doctor.	Yes.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.	He's safe.	So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?	Does he love you?	He wants to marry me, doesn't he?	You didn't answer my question.	Why are you asking me this?	Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?	What?	He's a podiatrist.  Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.	Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.	So?	So it wasn't real.	What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?	No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.	Because I don't have the right name?!
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.	Who says I don't love him?...
Why not?	Because.  I know where he is.
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.	Where's Positano?	It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...	Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.	Look, I know there's no going back for us.  That's not it.  I just want to make this up to you.  Clear my relationship karma.  And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there.  Please.  Let me do this for you.  Let this be my gift to you.
Why?	Because-- I want you to be happy.
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.	He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Uh, I'd rather not say.	Tell me.	I'd really rather not say.	Please.  I need to know.	Mickey Spillane.	Mickey Spillane?	Or Hustler.
He's out by the pool right now.	Right now?	Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.
Do you want me to do it?	NO.
Hi, Peter.	Hi.
So.  You found him.	You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.	Oh.  That's nice.	Yeah.
And she's a knock-out, too.	Well, good.  Good for you.	Anyway, that's why I came by.  I need to fix this button.  Do you have a needle and thread?
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...	Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.	You too.
Hey--	What?	Nice dress.	Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
What?...	What are you doing here?	We were hungry.
You were saying...	Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?	I don't know if that's such a--
Why are you doing this?	I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?	So were you.	Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.	The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
How about music?  You like classical?	The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.	Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
You okay?	Yeah.	I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
I'm sorry.	I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.	No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.	No.  Course not.
Hi.	Hi.  Are you... busy?	No.  Are you're leaving?	No.  I just came by to apologize.
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.	I know the feeling.	Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.	You aren't?	No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.	Well.  Congratulations.	Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.	Are you asking me out?
Yes.  I am.	In that case... no...
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.	I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.	Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
Is something the matter?	GET OUT!!
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?	You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--	There's no such thing.	What?	Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.	Who cares?!  You hired an actor??	I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?	No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.	I can't believe you did that!	And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.	You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.	I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?	Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.	As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.	"A ""little white lie""?  A ""little white lie""?"	What would you call it?	I would call it-- unforgivable.
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.	Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?	Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?	Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.	Very funny.	No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
Really?...	Yes.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.	That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?	If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...	There is no us.
I was hoping for the real thing.	I brought you that, too.
You're Damon Bradley?	Uh huh.
Hello.	Beautiful place...	Sure is.
Been here long?	Just since yesterday.	I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single.
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?	Tonight?	Any night.	Well, not exactly...	Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
Sure.	You would?  Really?
I'll look forward to it.	Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Wait.	Yes?	Aren't you going to tell me who you are?	Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.	It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Sure.	Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.	Really?	Really...
Well, to-- new friends.	And more...
Excuse me?	Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?	Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
What looks good?	Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...	You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
So what do you think?	Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Faith, this is my mother.	Oh, hello.	Mommy, this is Faith.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?	A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
So, what are we waiting for?	What?	Let's face it.  You want me.
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?	Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
I don't believe in statistics.	You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?	No.  He smokes.	How about the other one?  His friend.	Just moved in with his girlfriend.	How about that guy at the bank?
Scientologist.	Oh.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.	Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
I don't have an Amana freezer.	It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.	Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.	I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
Is everything okay?	Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.	But somebody wrote those songs.	So, what's your point?	Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.	No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.	Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
No.	Is he married?	No.	Is he gay?	I don't know.  I don't think so.	So?...	So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
What's he do?	I don't know, Kate.	You don't have any idea?	He's a podiatrist or something.
"""Thrills""?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?"	No.  He's never asked me.	Why don't you ask him?	Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?	If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.	Yes you did.	Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
Come on, it's not so bad.	Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.	I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.	I know...  It was.
But what?	Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.	That's the problem.  When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies.  Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap.  Turn.
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.	Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.	I know.  You're right.	People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive.  It's not settling, Faith, it's life.  Real life.
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?	I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
Kate, is something the matter?	Larry brought me flowers last night.	Is that bad?...	I think he's having an affair.
Have you seen him with someone?	No...  I can just tell.	After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--
It's a miracle.	It's a coincidence.	The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence.
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.	But it's July.	It's still the new year...	What about your job?	I have vacation time coming to me.	You don't have a passport.	That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.	Because you were afraid to fly.	Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.	Does Dwayne know about this?	Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?	Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person.
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.	My God, you have...
Thank you so much.	You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?	He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying.
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...	How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--	Live happily ever after.	Maybe.
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.	You're coming with me?
You okay?	Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
Now what do we do?	The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?	It's called... the Gritty Palace.	"""Gritty""?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?"	I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
This is a Lifestyles hotel.	What?	"""Of the Rich and Famous"".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this."	Are you sure?	Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.	Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.	You gave it your best shot.  You tried.	We lost him?...
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.	You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.	Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
What are you doing?	He fell out.
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.	Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?	I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
I just got a dial tone--	The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?	So?	So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
Ah ha!...	What'd you find?	A Butterfinger wrapper.	A rich, possibly fat, slob.	Maybe there's fingerprints on it?	We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.	Oh.  Right.
We're saved!	What is it?	A phone message.  Only--	Only what?	Only, it's in Italian...
Your brother?	What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
Couldn't we just have taken a train?	The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.	We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.	Right.  So we should've been able to cover more of them.
I'm hungry.	You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.	What's that supposed to mean?...	Nothing.
You expecting somebody you know?	Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.	Sorry.
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?	I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.	You think he misses me at all?	'Course he does.	You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
That was a long time ago.	And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?	Larry bought himself cologne?	Polo.
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--	Her brother.	Right.  My brother.
What did you say to her?	I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--	What's she saying?
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?	You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?	You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.	I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?	Because I'm the one who's single.	I never even got to be single.	Sure you did.	Not if you don't count the sixth grade.	Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
He's heeeeeerrre...	Oh my God.  Where?	He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.	Is he looking at us?	Nope.
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?	Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.	Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it.
Faith--	What?	Good luck.
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.	Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--	And then what, Faith?	And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
That was really sweet...	I meant about my idea.	I think it's time we got some professional help.	Like a detective.	No... Like a psychiatrist.	Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.	But how could he know?  He only just met me.	Men have ways.
Hi-iii...	Hi.  Where've you been?	Sightseeing...  What're you doing?	Packing.	Why?	Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.	So, you've had a little bad luck.	A little bad luck?	Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up.
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.	So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.	I know, but...	It was a ouija board, remember?	...and a fortune teller.	Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.	What about Peter?...	Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.	The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.	Who said I was going?	What?	I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
No.  No, you go ahead.	You sure you'll be okay?	I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.	I'll be back before you leave.
Peter found him?	Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Amazing...	He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
Joan Collins stayed here.	Is Damon Bradley here?
Whatareyoudoing?!	What if he doesn't like me?	It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.	My God... you're right.	Faith, I'm kidding.  Is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.	Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
"Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says ""nuculear"" and ""irregardless""."	No one's perfect, Kate.	And he is living proof.	No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
Maybe I can change him.	I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.	Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
He's a jerk.	Yes.  He is.	I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.	Yup.	I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.	When you could've found one in America.
So...	So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
Kate is that you?	Uh huh.	I didn't expect you back so soon.
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?	Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.	Oh.
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.	And Larry?...	What about Larry?	I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?	He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.	Larry, did you rent a car?
And you are?...	Kate.	You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?	No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.	This is your most lucky day.  My family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?	She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.	A porco?	A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
Oh.	Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.	Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--	I'd love to.
It's siesta.	Oh.	You see, in America they care for work, they live to work.  But in Italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...
How old are you?	What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
Giovanni, I want to thank you.	I thank you.
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.	You don't have to go if you don't want to...	But I do want to.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--	Giovanni.	Huh?	That's exactly what you are.
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.	You miss me?...	Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?	No, why?	Well, there's nothing here to eat.
This is the last one before the wedding, right?	Right.	And we didn't have to bring another present?	No.
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.	It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.	Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.	We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?	Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.	You used to love it when I called you doll.	You said it differently then.
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?	What?  You know him?	It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.	Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?	He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?	Went to high school with him. But...
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.	It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?	Larry, you've got to tell her.	I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
I came after the woman I love.	He missed me.
Yeah--	Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
She what?!	She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--	And you didn't tell her?	She didn't give me a chance.
I have to talk to her.	She's not here.	Where is she?	She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?	No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.	Good strategy.	Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...  When I got hit in the head with this shoe.
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--	Mania.	Whatever.  And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  And He did. She told me the name.  Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.	That's really romantic.
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?	Ten billion to one.
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?	Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.	Thanks.	Sorry...
Right now?	"He just got a call from ""Mr. Upstairs."" Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot."	I'm gonna take her home first.	I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.	I'll come over when I'm ready.	You know Johnny when he gets mad.
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.	Talk louder. I can't hear you.	If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth	If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.	And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?	"When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, ""Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say  Talk with your mouth wide open,"" so if I'm loud don't blame me it's the fault of the nuns!"
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?	Sure we keep records!	Well, where are they?	We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.	Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?	What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.	That's all. Next witness!
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.	The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury.  It softens 'em up.	Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too. Ask any rummy  on the dock if I'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me.  But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin' watchman's pension. When I was sixteen I had to beg for work in the hold. I didn't work my way up out of there for nuthin'.
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.	I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out we take our cut.	Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.	We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?	It'll do.	So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this a deal I sweated and bled for on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.	Gimme.
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.	Why should he forget it?
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.	I'm not thirsty.	After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.	So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.	Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the er as you put it main order of business?	He was always a good kid. You know that.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.	I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?	I wish I knew.	So do I, Charley. For your sake.	What do you want me to do, Johnny?	Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.	Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.	Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.	Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.	Then don't.	But my own kid bro	This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
You said they was only going to talk to him.	That was the idea.	I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.	Maybe he gave them an argument.	I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.	He probably gave 'em an argument.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.	In a minute.
Working hard?	It's a living.
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?	I just fnished work. I counted the bags.	We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.	Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.	Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.	But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.	Let me explain you something, kid. Stooling is when you rat on your friends, on the guys you're with.  When Johnny needs a favor, don't try to figure it out, just do it. Now go ahead, join the congregation.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.	Nolan? I knew he had guts but
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's	Thicker than water.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.	I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.	Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.	The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.	That's right... .	Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.	Mmhmm.	You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.	Mmhmmm.	They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.	A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.	Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.	I always figured I'd live longer without it.	Maybe.
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.	Boss loader!	Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.	And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?	Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?	Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.	You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against	I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.	Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals you know what they're worth to us?	I know. I know.	Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped	Don't say that!	ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?	Don't say that!	What the hell!!!	I could have been better!	The point is there isn't much time, kid.
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!	Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .	Four thirty-seven that isn't where Gerry G...?
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.	Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .	I wish I didn't have to do this, Terry.
Wow... .	What do you weigh these days, slugger?	...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?	Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.	"It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, ""Kid, this ain't your night we're going for the price on Wilson."" It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens This bum Wilson he gets the title shot outdoors in the ballpark!  and what do I get a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money."	I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.	See! You don't understand!	I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.	You don't understand! I could've been a contender. I could've had class and been somebody. Real class. Instead of a bum, let's face it, which is what I am. It was you, Charley.
It was you, Charley... .	Okay I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.	Why Edie, I	How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who?  -- who?	I wish I knew, Edie, But	Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.	Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.	"""In the church when you need me."" Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?"
Father Barry.	Hello, Edie.	I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.	You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
What happened?  What happened?	Tommy, what happened?
Terry...?	Terry... Terry... .
They're waiting for him to walk in.	You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work with all them muscles.	Give it to me my Pop's job	What makes him so special?	None of your business.	Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?
I think we're O.K.	Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.	They play pretty rough.	Which side are you with?	I'm with Terry.	I'll get home all right now.	I better see you get there.
Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies.  Did you know him very well?	Everybody knew him. He got around.	What did that man mean when he said you were... .?	Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.	I better get home.
You know how the Sisters are.	You training to be a nun or something?	It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.	And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?	I want to be a teacher.	A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.	It isn't brains. It's how you use them.	Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in	In braids? That's right.	Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were	I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.	Man, you were a mess!	I can get home all right from here	The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?	The moment I saw you.	Some people got faces that stick in your mind.	I remember you were in trouble all the time.	Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into meI foxed 'em.	Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.	How would you've done it?	With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
What's that?	Pardon me while I reach for my beads.	What?	What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?	When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd get into bad company.	Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little  I better get you home.
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?	Do you like pigeons?	That's my own flock up there, getting their evening workout. I won plenty of races with 'em.  Listen, you want to see them? Come up on the roof with me and I'll show 'em to you.
I'd better go in.	I only live up there and across the roof.	Thanks anyway.	Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?	What for?	I don't know.	I really don't know.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.	Good. So do I.
The Golden Warriors.	I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.	You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.	He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.	That was nice of you.	I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.	I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested in pigeons.	I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.	The things that go on.	How do you like that one?	Oh she's a beauty.
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.	Even pigeons aren't peaceful.	One thing about them though, they're faithful. They get married just like people.
Listen, you like beer?	I don't know.	Want to go out and have one with me?	In a saloon?	Come on, I know a quiet one, with a special entrance for ladies... .
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.	I am?
Wham... .	How do you like it?	It's quite  nice.	How about another one?	No thanks... .	Hit me again, Mac.
Were you really a prize fighter?	I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But I didn't stay in shape and  I had to take a few dives.	A dive? You mean, into the water?	Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
Now what are you doing?	Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.	What made you want to be a fighter?	I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killednever mind how. Charley and I was put in a placethey called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?	Shouldn't we care about everybody?	What a fruitcake you are!	Isn't everybody part of everybody else?	Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?	Terry!	Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.	Our Lord said just the opposite.	I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.	I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body.	What do they do for you, except get in your way?	And when things get in your way or people you just knock them aside get rid of Them is that your idea?	Listen get this straight don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .	Why, Terry, who said it was?	Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.	He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.	Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?	His racket?	You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.	But a priest...?
You don't believe in anything, do you?	Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.	And if you don't?	If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.	But that's living like an animal
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?	Why keep harpin' on it?  Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you?  I'll play you some music.
I I'd like to, Edie, but  there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says	All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.	You haven't finished your beer.	I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.	I got my whole life to drink.
You're not sore at me?	What for?	For not being any help?
What are you crying for?	I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .
I I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And I never knew a girl like you, Edie.	It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.	Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.	Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.	Why should I come hollering to you at all?	Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now but I think we're getting in love with each other.	I can't let myself fall in love with you.	That goes double for me.
What are you going to do?	I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.	It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts you're driving me nuts stop worrying about the truth worry about yourself.	Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.	Don't say that, Edie, don't...
It's true.	I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt What more do you want?	Much more, Terry. Much, much more!
Edie!	I I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.	I don't rate it.	Go ahead, wear it.
Pigeons... .	There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
Edie I I never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you you're... .	I know... I know... .
Edie... Edie... ..	Terry, what's wrong?	I've been sittin' in the church.	You?	Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me he says it's up to me.	Who says?	The Father. The Father.
Terry what's happening to you?	I just told the Father.	Told him what?	What I did to Joey.	You... .	What I did to Joey.	Don't tell me don't tell me!	Edie it's
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.	Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.	You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?	I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.	Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.	How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.	I don't want to hurt Charley I don't want to hurt you...	It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.	I know what you want me to do!	I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.	That  word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .	I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.	I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do..I don't know what to do... .
My hand.	It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.	Edie...	Get away from me.	Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.	I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.	Edie, Edie, I...
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.	I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
Charley.	I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened I'm frightened.
I'll take it out of their skulls.	I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .	I'll take it out of their skulls.
Terry, no, no... .	Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
Terry, you're bleeding.	Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.	Terry, for God's sake.	Get out of my way.	No, I can't let you. I can't, you're
Edie.	I thought you might want some hot coffee.	Thanks just the same.	Well, it's over.	But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.	Are you sure they're your friends?
Jimmy...	He's going to have to grow up too.	My pigeons... .	Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.	Every one of 'em... .	You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland the Middle West somewhere a job on a farm... .	Farm...
Then go ahead go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.	You always said I was a bum. Well  not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
Am I on my feet...?	Terry...?
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.	Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.	Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?	Who is he, Pop?	Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.	Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?	I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.	He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .	A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you hadthe only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .	He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .	Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.	He wanted to see me again.	You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.	And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.	See this arm? It's two inches longer 'n the other one. That's years of workin' and sweatin', liftin' and swingin' a hook. And every time I heisted a box or a coffee bag I says to myselfthis is for Edie, so she can be a teacher or somethin' decent. I promised your mother. You better not let her down.
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.	You are like	Pop!
Where you goin'?	Let me by.
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.	Someone else c'n take your confession.	But you're the one I want to tell what you said over Nolan about keepin' silent when you know the score I'm guilty you hear me? I'm guilty... .	I don't want to hear it in there.	I don't get it!	Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.	But you've got to listen to me.	I'll find you a priest.
It started as a favor for my brother you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no a favor Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.	What are you going to do?	About Edie?	Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.	It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.	A question of who rides who.	If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.	How much is your soul worth if you don't?	But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .	Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you   Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.	Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.	Good luck.	Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?
I want to see you, Terry.	You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.	Now don't give me a hard time.	What do you want from me, Father.	Your gun.	Mind your own business, Father.	This is my business.	Why don't you go and chase yourself?	Give me that gun.	You go to hell.	What did you say?	You go to
Take your hands off me. What you call me?	A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it  Truth is the gun Drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little   cap pistol.
...walk?	Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
You can!	I can? Okay.  Okay...
Who asked him here?	Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?	Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.	D 'n D?	Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
You all right, Nolan?	Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!	Nice fellows.	Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but	But you still hold out for silence?
You still call it ratting?	Are you on the level, Father?	What do you think?	If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?	I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.	Baseball bats that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.	And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.	Down to the wire?	So help me God!	Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies I'm on borried time.
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?	What about it?	I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.	O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?	Our identification.
Waterfront Crime Commission ?  What's that?	We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.	I don't know nothing.
Never will be much too soon.	Take it easy.
You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.	What?	Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.	I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.	You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.	You know what you're askin'? You're askin'
You looking for me?	Not exactly. Just thought I'd sit down and rest my dogs a minute.  You know the next investigation we get into I hope it's got buildings with elevators in them. This one has been nothing but climbing stairs. And when we hit the top ßoor the folks are usually out.
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.	Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?	Wilson yeah  yeah I fought Wilson.	I thought you were going to take him that night but...	You want to know something I would have taken Wilson	I think you could have.	If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him boy, I was ready that night.	You sure looked it. Something go wrong?
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.	Such as what?	Listen, this ain't for publication.	I'm just resting my feet.	Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and	I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.	Yeah. My own blood and they sell me out for a lousy bet I had it in me to hit the top and  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys	Yeah?
Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again.  Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?	Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher hooks over 'n under   whop-whop!	Really?	Yeah, really!
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.	Sure... .
Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?	Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P.
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.	You'll work.	I ought to belt you one, J.P.	Raise a hand to me and... .	... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.	You'd be off the pier for good.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.	O.K., O.K., That's enough.
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?	I told you lay off.	My ain't we touchy this morning?
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.	Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.	Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.	's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.	Boy, you must've been up early.	Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured  They got it made. Eat all they want fly around like crazy sleep side by side and raise gobs of squabs.
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?	Be sure they got enough water.
She's a he. His name is Swifty.	My lead bird. He's always on that top perch.
Better.	Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .	Looking for me?	He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.	Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?	A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!	Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .	You was a Golden Warrior.	Yeah us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?	You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.	But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
Is Johnny in?	No.	No?
Give me a double.	Take it easy now, Terry.	Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.
What's wrong with your shoulder?	Hit me again.	Listen, kid, why don't you go home before Johnny... .
No advice. Just whiskey.	Easy. Easy, boy.
You ought to go home and take care of that	First things first.
Terry?  What do you want?	Hey look-
Yeah? Must be Danny-boy. I lost him in the last race.	He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?	Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?	I'll bring him up to your loft.	I'll see you on the roof.
Hey, Skins  --get away with that sheet metal all right?	Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss.	Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.	Forty-five bills.	Hey, Terry, front and center.
I I musta counted wrong, boss, I	Gimme.
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?	So-so, Johnny.	Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
Count this.	Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.	It's good for you. Develops your mind.
Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.	Not a dent.  Perfect	My favorite little cousin.	Thirty-six sev aah I lost the count.	OK skip it, Einstein. How come you never got no education like the rest of us?
I know, Johnny, I know... .	Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this  to remember them by.
Do you?	Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.	Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I	Go on a little present from your Uncle Johnny.  And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.  Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?	Thanks, Johnny... .
I I was just on my way up, Johnny.	By way of Chicago?
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?	Aw, Johnny... .	I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.	Nothing happened, Johnny.	Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.	It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.	Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.	You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.	He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.	How'd you get that.	I got it. Hot off the press.
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.	Now just a minute, I
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.	Listen, Johnny	Go on beat it. Don't push your luck.	You want to know somethin'?	I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it.
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin' take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros  away and you're a great big hunk of nothing  Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!	Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .	I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap connivinggood-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done you hear me? glad what I done!	You ratted on us, Terry.	From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .	Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
You got some nerve.	What do you mean?
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.	I was only talkin' to her.	She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.	I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.	Not that free.
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?	Go on, beat it!	A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?	Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!	Thanks for nothing, you bum.
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.	Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.	One little dime you don't need.  I know you you're Edie Doyle. Your Brother's a saint  only one ever tried to get me my compensation.
Yeah, yeah Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.	I can't believe it a small fortune.   You can't buy me you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey.	Look who says bum!
A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!	Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again.
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.	When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?	Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself.  Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.	Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.	I wonder how many Hail Marys the Father'll make me say at confession.  It'll be worth it! The pallet is loaded now. Terry turns and approaches Nolan.
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.	Keep Charley out of this.	You don't think he'd be helpful?	Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.	Maybe I will one of these days.	One of these days.
Listen Nolan	What are you down here for to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?	Nolan... .
Leave her alone, you fiend!	Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.	If I could get my hands on you...	..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.	Leave her alone, I tell you!	I do not joke in my proposal.
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.	No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.	But does it have to be in a cemetery?	You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.	But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.	Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--	But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?	Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.	That's life.  My kisses are alive.	Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
All of my books are based on fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps why they're more interesting and sell in the top spots.	Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.	There's an old cemetery on this road. I've been there before.
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!	Okay.
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.	Where?	In there.	It frightens me.	Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.	Then..then what's that music?	That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.	What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?	Something's making that music.	I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.	All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.	What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?	Not dead?  In a cemetery?	I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.	Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.  They'll have a telephone.  C'mon.
Could it be some kind of college initiation?	It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!	Can't we get out of here?	I'm not sure...	What do you mean?	I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
Look!	Be careful!--They'll see you.
I'm so frightened.	You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.	Those creatures..!	Don't let them hear you.	What can we do?	I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.	I'm afraid I'll faint.	Whatever you do, don't do that.
The ropes are coming loose.	Be careful!	I am--It's our only chance.	Nothing is worth your life.	My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.	I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.	Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.	Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.	You do?	Yes I feel it in my bones.	You're talking nonsense.	Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.	They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>	I should hope not.  I hate you!	That sudden?	Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.	...And I thought you loved me.
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.	What can we do against them?	I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.	I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.	All right.  Put it on heavy.	My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.	<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.	Maybe so.
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?	There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.	You love me then?	Of course I do.
But they are not yet one of us.	A situation easily remedied.	Tie them that they may watch.
...And what is this?	A symbol, Master.	What kind of symbol?	She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.	El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.	Her dance has pleased me.
She was?	As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.	Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.	It would seem so, Master.
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes.	Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.	As you wish, Master
Yes, yes yes I know all that.	At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.	I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.	It would seem so, Master	Ahh, but I declare there is still time for <i>some</i>thing.
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!	The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
Well?	Ahh, she will be yours.	When!?	At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.	The moon is almost gone!	Ahh, there is yet time.	At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...	I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.	I would have time for my own pleasures!	Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.	I understand, Master	Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?	There are others.	Well then let us proceed.
The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.	I will decide the conclusion.	You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.	Then cancel my order.	The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>	There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?	Oh, if there is only time!	Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>	All others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to <i>her</i>  This one would have <i>died</i> for feathers, furs, and fluff...and so she did!
The time...is short.	For what!?!	Your pleasures of course!	You mean...!	You may take her now.	Is there time?	You better hope there is.	Thank you, Master!  Thank you.	Now hurry, hurry.  I will watch!  Your desires may be my pleasure also...Our fitting climax to an evening's enter- tainment.  You must...hurry now.
They are live ones?	Yes, Master.	Live ones where only the dead should be?	Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?	You know better than that.	We don't know of anything, Master...	Then why do you shake so?	It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.	Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.	Aaaahhhh.
Then it is some service you desire of us.	You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master	Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.	Yes, sir, Master.
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!	I'm so frightened.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.	I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.	AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.	You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
No. No! No!	I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.	Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?	Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!	Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.	Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!	When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.	Aaarrrgggaahh.
He wants us.	Aaahhnnnahnnnn.	What do you suppose for?	Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?	Did you do something to get us into trouble again?	Aannnnaahhnn.	Did you howl off-key at the moon again?	Aannnnaahhnn.	I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
I could make her another Cleopatra...	Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!	Without the snake, of course.
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?	Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?	You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.	Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?	I said not as a rule.	So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?	Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.	What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.	What happened to Mandrake the Magician?	Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--	Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...	And the one driving the other car?	What're you talking about?	Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.	Glenn Michaels.	Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.	He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first.
Oh, is this Adele?	Yes, it is.	Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.
I want to speak with you, please.	Who is it?
Lie face down on the floor.	What?!
Yes.	You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?	Yes.	Tell me, how do you do that?
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?	From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?	They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.	But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?	I know a Glenn.
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?	No, thanks.
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?	You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.	He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.
You didn't visit him in prison.	He didn't want me to.	Why not?	I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.	But you spoke to him on the phone.	He'd call every once in a while.	He called the day he escaped.	He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?	He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.	Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.	Did you know that when you married him?	"He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, ""Okay.""  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband."
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.	Really.  Hm.
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.	Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.	Till they got busted.	That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.	Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
Ask him his name.	Who are you?
You're good.	Thank you.
Adele?  You in there?	Yes.
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.	Oh.  Uh-huh.	You did work for Emil, right?	Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.	You were his what, his box?	His assistant.
You say you perform in the Miami area?	Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
I'm not dressed.	Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!	Tell me where is Jack Foley, I don't bother you no more.
I don't know where he is.	Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.	Go away, or I'll call the police.	Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
It's Richard Ripley.	The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.	Why don't we talk about it later?
Where in the hell are we?	That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.	Okay, honey, come on out of there.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?	She's coming with us.
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?	Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
Do we need him?	The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
Wait a minute.  Let me have your raincoat.  Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.	I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.	How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?	His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you and me figured the whole thing out.
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.	He ain't the problem, Jack.
"You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, ""Oh, I had you all wrong""?"	I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.	You're too late, Jack.
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.	Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.	You're right.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.	There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.	Oh, man.	There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.	I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.	There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.	Sounds great.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.	I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.	Maybe this'll make you feel better.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.	Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?	Just that she got away.	Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?	You'll have to ask Glenn.  And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be.
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.	Am I going to Detroit by myself?
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.	We'll leave first thing in the morning.
What?!	You better come see this.
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.	He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.	He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.	He knows where she lives?
Jack?	We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.	So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.	Her phone's probably tapped.	And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.	Shit.
Nice disguise.	I'm a tourist.	You at least bring the gun?	In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.	Uh-huh...
I guess Adele's in good hands.	Sure looks that way.	Let's go to Detroit.	Now you're talkin'.
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.	I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?	Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.	Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?	Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.	He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.	She just sat there, looking right at me.
"""Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying.""  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years."	Love is funny.
Whatta you think?	I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.	Or two.
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?	What's he do now, tell fortunes?
Outside of that.	Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.	She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather.
I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?	They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.	You tell your sister about it?	Just hung up.	How long you talk to her?	Two hours.	How long were you with the girl?	Forty-five minutes.	You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.	Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.	Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
Now that's a really big house.	Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.	No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.	Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.	Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?	Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.	Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.	Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?	What about that D.B. Cooper guy?
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.	Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?	My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?	Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.	You might not have a choice.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.	They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?	Yeah, and I better call my sister.
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?	I saw Karen Sisco.
And she saw you?	Yes, she did.	So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?	You know how I felt about her.	Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.	It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.	You find out?	Yeah, I did.
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?	I don't know.
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.	Whatta you wanna do?
You know they gonna set us up.	I get that feeling, yeah.	But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.	Half for doing what?	Getting me out of Glades for starters.	And who watches your back?
There's still time, take me up on my offer.	I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
You ever wear one of these?	I don't ski.	Stay with the maid.  I'm gonna have a look around.
They found the safe.	You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?	Yeah, hi.  Nice house.
They look like plain old rocks.	They sure do.
Come <i>on</i>.	Shit.	What?	They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.	From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.	And then they'll kill 'em.	At least.
We made it, didn't we?	All you gotta do is get in.
I'm going back inside.	I'll go with you.
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.	Jack --	Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about to go down, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month.  Let me do this part alone.
Hello, Daniel.	Daniel Burdon, FBI.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.	That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.	Isn't that my report you're holding onto?	Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?	Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you.  Buddy is it?  And this fella Jack Foley.  I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.	Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.	You talked to him?	In the trunk, yeah?	What'd you talk about?	Oh... different things, prison, movies.	This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?	It was an unusual experience.	Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?	When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.	Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.	And what happened to Carl?	The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?	Is that what you would've done?	You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.	Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.	Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.	Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?	I have to qualify, is that it?	You have to know what you're talking about.
We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.	You'll have to ask him.	Sounds to me like he liked having you around.  I'll see you, Karen.  Mr. Sisco.
Shut up.	Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.	Daniel.  Listen --	Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.	I'm at Adele Delisi's.	What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.	Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?	There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...	All right, but...	But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.	Sure, Daniel.	Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?	Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?	What?  Is that what you're calling me about?	Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?	Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.	That's all I wanted to know.	Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
You get the key?	They're in 7D.
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.	You're gonna use a ram?	Yeah, why?	The manager's door is metal.
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.	What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.	You can go wait out in the car, you want to.
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?	Call and tell you.	And you let them come up.  You don't try to make the bust yourself.  You understand?
Leave it where it is.	Wait.  You not Adele?	I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.	Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
Put it down or I'll shoot.	You wouldn't shoot me, would you?	What do you want to bet?	I could walk out of here.	If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.
You can live or die, it's up to you.	Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.	You don't, huh?
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.	Excuse me, Adele?
You excited?	I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.	Yeah, but I see you moved it up.	Why you think is today?	You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice.  But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five.  Saving yourself for the main event.  Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.	You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.	I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
Ironic, isn't it?	How are you, Raymond?	Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
Quite a mess.	Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.	Who?	Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.	What is it with crack and transsexuals?	Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.	Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.	Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?	I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.	You know, I'm not in homicide any more.	No, I didn't know that.	Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.	Detroit, you must be pretty busy.	Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.	Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.	Who was the friend?	Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.	Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.	I'll need a last known address.	That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.	Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
Hello?	We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?	Oh-kay...
Karen, I told you not to--	Wait, I know him --okay?
"Sign says ""Shut the fuck up.""  Or can't you guys read?"	There a problem, Foley?	Yeah.
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?	That's right.
How much for your company at chow?	Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.	I bet.  How much?	Another C.
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?	I don't smoke.
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.	Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.	It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?	Low class of people there, Snoop.
Like being back in the yard, huh?	Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?	Glenn didn't tell you?
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.	Let's go outside and talk.	What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.	Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
Who's sitting here?	Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.	We're leaving.	The fuck you talking about?	Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?	I thought everything.
Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.	Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.	You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.	I wasn't asking permission.
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?	Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.	So you've done this before, huh?	Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.	That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.	Hey.  You learn from doing.
You know how to use one a these?	I've seen 'em used on TV.
Good luck, Richard.	Someone down here?
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?	Not until recently.	Nervous?	A little.	This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?	You're right.  So why take a chance--
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?	I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
You comfy?	If I could have a little more room.	There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?	For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.	You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
Where's your gun, your pistol?	In my bag, in the car.
Boy, it stunk in there.	I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.	Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?	The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.	Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.	You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.	If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.	Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.	Buddy.  That's his given name?	One I gave him, yeah.  Fuck...
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.	Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.	Why, are you famous?	Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.	How many was that?	Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.	That's funny.	I thought so, too.	It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.	I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.	I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.	Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?	I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
You don't seem all that scared.	Of course I am.	You don't act like it.	What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.	Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.	You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.	It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.	Uh-huh.	We still talk, though.	Sure.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.	Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.	You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.	I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?	Is that right?	They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.	You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?	It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.	Faye Dunaway.	Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...	<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.	And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...	Peter Finch.	Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.	Bleeding on a country road.	It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you.
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.	Nothing.	I mean if you didn't know who I was.	You'd probably tell me.	I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...	You have to be kidding.
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.	With Robert Redford, when he was young.	Yeah...
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.	Really.	I mean, romantically.	Uh-huh.  Well, but if --
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.	Shit...
You know who this is?	Yes.
How'd you get this number?	Who was it answered the phone?	None of your business.	I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.	That's my dad.	Really.  He has a cop's face.	How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.	And your gun.	Think I could have them back?	How do we do that?	Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.	Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.	You won't do that.	Why not?	Because you're having too much fun.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.	I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.	Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?	Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?	Unless you wanna tell me.	He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.	One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.	I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.	Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?	I just thought maybe you and me could--
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.	I can go to the bar.	Don't leave me.	Those guys bother you?	No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here.
You like bourbon?	Love it.	Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?	I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.	Is that how you think of yourself?	What, as a sales rep?	A girl.	I don't have a problem with it.	I like your hair.  And that suit.	I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.	You did?	It smelled.	Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?	No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?	How far do we go with this?
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?	I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?	It's your game.  I've never played this before.	It's not a game.  Something you play.	Well, does it make sense to you?	"It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, ""What if I had stopped and said something?""  It might happen only a few times in your life."	Or once.
Oh, God...	I called your room from downstairs.	If I had answered, what were you gonna say?	Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.	If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?	It would be worth the risk.
You like taking risks.	So do you.
You really wear that suit.	That's not what you were about to say.
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.	She did, huh.	You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.	Yeah, but in a nice way.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.	He killed a police officer.
I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.	You believe that?	Why not?
What were you gonna do with me?	I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.	You waved to me in the elevator.
I wasn't sure you caught that.	I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...	Really?  I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.
You know I saw you on the street.	Where?	Outside Adele's.
You were going to see her?	To warn her about Chino.	So she did help you?	I don't think we should get into that.	No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.	Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.
You coming back?	I'm just going to the bathroom.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.	Why are you mad?	Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.	What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?	I don't know.
You're not dumb.	I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
You getting serious on me now?	I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.	You know.
Come on, Jack -- don't.	Pretend I'm somebody else.	You think I'd shoot you?
If you don't, one of those guys will.	What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.	I told you, I'm not going back.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.	You just did, for Christ sake.	You know what I mean.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!	Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.	You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!	I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.	I'll take the shades off.  Just get this fuckin' thing off me.
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.	Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.	So.  What's your point?	My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.	You think he's lying?	Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else.	Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?	Oh, nuthin'.
Take your sunglasses off.	I see better with them on.	You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head.
Wait in the car.	You're in civilization now, man, ease up.	I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.	In the trunk?	The backseat.
Weren't you expecting us?	That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
"She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  ""I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."""	Yeah?  She said that to you?
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?	I don't know...
Whose blood you got all over you?	These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
I thought you guys were busted.	Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?	How many?	I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.	Okay.  How many going out?	I hear six.	When?	Looks like tonight.	You know who they are?	I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.	Oh, uh, right, thanks...
Sounds high, doesn't it?	Must be a real soft pillow.
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.	Really?  Well, I uhhh...	First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you.
Thanks for your help.	Any time.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?	I don't know.  I never used a gun.	Really?	You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.	You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.	No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.	I know what you're talking about.	You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.	Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?	Of course not.	Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.	Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.	It's a big house.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?	Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?	I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way.  I'm talkin' about when you're outta here.  I mean, you can't rob banks for ever.
It's a little late for me.	Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.	I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.	Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.	My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.	No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.	The fish?	Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.	I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.	The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.	And the guy sent you a bill for this?	It works.  You should try it sometime.	The next time I walk into a bank.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.	What's to think about?	You goin' right back to work?	First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.	"How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying ""sign in here please"" or ""hey, pal, you can't park there.""  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it."	Jack, I'm disappointed.  I guess I misjudged you.
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?	"Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally ""relaxed..."""
Foley?  That you?	How are you, Richard?	Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?	Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.	Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
Have they got Midge up there?	What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?	We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.	A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?	You gonna write me a check?	We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a withdrawal.
Good God... they're shooting Midge!	Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.	I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?	Five point two.
I were you, I'd get up and run.	I'm not leaving Midge.	Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.	If that's my fate, so be it.  I'm not leaving.  I love her, Jack.
<i>Hejira?</i>  What kinda name is that?	Islamic.	"What's it mean, ""No Hair""?"	The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.	The flight?	The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.	You were at Leavenworth, huh?	For a time.	Meaning?	Meaning time came, I left.	You busted out?	I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.	And how long was it before they caught up with you?	That time?	There were others.	Yeah.  That was the ninth.	The <u>ninth</u>?	Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.	You must be some kinda walker, Henry.	Hejira.	And so now you're off to Glades.	Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.	She did, huh.	Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.	Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.	Like what?	I don't know.  It's a long way down to Florida.
I'll send it to you at Glades.	Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--	Glenn?
You don't remember me, do you?	It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.	No, that's not what I'm thinking.
But you're sure we've met, huh?	Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
Do we have a gun in the car?	I remember you now.  Shit.	Foley's not going to make it.  And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.	We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--	Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
Take the next exit.	What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?	Glenn, take the exit.	No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?	Jesus, I don't believe it.	Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.	You're not?	I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?	The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.	Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.	You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?	For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.	Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.	What's going on, Glenn?	Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.	But I thought the whole thing was your idea?	Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.	Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?	Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.	And is Foley a part of this?	He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.	Why's that?	Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.	But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?	I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.	Gee, I wonder why not.	I'm freezing my ass off.	You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.	Really?	But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...	I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.	If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.
Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.	Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you.
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.	You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.	I wanna talk to you about a job.	Uh-huh.	I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.	Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.	It's a guy you know.	Gimme another hint.	It's Richard Ripley.
You there?	Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.	Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.	It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros.  I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players.  Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left.  Yeah.  The brick wall.  There's his drive, right there.
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?	If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?	I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.	What?
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.	You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
Thing I'm worried about is you.	Me?	Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.	Can I do what?	Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.	What-- when?	Right now, son.	I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.	Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.	I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.	Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this car, man, it's mine.  You go get yourself another one.  I say I'm in on Ripley?  I'm in, with or without <i>your</i> ass.  I say I want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do?
That was some shit, huh?	Why'd he have to do that to that girl?	Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.	No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.	Why would I do that?
Hi, Ray.	You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?	He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.
How's it going?	Great.  We got one of 'em.
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.	Oh...	We went out there, full SWAT, two choppers, the whole bit, but Linares started shooting anyway.  We put him down, but somehow Chirino got away.
You're a fighter?	How you know that?	I can tell.	I <i>was</i>...
What'd you fight, middleweight?	Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?	Flyweight.	"You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, ""You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you.""  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl."	You're not my type.	Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.	Just a minute.
What's wrong with you?	You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
Moselle Miller?	What do you want?	I'm looking for Maurice.	You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
That's not Maurice?	That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's talking on the phone.
You like to sit down?	Thanks.
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.	You not with probation, one of those?	No.	You a lawyer?	No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels?
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.	He said he stayed here last November.	Here?  In this house?	He said he stayed with Maurice.	Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?	Your dog was killed?	Got run over by a car.	What did you call it?
Was a she, name Tuffy.	Where do you think I might find Maurice?	I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.	The State Theater?
You fit another Chanel suit in here?	Something better.  Open it.
It's beautiful.	It's a --	--Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.
Thanks, Dad.	Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?	Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.	Which one is that?  The ATF guy?	He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.	He's still married though, huh?	Technically.  They're separated.	Oh, he's moved out?	He's about to.	Then they're not separated, are they?	Can we change the subject?	What're you doing at Glades?	Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.	You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.	No thanks.	You used to like it.	Dad...	You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.	I really gotta go.	We don't get to talk much any more.	How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?	I'd like that.
You were talking in your sleep.	What'd I say?	"""Hey, yourself."""	Huh.
What are you thinking about?	The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.	Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas.
He doesn't even look like that.	No?	No, he looks a lot...
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.	I see that.
Was it Foley?	Off a tip?
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.	Hello?
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?	He's pretty laid back, confident.	He remind you of that guy, Tillman?	Not at all.	But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.	I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.	Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.	My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.	You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.	Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.	Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike.  It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.
He waved to you?	I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.	You wave back?	I didn't have time.	I imagine you would've though.
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.	So?	So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.	He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?	None I'd like to share.
You gonna go get him?	It's possible.  Why?	I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.	He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.	My little girl, the tough babe.
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?	I told you, he isn't here.	Out for the evening?	He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.	When's he due back?
You here all by yourself?	That's right, just me.
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.	I don't have any idea.	Let's go upstairs, have a look at the man's bedroom.  All right now, you and Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here. Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it.  Look at the walls in the closets.  The man has a safe, it's gonna be up there somewhere.
How do I look, mama?	Like a fag.
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...	The combination is three-ten-forty-four.
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.	Likewise.
"In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, ""Undercover""?"	No.  Course not.
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--	I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
Did you pay the guy the reward?	Yeah, as soon as we got back.
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.	I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.	That's how you score now?
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.	So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Thank you...	Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.	What?	Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.	I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...	Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.	Well, I need that...	...and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's.
Faux goose down.	Still...
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?	Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.	Are those <i>my</i> suits?	Where you been hiding, Dick?
Midge.	Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.	Foley's got it.	Where the fuck is Foley?
We have a problem here?	Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?	Ten gees.	Uh-huh.  You recall, did it say dead or alive?
I think he must've fell in.	I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
I found a rubber.	White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
...the fuck is this...	Are they dead?
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!	That's your line for tonight, ya know.	What, good-lookin' sumbitch?	"No, numbnuts, die.  You get your nurse alone, you look her in the eye, and say, ""Baby, they're training me for war, and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow, I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight.""  I've never known it to fail."
Are you sure they're here?	If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.	He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?	You mean hiding them?	Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm talking about how you make them show!
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!	Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.	He was that good?	No, I was.
I wish she could forget him.	You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.	Red...Strange?	You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.	But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?	How would I know.
Do you always stutter?	Only when I'm n-n-n-	Nervous?	Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?	That's me, Sir.	Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.	If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.	Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?	Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
You're Walker, right?	Yes Sir.	That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.	You liked that?	Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.	Sir?	I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.	Hale-what?	You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.	Sir, I --	Too late for apologies, Walker.	I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.	Where's that lizard?	What lizard?	The one that slept in my mouth last night.	What the hell happened to you guys?
Yeah.	Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
Rafe's girl, Evelyn?	You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --
Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...	A m-missionary?	No, like...
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.	You guys are new?
Shit, he's puking on my feet!	Well, you p-puked on his feet.	Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!
They ready, Earl?	They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!	You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?	Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.	Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Who the fuck taught you to fly?	He did.
Bandits at 2 o'clock.	Power dive!
It's Germans!	Kill the bastards!
Good shooting, Danny!	Good shooting, Rafe!	Land of the free...	Home of the brave!	There's another one!
Didn't you say test the limits?	Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
How could you do this?	The Colonel helped me work it out.	I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?	I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.	Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.	Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
Nah, you go on.	I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.	Some other time.  I don't feel like a party.
Didn't you say you told her not to come?	Yeah.	Then why are you looking for her?	It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.	Upset?  Why should I be upset?	Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're scared to talk about it.
Sorry.	Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.	I didn't mean it.	Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.	Waitress!  Four beers!	You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.	If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
We gotta face some facts here.	What facts are those?	I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.	I was grieving too.	Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.	So what are you saying?	I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.	You left her.  How's that for a fact?	How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
How come you're not pukin'?	I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.	Fuck you.	She loves you.  I know that.  And part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me.
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.	How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
Get me into a plane!	Come on!
Where are we going?	Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.	What's there?	Six P-40's.
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!	They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
It's tight.	Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
They're all over us!	Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
You hear my okay?	Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.	I got a half a tank.  You?	Little less.
Land of the free.	Home of the brave.
I'm out of ammo!	I'm out of fuel!
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.	What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
Fun today.  Like old times.	Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?	What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.	No.  You're trying to beat me.	We've always tried to beat each other.	Bullshit.  We've played with each other, pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?
Maybe just trying to measure up.	What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
It's shorter than our practice runway.	They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.	"We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. ""Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork.""  It means ""Who the fuck thought up this shit?"""
It's not getting any longer.	Longer?  It's getting shorter.
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.	We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.	And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.	Home of the Brave.
Danny...	I can't make it.	Yes you can.
Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?	The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.	What about easier to hit in an air raid?	Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?	Yeah.	We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.	Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.	He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.	Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.	You were more like brothers.	I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.	He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.	...He said that?
How's everything?	We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.	That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.	I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?	I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
Sorry.	He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.	Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?	Well...sure.	From the air?
So beautiful!	Hang on.
And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.	The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.	We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.	Then wh-where do we land?	"I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  ""Lushu hoo megwa fugi.""  It means ""I am an American.""  In Chinese."
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.	I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.	I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.	Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --	No baseball diamonds, Red.	Y-Yes Sir.
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.	How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?	Don't get smart with me, son.	"Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a ""homage."""	That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.	Thank you, Sir.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.	Thank you, Sir.
I heard what you did.	We can explain, Colonel.	Explain what?
Is that the good new, Sir, or --	You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?	Well sure, Colonel --	Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.	Bombers.	I want to introduce a couple of people. Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission, because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.	I take it back, about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.	Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.	I know.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.	Our doctor's gone too.	Sorry to trouble you.	Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
How'd you get this?	Boxin'.	Win?	Yes'm.
What's your name?	Dorie Miller, 'Mam.	I'm Evelyn.  And I'm just a nurse.  But I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs sewing, or else it's gonna make a big lumpy scar.  Whatta ya say?
How often you fight like this?	Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.	What do you get for winning?	Respect.
Thank you, 'Mam.	Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?	I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man.  They made me a cook -- and not even that, really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's shoes.  In two years, they've never even let me fire a gun.
You take care, Dorie.	You too, 'Mam.
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.	You too, Lieutenant.
Oh, this is Betty.	Nice to meet you, Betty.
Danny's not coming?	No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.	I was hoping to meet him.
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.	The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.	It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.	We're all going away.	I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.	But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --	Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.	You waited til tonight to tell me?	I had to tell you in person.  Because there's something else I need to say.
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.	I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.	Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.	Do one thing for me, before you go.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.	Why were you sitting here, instead of...	I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.	How did you?...	...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me.  I hit the water hard.  And it was so...cold.
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.	I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?	Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.	I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.	It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --	Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.	It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
What else can we do?	There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
Rafe --	I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.	Rafe... No.  You forgive me.	Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.	That's what I have to tell you, Rafe.  It wasn't a choice.  It --
What?...	They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.	It must of been a convincing letter.	It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.	I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.	If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.	Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.	Brilliant, Admiral.	A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.	We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.	We must go ahead.  This is our moment.
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.	The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!	And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
What if the Japanese did invade?	We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.	Have the planes made it to China?	There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.	So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.	The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.	God help them.
Leapin' Jesus!	The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.	Well which of those three ya want fixed?	All of 'em.
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!	And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.	Fook ya!	Learn English, then!	Fook ya dooble!
I have'na been able ta --	Crank her!
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.	If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.	The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader.
You have something to say, Yamamoto?	The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.	You see us as capable of such a blow?	The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
Hello, Lilla!	Peggy Sue!
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.	I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventyfive? Eighty?	I'm not telling.	I've been trying to drag it out of her for years.  You know, dreams are fascinating business. 'Specially where you see the future.
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?	It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
Do you believe in all of that?	Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.	I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.	That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.	It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.	Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?	I'd take better care of my teeth.
Let's go.	Goodbye, Grandma.
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?	Stag movies. Smokers.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.	I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?	The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
Do you have to wear that hat?	It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.	This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..	How do you like my hair?	It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible.
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.	Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.	Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.	Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?	Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.	Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.	Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?	I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
Carol!	Peggy Sue!
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.	You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
Welcome to the singles scene.	I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.	You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.	We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.	So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.	It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.	After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.	Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.	Wouldn't we all.
"Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance."	Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?	Who knows. Remember...  Whatever Walter wants...
The only one?	Well, besides Charlie, of course.
They're waiting. Come on.	I can't. It's all too much.	Go on. You can do it.
Where is it?	Were taking you back to the nurse.	Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
We're going to take you home.	That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
I'll call you Later.	Yes. Let's stay in touch.
I don't get it.	That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?	Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.	He does?
All right. What's the scoop?	On what?
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?	Just what you underlined.	You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.	Come on. What's with you and Michael?
I bet Dolores told Charlie.	That loudmouthed little bitch~
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.	Aren't we a little old for that?
What's the matter?	It's that jerk Walter.	What happened?	After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.	Welcome to the singles' scene.	What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.	Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
Lucky lady. Hi.	Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.	Why do guys do such stupid things?
Charlie really has a great voice.	Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.	That's disgusting!	") Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that ""the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it"". Page eightysix."
Peggy Sue!	You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!	Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
And we're here on the couch...	Don't say that...
We're here on the sofa bed...	Charlie...	...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.	I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
But you love me don't you?	Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.	And nothing will ever change that.
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.	Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.	I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.	I mailed it to you on Wednesday.	Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.	Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
You got a Tab?	I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...	I know. Put Scott through college.	I'll think of a way to sell, them.  One day.
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?	I'm not going.
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.	Charlie! Am I dead?	No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie.  Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
How do you feel?	Pretty strange.
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.	Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
You drive like a maniac!	I call this the staccato.	Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.	Oh yeah?	You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.	Refresh my memory.	How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?	Maybe I blocked it out.	I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?	Why wait?	Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?	They'll learn to live with it.
Want me to drive you home later?	Would you?	Would I?!! Why I oughta...
Looking good out there.	Thanks.	I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.	I thought it had a lot of merit.	In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...	Rejected, worthless, miserable.	Yeah. Like that.	Good.
Where did you get that sweater?	Great, isn't it?	It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.	Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?	Right. I promised my mother.	Is this slow enough for you?	Charlie, how are you?	I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?	Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?	Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?	He's trying.	Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?	Come on, let's dance.
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..	You're pretty charming when you want to be.	Yeah I know.  But I don't have to flatter you.  It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me.  As in is, was and always will be.  I'm glad dancing was invented.  You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.	Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.	You really love me, don't you?	You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.	Charlie, let's make love.	What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?	A lot's happened since last weekend.	But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.	I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?	Who?
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!	You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.	You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
I'm sorry Charlie.	Save it.
What do you know about classical music?	Nothing.. Selling is selling.	Charlie. About last nights..	Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.	But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.	Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?	Why?
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.	What am I going to do with you?	Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.	I have to talk to you..
What are you doing here?	Let's go down to the basement.
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...	I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.	"Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did ""Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..."" I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?"	You know I never could stand your sarcasm.	You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.	And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?	Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.	Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.	I will be happy if I have you. I love you.	That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.	What are you talking about? Who's Janet?	I just can't trust you anymore.	What about everything I said to you this afternoon...	That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!	But what has to be different?	Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.	What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?	I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.	You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.  ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian!
What're you doing here?	I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.	Rusty's dead. That's Ajax
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?	Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.	Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..	How'd you know about that?	I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.	Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?	What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.	Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.	That's real big of you.	Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.	You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.	Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.	Just take a look at it.	If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
Does this mean you like me again?	It means I care about you and what happens to you.	That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
Forget it, it'll never work.	Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?	I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.	Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.	You're going to listen to me.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?	Right here. Now sit down.
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.	How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.	What?	"You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, ""Peggy, you're scared."" Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless."	You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!	I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?	Of course.
Oh, Charlie.	It opens, too. Look inside.
I love you.	I know.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.	Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?	What the hell is that?
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!	I've got to go now.	But I love you. I'll love you forever.	I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.	Come back to me.	I'm trying.
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...	Charlie? Was I dead?	I thought you were...for a while.	You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.	But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.	Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.	I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.	What about Janet?	That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.	I'll just set it right here.
"Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing ""I Wonder Why""."	Oh, God, Dion.	You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.	I'll never give up.	Then hold me.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.	Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.	Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
Hello, Charlie.	Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?	Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
Yes, sir.	She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.	Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.	Yes, sir. Trust is a twoway street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.	What would that be, sir?	Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.	Of course.
Did you study for the test?	Test?
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.	First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.	God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.	Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.	Are you for real?	Touchy, touchy!
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.	Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!	I beg your pardon?	Take a long walk on a short pier.	Have a nice day.
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.	What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
Terry, slow down.	Okay.	Terry! Slow down.	What, why?
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.	That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.	First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?	That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.	I wish she hadn't.	I'm not afraid. I know exactly when I'm going to die.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.	But I'm remembering the future.	Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.	My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.	He won't tell me, but I've got my suspicions. And I don't want any of that. Don't keep her out late.
It was Beth's idea.	I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.	It must run in the family.
Don't get your hopes up.	Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?	She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.	He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.	But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.	I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.	Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.	You don't?	He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk...	Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.	A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.	What're you doing here anyway?	Coffee and a donut.	I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.	Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
This is great reefer.	Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.	The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.	What are you shooting for?	Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellO for me, Mom.'	Don't you get along with your parents?	The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.	They care about you. They're just a different generation.	Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?	I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.	Is that one of your poems?	No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?	I'd love to.	Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you.
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.	I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone.  To freedom.	For everyone.	Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...	Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?	Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.	I can't do that.	Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.	I hate chickens.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.	Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.	But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.	That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.	You think so?	Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.	I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
It's Charlie!	What a treat.
Ssh. He's great.	Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
I thought I knew everything about him.	Can we split now?
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.	What?	My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
Young lady, you're drunk!	Just a little. I've had a tough day.	I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.	Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.	Evelyn, put her to bed.
Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.	That would be impossible.	You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.	Mom, is there any coffee left?
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?	I think I'm way ahead of them.
Damn that Charlie I	It's not Charlie. It's me.	Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?	At my age? Don't be silly.	Thank God for that.	Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?	Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.	Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.	All right. But this better be good.	I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.	Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.	I think they're going to deregulate it.	That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.	Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.	I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!	Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!	Evelyn, take her to her room!
Hi, Dad.	Doing some shopping?
For me?	Open it.
I closed my Christmas club.	Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.	I wanted to apologize for this morning.	It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.	Quiet today?	This morning was good.	The hat business is in trouble.	I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?	Yes.	That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.	But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.	Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.	He'll win.	Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?	This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.	You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?	Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
How did it go with the pantyhose?	It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.	Oh no!	Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
Oh, you're both so naive.	Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.	This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.	Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.	You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that?	Please don't shout.
Does everybody have to hear?	I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
Jack, I was just trying to help.	We'll make it, we'll be fine.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.	Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
Mom!	The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
I have a note.	How do you feel?	I'm excused.	Why don't you go lie down for a while.	Mom!
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.	Of course, dear. You're home now.	I'm home now.
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.	Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?	Oh. I forgot.
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.	I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
When did you start drinking coffee?	"Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it."
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?	What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.	Sort of.	What about?	The house payments.
Who was that man?	It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?	It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
Would you get that, dear?	Sure, Mom.  Hello.
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?	It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
What happened to you?	I had a dream that Grandma died.	Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.	She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?	Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.	I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.	That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.	I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?	What do you mean?	Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?	For what?	Maddy's party.	I don't feel very festive.	You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
Where have you been?	I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
I'm not the maid!	Way to go, Mom!
Would they go over my girdle or under?	Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
Isn't that awfully forward?	We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.	Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO.	What does Charlie think about that?	You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.	What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.	Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.	He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
What are you doing?	I'm just happy to see you.	Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.	I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.	Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.	Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?	Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do?
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.	Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.	Don't eat the red ones.	Why not? They're my favorite.	They're bad for you. They cause...red lips.
And the butter.	You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.	Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?
You think this'll cheer Dad up?	Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
I remember that dress.	Rosalie Testa!
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.	You have an incredible memory.
What's up?	I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.	Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.	I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.	I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.	But accidents can happen.	Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.	Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.	You're sick. You should go to the nurse. I'm going to tell Miss Dennis.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?	I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.	You look exactly the same.	I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.	Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.	He's not here. We're getting divorced.	Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.	Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.	You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.	What was?	Dancing with you.	You're a sweet man, Richard.	I guess part of us never really leaves high school.	You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.	It really wasn't that difficult.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.	I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.	It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?	All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it fourthirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
What a great kite.	I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?	I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?	Are you doing some kind of science project?	Sort of.	Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.	What's that?	That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.	"I	know what a burrito is."	Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.	What's inside?	You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes	So you think time travel is possible? For people?	Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.	Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?	Okay. I promise.	This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.	You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.	How, did you know about my grandfather?	Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.	Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?	I don't know.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.	That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.	You look pretty good for a corpse.	Come on, Richard, I'm serious.	You're giving me the creeps.	Am I dead or not?	There's one way to find out.
What're you doing?	Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.	What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.	I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!	All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.	I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow.	What if you're not here tomorrow?
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.	I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.	But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?	I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.	I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!	Richard, take it easy.	No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...	How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?	I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.	Give me some credit, will you?	Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.	Wbat're you talking about?	Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fiftyfifty.	Sixtyforty.
You're taking advantage of a minor.	When do we start?
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.	Come on. You can't be serious.	There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.	Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?	Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.	All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.	"Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous."
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?	What are you talking about?	The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.	High tech. I like the sound of that.
Hi, Richard.	What are you doing?	Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.	That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?	Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.	That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.	It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.	Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.	For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.	Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?	Like what?	Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?	What do you know about hypnosis?	Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.	Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?	No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?	Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.	Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?	Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...	What will they be made of?	I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.	Silicon is from sand.	We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?	No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.	You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?	No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.	Will you take of f your blouse?	Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.	I couldn't help it  I loved him.	One... two... three.  You are now awake.
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.	Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.	That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?	I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.	God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.	Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
What's the matter?	It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.	Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.	You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
I came to say goodbye.	Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.	You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.	So are you. You've got a vision.	Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.	Did you break up with Charlie?	Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.	Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.	No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.	Wait! I'll go with you!	You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?	I... um...
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...	"The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was ""Church"".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?"	Exactly! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.	Well... uh... thanks...
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.	My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?	Pretty much so.
I hear you moved into town.	I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
That's Renee alright.	I suppose so.
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.	There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--	--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.	How'd you know that?
I was building a doggy door.	God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
What?	I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...	Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.	Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
You took over for Doctor Yolander?	Yes... why?	Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...
Is something wrong?	Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...	Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
Out?	He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.	What do they do up there?	Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
What happened to you?	I had a little run-in with Zowie.	You sure did...
I hope he doesn't have rabies.	He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
How long ago did this guy retire?	It's been a few years.
What's wrong?!	Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?	Sure.
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...	I'll be fine, Dad.
Hey! How was your first day at school?	It sucked.
What?	You alright?
I think so.	Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.	I still can't believe she's dead...
Who was that?	Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
Hey! Where're you off to?	I'm going out, Dad!
Just out.	"""Out."" Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again..."	I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep?
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!	I'm not hungry.
What are you talking about?	I can bring her back. The same way Drew and me brought Zowie back...
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.	He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
All set?	All set.
So where're we going?	Anywhere but here.
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.	Is he gonna be okay?
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.	Just until he heals up?
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.	Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?	I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
Zowie...	Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going outside. You're grounded, buddy. That's the new law.
What's his name?	Zowie.
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.	He pissed me off.	Sorry about your mom.  I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus...
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...	You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.	Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?	Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
Is this a good spot?	I'm not burying him here...	Why not?	There's a better place...
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.	What did?	The old Indian burial ground.
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...	What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.	Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.	Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
You want me to help?	You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...	You never get over it.
It's getting pretty late. We better go.	Yeah...
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.	He was dead. You know he was.
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?	You think he'd believe it if he did?
How can he not have a heartbeat?	Maybe it takes a while...
It's weird...	What do you mean?	It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?	I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?	I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...	Dies?
I gotta go back and do my chores...	Go later...
You ever think about running away?	All the time.
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?	Right here, Mom...
How long have you been here?	Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
How did it go with your father last night?	Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...	I miss him too...
I know, Mom.	You know everything, don't you?
Mom...	I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
Are we interrupting, Andy?	In a word, Bob...	Charles is right behind me.
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.	Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?	Bailey, Brackman.
Yes!	You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
Jesus.	I don't know what to do, Bob.	You'll never find it in the dark.
What in God's name... ?	Bob...	What's wrong with your face?	What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?	Allright. Calm down.	Sorry...
What was the file name?	K-R-O-one.	Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. We'll try combinations of those letters...
Do you really think so, Andy?	Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
Why, Beckett?	Because they deserve to, Walter.
Thanks, Walter.	What's that on your forehead, pal?	Whacked with a racquetball.  I appreciate your faith in my abilities.
You're right, I probably just misfiled...	Andy?
This time. What about next time?	There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...	Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.	Really? Who thinks that, sir?
Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.	Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
Thanks, you guys.	Yeah. Thanks, guys.
Aren't you giving an exam?	I said, don't worry about it.
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.	So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
It could be parasites, an infection...	A reaction to AZT...
Don't apologize for me.	He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?	I am relaxed.
Why are you getting dressed?	You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and...  I will be back. An hour, tops.	You're going to the office?!	You're not smiling.
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?	One hour!	Drew!	I promise!
Jerk... What did you say?	"I said, ""Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."""
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?	Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.	I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.	We're not skipping this treatment.	I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.	Fuck you.	Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.	That shit's saving your life, you asshole!
What's wrong with you?	Close the law book.	I'm not going to close the--	CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!	The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.	You don't think there's much time left, do you?	That's not what I said.	You're scared. You think we're near the end.	No.	"Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? ""Begin to prepare for the inevitable."""	Maybe you should think about it.	What's that mean?!	Maybe you should think about it.	I'm not going to die.	That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.	You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?	"Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? ""Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..."" Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!"	I'm not ready to die.	Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
I'm ready...	Ready for what, baby?	Whatever.	"I hope you're ready for ""Studs,"" because that's what's on."
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.	Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
Thanks, Charles.	No sweat, buddy.
Thanks for coming in.	Of course.
I know that, Charles.	More than your friend. Family.
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.	Honesty is always best.
Take it easy, Walter.	If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?	I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.	A carrot?!
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.	Don't do this, Andy.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.	I'm seeing him this afternoon.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...	About my blood work?	We're waiting...
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.	Sounds delightful.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.	Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
"I'm trying to help your ""partner."" You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER."	He's upset, he's sorry.
Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!	Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results...
Innocuous?	Defined by Webster's as harmless.	I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. The pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! And Counselor calls it harmless?!
Client of yours?	Funny.
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?	I have AIDS.
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...	It's okay. Can I sit down?	Uh, yeah.
New baby?	One week old.	Congratulations.	Little baby girl.	Kids are great.	Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?	I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.	You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?	Correct. I'm seeking representation.	Continue.	I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?	How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?	Nine.	Continue.	I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.	We?	My lover and I.	Your... lover?	Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.	Continue.	I dove back into work, everything was fine. Until the lesions started...
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?	Makeup.
Big trouble.	Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
I buy that.	As in, the vegetable?
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...	Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?	Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today.
Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.	They sabotaged me.	I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.	Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...	Correct. I don't.
Thanks for your time.	Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.	Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm not dead yet.
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?	Fine.
Who'd you get?	What?	Find a lawyer?	I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?	Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.	What's her name?	Rayisha.	Rayisha. Very nice.
How did they find out?	One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.	They didn't fire her?	No. They didn't fire her.
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.	Thank you.
There is no relevant precedent.	Arline decision. Supreme Court.	Arline?
One more thing, Your Honor...	Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
PARRTYY!	We're friends of Beckett's.	It's me, you dork.
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...	I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
I'm a law suit.	Not bad.	Get it?	Let's find you a drink.
What do you want?	Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.	Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?	Sure. It's fine.	No, we have to do it. But later, allright?	Thank you.
You think I'm uncomfortable...	Correct.	You're right.
You survived your first gay party intact.	Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.	Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.	Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.	Uh huh...	Beckett?	Charles. Okay. Miller?	What?	Do you... pray?
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...	What have you prayed for?	For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.	There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.	I've considered that.	What happens?	We proceed, representing your estate.	I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...	I know a good probate lawyer.	Thanks.  Do you like opera?
Opera?	Want to hear my favorite aria?	Opera?
I'll look over the Q and A.	You're ready, don't worry.
Particularly, Charles.	What impressed you about him?	He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.	What kind of person is that?	Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.	It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.	You didn't look then, the way you look now?
A regular all-American guy?	I suppose you could say that.	Except... you were gay?	I still am.	In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?	No. I didn't.	Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?	You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
Are you a good lawyer?	I'm an excellent lawyer.	What makes you an excellent lawyer?	I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.	What do you love about it?	Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?	Yes. On my torso.	If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an <u>accurate</u> idea of what we're talking about.
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?	Yes.	Thank you.
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?	What?	A good start.
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.	It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.	Sure thing.
Thanks for coming by.	You bet. We'll see you later.
Rach.	I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.	Catch me later, I'll be here. And tell Amy, I love her painting, it's on my wall.
I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.	Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.	What can I do?	Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
"You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had ""an adventurous spirit."" Is that correct?"	Something like that.	Do you take risks?	In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.	In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?	Not unnecessary ones.	Have you ever been to the Apollo Cinema on Sansom Street?
What kind of movies do they show there?	Gay movies.	Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?	Yes.	Do men have sex with each other in that theater?	Yes.
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?	I guess it was 1984, 85.	Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?	It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.	But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?	That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.	You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?	I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
Do you need a break?	No.	While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?	That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.	Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?	No.	Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
Some do. I didn't.	As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?	In some situations.	Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
Yes.	You could have infected him, isn't that right?	Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.	Really?	Yes.
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?	That's right.	And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.	Absolutely.	Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?	One. Here, in front of my ear.
By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...	Answer the question, please.	No. I can't really see it.	Thank you.
Hello?	Hi, Mom. It's me.
Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?	I'm fine.	What's Dr. Gillman say?	Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ...  Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns.  My platelets look good too.	Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold.
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?	Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.	Where's Dad?	He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
Mom?	All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.	Thanks, Mom... Dad?
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.	Objection.
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?	Yes.	Were you recently promoted?	Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.	Thank you.
Ms. Burton. You're black.	Is that a question?	No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?	Yes.
In what way?	Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.	Your earrings?
"Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... ""ethnic"" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more ""American."""	What did you say?	I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.	Thank you. No more questions.
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.	Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
Objection!	I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
Objection!	I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
Objection!	I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.	Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.	I'm not worried. What are you doing?
The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.	Right.
Leave that.	"Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: ""whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?"
We're going to draw blood.	Why are we going to do that?	Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.	You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?	Right.	It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?	Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...	Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.
A homosexual encounter.	Get real.	Unprotected sex with a prostitute.	Uh.... No. Not really.	Or unprotected sex with someone you didn't know very well, any time during the last twelve years.
Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?	Wyant Wheeler represented us.
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.	That's correct.	Were you pleased with his work?	We were satisfied.
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?	That's correct.	"According to the deposition, you said you were ""thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed"" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?"	I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?	We won.	Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?	It satisfied me.
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?	I might.	Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.	Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.	You're in trouble.
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.	In a word, yes.	We don't think it's fair to keep you here, where your future is limited. But we wish you luck, Andy, all the luck in the world.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...	But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...	... we've got a committee meeting.
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?	Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.	What kind of people?	People who want to bend the rules...
Good school. What year?	Second.	Great.	Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?	Aren't you?	What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?	Do I look gay to you? Relax.	Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!	Take it as a compliment. Geesh.
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?	Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.	You're the asshole, buddy.	Get a life.
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!	Give me the camera, Joe.
You have a problem with gays, Joe.	Not especially.
How many gays do you know?	How many do you know?	Lots.	Who?	Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?	Duh...	Since when?	Probably since she was born.	Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.	Okay, Joe...	"I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? ""Is that mine? I thought it was yours."" Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is."	Fine, Joe.	And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.	That's perfectly clear.	"Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking: ""I hope this guy doesn't touch me. I don't even want him to <u>breathe</u> on me?"""
Don't know, Joe.	Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!	Have you changed your aftershave?	Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
Joe?	Yeah... ?	Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?	Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?	Great, Lisa. Thank you.
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?	My lettuce is wilting.
I'll see you in an hour, max.	Night, honey.
Right.	Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?	Why should I?
Yeah. Do I have a case?	Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?	Now that you mention it...	Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?	A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.	Any women on board?
Not when I was in the Navy.	So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?	Going on... like...?	Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
Yeah. But we took care of him.	How did you do that?	We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.
You taught him a lesson.	Yes, we did.	Like firing Andrew Beckett taught <u>him</u> a lesson?
<u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.	So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?	I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.	But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?	I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.
Attorney for the plaintiff?	Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.	"I've seen your television commercials. ""If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, ""through the <u>negligence</u> of others."""	I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.	On behalf of the defendants?
If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter.	By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?	Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...	Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.	Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.	With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?	No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
Let's continue.	"You had one guy ""like that?"""
This would be a good time to break for the day...	Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?	Beckett?
It's good to be King, hey Charles?	Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?	Helloooo...
Julius!	Dr. J.!
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.	We ought to be suing him.
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?	Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
You'll be sorry, Beckett.	Andy, you don't want this.
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.	You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?	Jesus.	What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?	Charles...	What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!	Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.	"Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, ""I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"""	He was doing a great job.	"Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say ""I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?"" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God."
I've discovered something interesting, Charles.	... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?	No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.	Charles...	If you feel differently, Bob, you should say so, when you're called to the stand. After all, this isn't a conspiracy.
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...	... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...	... But we shouldn't have fired him...	... It's time to get this society back on track!
Don't wanna miss this.	Lookit. Lookit!
Gonna lose everybody out here....	He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
What? What is it?	It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT!
You came for us....	Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
Probably okay to talk to me now.	Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?	Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....	<u>What</u>?
Tell me that was you.	Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?	Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
Oh, Lord....	It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
You mean...tonight? With all those things still out there?	Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.	Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
Bottle-count.	Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....	No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
Bring the light!	What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --	Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.	Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.	'Mean the whispers?	What whispers?	The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.	Show me your eyes.
You did this? To yourself?	"Slam doctor. Well, we called him ""doctor."""	Heard about it. Just never seen it.	Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.	Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.	Look deeper.
Power cells.	They're coming.	Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.	I got the quick-and-ugly version.	An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?	Entered our minds.	I asked what <u>you</u> thought.	You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
Why, what'd you hear?	Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --	Had it with deals.	But I just wanted to say --	Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.	We can, can't we? Trust you?	Actually...  That's what I been askin' myself.
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?	Saw something I didn't like.
What do you see? Riddick?	Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
Riddick? What the hell are you --	<u>Listen</u>.
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.	Think about what?
What about her?	What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
Back to the ship, huh?	Get out of our way.	So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? Until you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan?
How many you see?	One or two.	Audrey?
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.	Let's drop back an' boot up.
As fast as you can.	You sure you can keep --	As fast as you can.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!	Riddick? How close?
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!	We can't make it.
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.	You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..	Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.	What, you're afraid?	Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.	<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.	Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
Just come with me!	Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
They're already dead. Get on board.	You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.	'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.	No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
Step aboard, Carolyn.	I can't....I can't....	Here. Make it easy on you.	Don't do this to me....	Just give me your hand.	But they...they could still be....	No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
You'd die for them?	I would try for them.	You barely know them.	But I'm human. I know you view that as a weakness, but I'm sorry -- I <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes. I would die for them.
This is it? Booze? <u>That's</u> what you have to drink?	"200-year-old single-malt scotch is to ""booze"" as foie gras is to ""duck guts."""
What do my eyes see?	It's starting....
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.	Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
Christ, you don't know what's out there!	I know what's in here!
There....	Like the light is scalding it.	It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...I <u>think</u> two more....	Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns well.	How many bottles?	Not sure. Ten?	Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they burn?  If you got a receipt?	Possibly.	Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.	We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.	Can we switch?	What, switch what?	I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
Hey.	Hey, who?	Hey, me. Over here.
Amazing. I'm Johns.	Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
And him?	Big Evil?	We just keep him locked up forever?	Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --	I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?	Only around humans.
S'matter?	Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
A very good sign.  That's Riddick's direction. You do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.	Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.	Which means he went toward sunrise.
What?	Tell me it's not a mirage.
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.	Probably right.
No, no, I wanted to get away.	"So I noticed. Never seen a ""captain"" quite so ready to leave her ship."
Better keep moving....	What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.	Promise me. Swear to me you won't --	You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.	During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
So now you know.	Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
Didn't bite.	What?	Thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. So I left the bottle out as bait.
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --	Shut up.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.	Like what?	Like my pistola.
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....	Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
He used that?	Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.	So why isn't it all bloody?	I assume he licked it clean.
I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --	Let's just be sure.	I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --	<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.	Well, don't ask me to.	Thought you didn't believe his story.	I don't. But that ground looked none too stable, and I don't want anyone --
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?	Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.	What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?	You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.	Thanks for the tip, Johns.
Little ratty-ass.	Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.	How many?	15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.	25 kilos each, huh?
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --	So what happened? Where are they, then?
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --	60 years ago.	Wha'?
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --	Let's wait on the power cells.	Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --	We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --	<u>Get the fucking cells over here</u>, Johns. What's the discussion?
He can pilot?	Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.	Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --	He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.	That's what I said.
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.	May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --	You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.	-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --	He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
Dancin' on razor blades here...	I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --	I never said I was.	Never said you were a hype, either.
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?	And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?	Not a problem unless you're gonna make --	<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.	Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.	Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.	You coulda helped. And you didn't.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!	'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.	We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?	Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.	Smoke screen for what?	For your own fear.	Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
How much you weigh, Johns?	What the hell's it matter?	How much?	79 kilos.	Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?	We're just burnin' light here.	You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.	I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
So you noticed too?	Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
We aren't completely stupid.	Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?	I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.	I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.	Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --	No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get --
This does not help us, Johns.	-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --	Just shut up, okay?	-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.	Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
We cannot go through there....	How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --	So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?	Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
Well? Is it just the pump?	Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.	What, you're goin' off, too?	Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.
Why did I fall on you?	He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --	I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?	You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.	Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.	Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
Fry?	Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....	"You mean that ""load"" of passengers?"	So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --	Company's not here, is it?	When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --	And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
Owens!	70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
I don't suppose....	One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....	You know who Muhammad was?	Some prophet guy?	"""Some prophet guy."" And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God."	You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?	Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.	Frightening thought.	We're all on the same hajj now.
One is all?	For now.
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.	Quiet, please. Everyone.
Hasan?	Riddick?
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.	And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?	No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
Imam. Slow down.	What?	Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.	I would rather we all stay--	Do what I say. Please.
The sled as a shield....	And what about the cells?
Oh, no. No, no, no....	Rain.
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?	Has anyone checked the coring room?
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --	"There is no ""safe."""
Where's Mr. Johns?	Which half?	You mean....
What're you doin'?	Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.	And pointless.	I see. Well, even if you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --	You <u>don't</u> see.
'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.	He will be with us. Nonetheless.	Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare.
Suleiman!	Get the girl back under. Keep going.	SULEIMAN!	KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
New Mecca....	Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?	It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?	All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
"""God is Great,"" yes?"	I'm born-again.
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....	The child heard you before any of us could even....
I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.	Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.	Please...this solves nothing...please....
We crossed our own tracks.	He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
She's the captain, we should listen to --	Listen to her? <u>Her</u>? When she was willing to sacrifice us all?
...then we saw this.	Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
King Tut's tomb....	Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.
A toast to whatever he just said.	I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
What the hell are these?	Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.	Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.	Like an emergency life-raft, right?
Very big beads.	Not staying in here another....
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.	Oh, so I'm disposable?
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?	We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.	Say that again.	Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....	For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?	Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
You'd cut me loose, Boss?	Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.	If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
Are you fuckin' kidding me?	Not afraid of the dark, are you?
I'd rather piss glass.	Well, you got the big gauge.	Wanna rag your fat mouth?
Think about that reward, Johns.	I'm willing to take a cut in pay.	How 'bout a cut in your gut?
"<u>Fuck me</u>. You said ""clear."""	"Said ""looks clear."""	Well, what's it look like now?	Looks clear.
Such as.	Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!	About the girl.
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.	No. She's not.
Aw, this can't be happening to me....	They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
Ain't all of us gonna make it.	Just realized that, huh?
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?	Not if I'm the one.	What if you're one of five?
"Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called ""triage,"" okay?"	"Kept calling it ""murder"" when I did it."	Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.	Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.	<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.	Nice embellishment.	Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.	So which one caught your eye?	Don' look, don' look, don' look....
What's her name, anyway?	What do you care?
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.	What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?	What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?	Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.	Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.	Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
An' this?	Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.	'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.	Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
So much for your nightfall.	So much for my cocktail hour.
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.	Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
Not a star-jumper.	Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?	Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.	I know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
You were tryin' to kill him too.	Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
Take it.	What, it's broken?	Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.	Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
Dr. Zaius --	Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?	Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.	You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?	Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.	Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
How did you know we'd come here?	It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.	We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.	I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...	Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.	I apologize.	To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.	Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'	No sir, I haven't forgotten.	"Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.	Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape."
Seal the cave?	That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.	Do you have any weapons?	The best. But we won't need them.	Just the same, I want one.
As you wish.	Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.	You still don't believe me, do you?	It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.	Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.	I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
Where does the river lead?	It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.	No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?	Right now, if you like.
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.	Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.	Shut up.
Taylor, I'd rather you -	No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.	What are you doing there?	Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.	And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.	Good luck then.
Do you have to work tonight?	No.	Neither do I.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.	What's so special about him?	Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
Look -- she remembers.	Remembers what?	The blood transfusion.	Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.	Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?	Where did you learn to do this?
Now, just a minute --	Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.	And they fell out of the sky with you?
Flight is a scientific impossibility.	And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?	No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
'Then how do you account for me?,	I don't. And I'm not going to try.	But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.	Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?	Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.	No, they won't -
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -	It's probably wrong --	-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -	The evidence was very meager --	You didn't think so then.	That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.	How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
'I am not a missing link.'	Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.	Well, maybe they're not.	No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.	Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!	Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.	Zira....
How did it go?	There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.	Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
Got your sensors?	Yo!	Geiger counter?	Yo!	One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.	But how long is a day?	Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.	Any sign of dangerous ionization?	No.	Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
Which direction?	That way.	Any particular reason?	None at all.
Taylor -- quit riding him.	You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.	Let's find them all.
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.	Blessed are the vegetarians.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?	Him.
Will he live?	I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
This place is dirty, doctor.	These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?	What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.	You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.	That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.	Hmph.	The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.	They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.	Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.	Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith	Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.	Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.	Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.	Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.	Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Objection!	Sustained.
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.	Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?	I admit, I know nothing of your culture.	Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.	Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.	Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?	Show this to the President.
Good morning, Dr. Zira.	Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?	No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.	Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?	See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Did you see that? It's remarkable!	Huh?	He's trying to form words.	Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
What happened?	Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?	I'll see.
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.	He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.	Do as I say.
Landon! Send a last signal.	What signal?	To Earth! That we've landed!
It's no use ... there she goes.	Forget it. Abandon ship.
Gone.	We're here to stay.
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?	We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
Landon! Join the expedition.	Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?	Air leak. Died in her sleep.	You don't seem very cut up about it.	It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.	Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.	By our time.  You've turned gray.
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?	long pause) You know it.	Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.	Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.	It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
If only we could get a fix.	What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
All right --	There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.	I'm prepared to die.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing	Climb off me, will you!	And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.	"Taylor.	I'm telling you --"	Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?	Don't bother	Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.	But I'm not prepared to die.	I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
Scarecrows?	Let's take a look.
Can we take a dip?	Okay.
No cigar.	Try telling them our names.
We got off at the wrong stop.	You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
Who are you?	So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --	Come on. Get me out of here.
She comes along too.	Zira doesn't want your female.	I want her.	If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --	Fine. Just let her out.
Shouldn't we be moving on?	I'm for that.
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?	In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.	Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.	Relax. You'll see it all later.
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?	Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --	All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.	What is it?	I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.	Yes, I can do that.
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?	I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
Lucius.	I think you're making a mistake.	That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.	What?	The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed.  Don't try to follow us.  I'm pretty handy with things like this.
I told you not to bring the other one.	He wouldn't leave her.	All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
Gorilla hunters ...	Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
Who put them up?	The Hunt Club.	To scare off humans?
What is that?	A man, Dr. Maximus.	I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.	Why special?	We're -- conducting a new experiment.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.	My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.	And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.	At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.	My name is Taylor.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.	This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...	Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
One is in a museum!	Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!	Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.	By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.	Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
ThatÕs a lie!	Mind your tongue, madame.	Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.	Read it yourself.	"'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."""	Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
This is a joke in very poor taste.	Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
How so?	Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
Sustained.	Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?	With one of them.	Identify him, then. Speak to him.
What about me?	Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?	No.	Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.	I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.	You lied. Where is your tribe?	My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.	Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?	What about it?	A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?	I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.	"Certainly not.	You're a mutant."	That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.	Of course.	All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?	Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --	Then you admit --	I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?	Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?	You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?	I don't know.	If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.	I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?	You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!
Stop right there.	Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.	All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
What is your proposal?	When were the Sacred Scrolls written?	Twelve hundred years ago.	Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?	Of course.	Okay.Up to the cave.
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.	That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
Tell him to pull back!	Cease fire! Withdraw!
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?	He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
Then there is another jungle?	Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.	"Sure.	In a cage."	Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?	No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?	Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.	What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.	The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.	We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.	Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?	Listen, listen -- I can speak --
"Speak! Go on.	Speak again."	My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!	There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?	Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering you!
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?	Shhhh!	What is this?	A hearing.
It's him...Landon.	Which one?	Second from the left.
You! ... You knew about this?	No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.	You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
Listen-	Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.	You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Are you going to take her with you?	Yes.	Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.	Maybe not.	You want her that much?	You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?	She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.	Taylor, please --	Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
Taylor! Tell him.	He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.	Taylor, you can't.
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.	Why not?	It's humiliating.	Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
Would you like to come along?	We can't.	It's better than going to prison for heresy.
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.	All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.	God bless you.
He's moving his fingers!	Of course. He saw you moving yours.	But perhaps he understood --
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?	Yes, Sir.
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.	I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.	Do you believe him?	Like you, I find it difficult.	But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.	This is his assertion.	Where are they now?
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?	He doesn't know.	Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.	Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?	But there's the doll, sir.	What?
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?	He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
But the proof? The doll?	In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
Bunker...	Where?
...but 'Lias is still out there.	I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor  NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!
Elias is dead. Join up with the platoon. Move it.	He's dead! Where?... You saw him?	Yeah. Back about 100 metres. He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place.

Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad.  We move out in two-zero mikes.	I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.	How the hell did he get away?	Fuckers returned fire soon as we lit 'em up. Hard core fuckin' NVA. They got their shit together.
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!	Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.	YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!

Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.	Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?	Don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'Lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. Out here you belong to me. Now move.
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here.	Yeah, they had claymores strung up in the trees, blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces. BAAD SHIT.

Barnes got it in for you, don't he?	Barnes believes in what he's doing.	And you, do you believe?	In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...	You really think so... us?
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...	Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?	Yeah, those are the guys that live. I really don't think Death gives a shit, it's like a giant garbage can, I think it takes whatever it can get... you never know where it's gonna come from anyway... so why spin your wheels?

Okay - got light duty, three days.	Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.	What you got there - beers?	Yeah, just stole me some from the Top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway.  Chucks are coming. You better 'didi' man.

'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'	Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?	Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?	Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.	Does a chicken have lips? Whoever said we did, babe. Make it outta here, it's all gravy, every day of the rest of your life man - gravy. Oh shit, superlifer!
Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!	I gotta didi man.

You volunteered for this shit man?	You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
What we got here a crusader?	Sounds like it.
Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.	They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.	So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!	Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.	Fuck you Elias.
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.	Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.	They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.	Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!	What are you talking about!	You know what I'm talking about!	No I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias!
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.	Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?	This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...
Merle?	Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
Whew! - where that come from?	Found it. Growing in a garden.	Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.	Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...	...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.	Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.	So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.	He dugged his own grave.
Right on.	I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.	If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
I didn't like it.	Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.	Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.	That's what he is... Baaaa!
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...	Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
You wanted to see me sir?	Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.	Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir.	These two holes are yours...	Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...	I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.	Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...	I don't want to hear about it Jackson.	You don't want to hear about it?	That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.	Right...	This is one time we could sure use Elias.
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.	My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.	I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.	How far does this train go?	Vancouver, B.C.	I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.	Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.	Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.	Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation?	I'll make one for you.  I live there.	Well..	A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?	I really don't know.	Indefinitely?	I don't know.	You don't know.
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.	Very nice Mitchell turns.	No thanks?	Thank you.	Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?	I'm supposing.	I think you're a nice girl. I like you. But I can read signs if the print is large enough. It was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector.  A sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.
I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.	Yes?	How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.		Don't get me wrong, Betty. I'm not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know.
Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.	Not tonight.	What's the matter?	I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.	We have some nice places around Vancouver.	I'm sure you have.	Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.	I haven't been invited.	Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.	Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.	Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
The brush-off, huh?	I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
Don't I even get my face slapped?	Would you mind?	Okay. You win.	If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.	If I change my mind.
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.	How do you do?
I think I'd like to dance.	Why certainly, baby.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.	How careful should I be?	I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.	Maybe you're going to have to like me.
I think you're drunk.	Just drunk enough.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?	Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
Good evening, Miss.	How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?	I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.	How long would that take?	Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...	Immigration Officer?	Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...
They might think I was running away from something.	Possibly, Miss.
Good morning. Can I do something for you?	I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?	I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.	Bank?	Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.	I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.	No, please.	Sit down then. We often have a double up here.	I see.
Your liquor laws..	Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.	I see.	It might be worth a Martini to you.	I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.	It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.	What did you say his name was?	Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.	You don't sound as if you liked him very much.	No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..	As I said before...	Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before, wouldn't you?
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.	I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.	And do you amuse the guests?	No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?	You're drinking it.	I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.	Would it make you anymore amusing?	Whatever you say.	I didn't say anything.	I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.	I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.	Do you think I don't?	Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.	You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?	He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.
Dance?	No thank you.
I know it's a littler late for an apology.	Much too late.	Don't take it so big... it isn't a tragedy.
You said it wasn't a tragedy.	What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.	There's one less tonight.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.	He got in here how?	Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything.
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?	Sure... but somebody always does..
They'll know whether he killed himself.	I don't.	How did you meet him?	On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.	Nice of him.	He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.	He was a great boy for that. What else?	That's all there is.
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.	I'd rather wait until it does matter.
You tried to run away.	There wasn't any plane.	It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
Want a spike in it?	No thanks.
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.	You didn't have to tell him that.
Bad?	Bad enough.	He could hardly help suspecting you.	That's putting it mildly.
What time is it?	Quarter after one. Why?	There's a lot of night left to live through.	So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.	Dance? Tonight?	Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.	Certainly not to me.	Just who are you, anyway?	You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.	I'm different. I like it fine.
Cold?	Is this the best you can do?	At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.
Want to dance?	Dance? Here?	Why not?	They know you here--know your name.	I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it.
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.	I didn't notice him.	We walked right passed him. He's following us.	Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.	Then he's got to be a detective.	Couldn't be.	Then he's--
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?	Absolutely sure.	We'll find out.
He's a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.	You don't know who he is?	He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.	He was following us--but he's not a policeman.	Us?	All right--following me.	Why?	No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.	Anything I can do about it?	Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?	Try not talking.
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?	Nothing matters.	No use waiting, then.
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.	So have I.	From you, I like it.
It sounds like a fair location. Could you be a little more exact?	I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--	I don't think that's on the market anymore.  I'd like something much closer to the water.
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?	There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.	You're probably mistaken about that.  Let's get together sand talk it over.  There's always a solution to these problems.  But it must be near the water.  Quite near--  Yes, if you don't mind waiting.
I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.	No percentage in that.	They're going to arrest me.	I know.  Killaine has a warrant.	I have my own warrant.  Stop a minute, please.
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?	Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.	There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.	That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?	How bad is it?  Bad enough for--	Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.	How bad is the other thing?  The secret?	I was tried for murdering my husband.  Guilty.  The judge set the verdict aside.  There was one man on the jury--  --but he was afraid.  They were all afraid--of my father-in-law. That man followed me last night-- he came from him of course.  My father-in-law will never give up. Never.  He promised me that.  So I came to Vancouver, B.C. As far away as I can get from North Carolina.  And it happens all over again.  Almost the same thing. Almost the same way.  Do you wonder about this--
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere?	They'll look for you.	I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.	And Betty Mayfield--	Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.	But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?	If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.	Killaine...	The best interference runner we've got.  He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman.  Come here, baby.
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.	This must have cost a fortune.	It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.	Do you have to leave the note?	It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.	You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.	My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.
Well?	You leave it.
Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when.	Killaine's wise to what?
See anything?	I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.	There would be a moon tonight.
Cold?	Frozen.	Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now.
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.	Wonder what?	If you're doing all this just for me.	That, and the fun of it.	I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.	That's right.
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.	Including Killaine.	Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.	I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.	Larry Mitchell found out.  So you killed him.
In a way.	If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.	So could you.  But our records were a little against us.	What your father did doesn't condemn you.	Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?	The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
It buys things, just like any other kind.	That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?	No.  I paid him off.	He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.	Not this one.  And not Mitchell.	You-killed-him?	Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.	I guess I'm a little screwy.  Maybe I could believe it.  Should I try?	Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.	So that I will never be found.
You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.	I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.	And I'm begging for my life--and yours.	Mine?	Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.	Mitchell was dead enough.	And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.	Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?	Magruder does.	You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?	But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.	Would I want to?	Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--	Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I have to kill both of us--
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.	If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.	Me?	Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
I think you mean that.	Do you think I was faking?	If I did-I don't-now.
Yes, Miss.	I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.	Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.	Beer?  Well, all right.	Beer or ale, Miss?	Ale. I don't mind.	Right, Miss.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.	I don't know her.. or particularly want to.	You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.	I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.	I'll have to know a little more than that.	I'm sorry, that's all there is.	Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
Please answer my question.	You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.	That's an evasion and you know it.	It is?
Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?	Who told you I was married?	There's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?	Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.	I'm sorry.	Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.	Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
What this?	Yes.	Where's you get it?	A graduation present.
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.	Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.	I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.	They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.	Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.	You must come from pretty far South.
FLorida?	I've never been to Florida.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.	We wouldn't have met at all.	True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.	You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.	You've had dealings with the police before?	Who hasn't--one way or another?	But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.	Is it a crime?	We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?	You were there when I last saw him.	I'd like to believe that. It's not too easy.
I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.	The police always do, don't they?	You've has an experience that you don't want to talk about. An unhappy marriage, for example.
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?	You--or the Vancouver Police Department?	We try to be decent.	You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?	Nobody can help me. You, least of all.	If I understand what you meant by that.	You understand perfectly.	Then there isn't much I can do, is there?	There isn't anything you can do.
This isn't a very good place to talk.	I don't want to talk.	I've come here to arrest you for murder.
I expected nothing else.	I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.	You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.	There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
"I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, ""There goes my lost love""-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl."	Points very straight to her.	He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--	What does he see?	Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?	Very ridiculous.	That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.	What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?	They call me Jeff.	Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?	Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.	Looking for peanuts, I suppose.	So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.	I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.	Time's up.  I'm off the case.	They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.	That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.	Because you think your in love with me?	I'm enough of a copper to do my duty.  My boss made it tough for me.  If I don't arrest you, I've gone soft.  If I do, it's to save my face.  I don't play those rules.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.	To do what?	I can't answer that.	What will they do to you?	That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?	You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.	I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.	What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.	I know that.	But even if you were in love with me.	There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.	You do things the hard way, don't you?	Sometimes.	Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.	Goodbye, Betty.
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.	We know everything.	No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.	I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.	I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.	Morning. Any calls?	Mr. Reed would like you to call him.	All right. Get him.	And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.	Who's Goble?
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.	This way.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.	I'm not interested in blind dates.
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.	You asked for it.	I'm still asking. What do you want?	I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.	Name it.	Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
Private eye?	You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.	What are your rates?	$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.	What have you got on Miss Mayfield?	Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?	Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.	I don't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat--or call the police--or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose.
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.	If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.	Bluff. You've waited too long.	For five hundred, what do I get?	I go home and paint the kitchen.	For two hundred?	I stick around and wait for the five hundred.	You mentioned information.	Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.	A thousand.	Got it on you?	Got the information on you?	Get it in half an hour.
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night	Why not here?	I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.	Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?	In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.	Fascinated.
What'll you have, Margo?	Martini.	You, Killaine?
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?	Sometimes.	And without much discrimination.	Leave that one lay.	They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?	Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.	That comedian?
All right, let's see the buzzer.	What's a buzzer?	So you're not a cop.	Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?	Who told you my name?	I've got good ears.
How are your teeth getting along?	The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
What's this in favor of?	I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
What?	A private joke.
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.	You're not English.
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.	How's life treating you?	The usual grind.	Round of golf Saturday?	If I can get off.
Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?	Hardly. Who's the girl?	Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.	She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.	That's what I thought, at first.  Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party.  With my liquor of course.
Thank you.	Yes, I've seen it before.
Where?	On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.	Quite sure you had no motive?
Could be.	I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?	No.
It was lying where on the balcony?	Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.	We do, when we get the chance.
How about a cup of coffee?	No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
How are you two getting along?	Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
In case you want to have us followed.	I don't.	Well--good night.
Time for a little chat?	If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?	Thanks.  I don't mind.
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?	I never notice the view after the first week.	I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?	I wouldn't know.	"""Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others."" Very appealing, especially to a poor man."	Could we discuss that some other time?	Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?	A couple of hours.	I have a warrant for her arrest.	That must hurt.	I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--	Would that make me a heel?	You'd be breaking the law.	Doesn't answer the question.	The only answer I have for you.	You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?	Information.	Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.	It could have been an accident.	That COULD BE TOLD.	Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.	Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.	Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.	How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?	She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
Mitchell was too drunk.	Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.	Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.	You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?	No idea.
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.	Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.	I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.	Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?	Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.	I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.	I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.	Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
I had a father who knew how to steal.	What?	You asked me where it all came from.	Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?	The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?	Lay off, can't you?	Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.	Did I do something wrong?	I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.	How would you know, Brandon?	Want to walk out... or get thrown out?	You don't throw guests out, Brandon.	Don't bet on it. I'm eccentric.
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.	Mr. Mitchell.	A little something on account perhaps?	Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.	I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.	Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.	I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.	Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
What are you doing here?	I don't think you locked your door.	What do you want?	See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.	Passkey?	"Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say ""Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another""?  They always have another."	Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.	And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.	You nasty, sardonic--	Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.	That's not enough.	I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.	He saw my face too.	So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.	They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.	Convenient, isn't it?
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.	How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.	You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?	With what motive?	Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.	He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?	I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..	Recently, then.	No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.	Thank you.
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.	Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.	Floater?	Not a floater.  Only just dead.	You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.	You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.	Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.	I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.	Let me know when you've identified him
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't	I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
Got a moment, Inspector?	I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.	You told me when we'd identified this fellow--
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.	Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.	If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--	I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.	I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.	I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police.	Send that?	Would you?	If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.	How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.	Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?	Men like you don't need orders.
What's the face for, Driscoll?	Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.	We don't need him.
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.	The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.	Go live in a tent.	It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.	Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?	One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.	What do I get for it?	You get it's brother.	Sounds like a fair swap.  Let's take a look.
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.	Open it and count it.	When you sign for it, you count it.  It's your dough.
You in charge here?	So it seems Sergeant.	Right.	"I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as ""Inspector"". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me ""sir""."
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.	They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.	I've met her.	It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.	Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.	So the shell ought to have gone over?	Unless the gun was slanted up.	So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.	Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.	I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?	I'll know when I find it.	I guess I'm just ballast around here.
"""G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."""	Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.	Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.	Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
Not too hard, is it?	Maybe we've been pretty dumb--	There wasn't any motive...let's try out the act.
Was that about the right angle?	I think so.	Where's the shell?	Should be over there.
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?	If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.	They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?	Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.	Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.	Such as?	Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?	Do I know who lives down there?	You can find out.	Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?	You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.	Pretty big chance, huh?	You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
This is the shell.  What about the gun?	Well.  What about it?	I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.	So?	I've got to find a way to handle it, openly.  Like Brandon.
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.	He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.	And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.	If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.	No suicide.	Did we ever really think it was suicide?	You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.	And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.	A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?	I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
May you what?	Oh nothing.	Are you always this witty?
Scotch and plain water, I think.	Warm water, no doubt.
I never saw it before.	Positive?
What about me?	Not quiet yet.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?	I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?	I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?	Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.	Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?	I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.	Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?	How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.	Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.	It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.	Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.	I am a fool.	That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?	Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!	You didn't play it for laughs last night.	Did you ever have a serious operation?	Mortar shells are not funny, either.	At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?	Not if it clears the air.	It does.  May I go now?	I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--	I don't understand.	Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.	Now, you're being beastly.	Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.	And if you didn't believe me?	You would still have planted information that Clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  Very neat.  Good morning, Mrs. West.
Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.	I'm interested in who handled it.	Four different people, Inspector. Three men and a women.  I've made slides for two.  They handled both envelopes.
No doubt about that one.	How about Magruder?	He checks too.	That leaves two strangers.	So far.	Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.	Mayfield?  She fit into this?	She might.
You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.	I'll take your word.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?	The card says so, doesn't it?	Brandon handled the money envelope.
Killaine, this is Mr. Mitchell, Senior.  Young Mitchell's father. He just flew in from Toronto.	How do you do, sir.
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?	She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.	She's the only one who had a dead man in her room.  The only one who won't give an account of herself. The only one who tried to run away. And the only one, so far, I've been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes.  What more do you want?
No.	I hear she's a very pretty girl.	Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.	Aye.  You have a point there.
Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?	When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?	A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.	It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?	I don't know, sir.	Well, find out.  Who's covering her?	Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.	I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.	Ye have, have ye?	We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.	And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?	Yes, sir.

I believe you won decorations during the war.	Two.
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.	Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.	You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.	Not too far, I hope.	This badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk.  It is not a thing you can give up as of no value.  It may be taken from you--and you may die defending it. But you'll not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with.  It's a naked steel of the sword of Justice.  Put it back in your pocket and hold tight to it--and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now.
Get out of here!	What are my orders, sir?	You think I'm wrong about this bit of a girl.  Go out and prove it against me!
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.	With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?	So-so.	Who's the girl?	Her name's Mayfield. Betty Mayfield.	Nice.	She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?	Why should I mind?	You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.	As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.	Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.	She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.	Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?	You ought to know why.	I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.	Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.	You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?	I have a rough idea.	You'd go to jail. For a long term.	Correct. I couldn't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.
What'll we do about it, Margo?	She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.	You don't have to make a pose of it.	It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.	I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.	That's not very kind.	Kind or not kind. What's the difference? It always ends up the same way.
What's this?	What does it look like?	How long have you had it?	Years, why?	It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.	You already have the checks, darling.	I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.	Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?	Of course.	How about your new friend?	I told you she's just..	A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?	Right.	In an hour, Larry.
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.	It's quite unimportant, Mr. Mitchell. After all, you got what you wanted.	Be nasty.	I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.	In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there.
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.	I say YES!
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.	Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.	It's kind of you to see me.	Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden.  And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'.
He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?	He was delightful.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.	What a shame.	It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.	Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--	I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?	Yes.	Good.  Suez was a minefield for both parties.
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?	It's fine, thank you.	Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?	Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.	And I'd like you to call me Ann.
To Ann.	To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.	History books are first onto the bonfires.	If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pâté.	Thanks.
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.	If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.	You're kind to be so encouraging.	I think you'll do very well.
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.	Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.	It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.	Yes.	She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.	Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.	Don't be silly.  I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.
Thank you.	We'll see you next week, and if--
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.	I will, thanks.	These are transcripts of various radio broadcasts, including Gaitskill's, the one they tried to stop.  You ought to have that ...
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.	Well, we were just...
Shall we go?	Yes.
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now  the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.	Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?	Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.	What went wrong?	Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.
Thank you.	Sit on that log, dear.
Now first of all, tell us your name.	Penfield.  James Penfield.	This is Jill, Carol, Betty, Mandy, Louise, Pete over there, and I'm Carmen.
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.	That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.	Very good.
Terrific.	But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?	I'll suggest it.  Remember though, we're news, not features.  It might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police.  Anyway, I'll be back with this soon. Thanks.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?	Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?	Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?	I'm not sure I can face it.	Keep me company.
How's Mary?	She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.	No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?	Look, I'd rather you didn't ask me questions.  I can't talk about it.
Aha.  James giving some woman the old heave-ho.	Exactly that.
It's terribly good.	Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
Committed to memory.  Forever.	I see.
Attributed?	Of course.	Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?	It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
Congratulations.  Who with?	A glamorous young lady way above his station...
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.	Hello.	I won't introduce you all by name. Basically James, this is our UK sales team.  What was I saying? Yes, these graduate trainees...
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.	No thanks.  I'd like to break away--	I'll have some of that.	...break away completely from--	And some of that.  Sorry.	...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
Yes...You're not a socialist then?	No.  I'd want to--	Good.	I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--	Are you going to have coffee?	Yes, please.	And you'll join me in a sambucca?	Thank you.
Personally James, I'm very excited by this new arrangement we have. It gives us direct access to literally hundreds of American collages.  Twentieth century history is a growth area over there, don't ask me why.  Your readership will be first and second year American collage students...	Freshman and sophomores...	You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.	Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it.	Thank you.	It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.	And to history.
So it's all worked out perfectly...	That's her.
Was that your chapter, then?  It was very good.	Thank you.  We met last week, at the Wajda film.  You won't remember. We didn't actually speak.	Yes, that's right.  I'm being terribly rude.  Bob?  Oh, Bob. This is Bob Tuckett.  Bon was at Oxford too.
Can I give you a lift?	No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
What did you think of that Wadja film?	I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.	I thought it was tremendous.	I think it went on rather too long.	I couldn't bear for it to end.	And I didn't like that man.	Oh, but he was terrific.	And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.	Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.	You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.	Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.	Too bad.  What did your father do?	My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.	And you're at this third stage	No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.	I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.	Oh yes?	Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.	How nice.	It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.	Both dead.	That must be rather nice, in a way.  I mean, you don't have any--
Damn.  They're early.	Who?	I called you a taxi.	Very thoughtful.	Well, you know...
Again?	Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
Why not stay?	I have to be up early.	Me too.	Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.	Too late.  Just my luck.
You don't trust me.	I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.	In radio we're different.	I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.	You just might.
I think we're ready now, thank you.  And how was Norfolk?  Did you get on with my mother?	I think she liked me.	Did she talk about me?	No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?	I haven't really thought about it.	Well, you should.
I haven't seen much of you.	No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.	He's all right, the professor.
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?	I might.	Might?
Might?	Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
Jeremy phoned this morning	What did he want?	He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.	That'll be fun	In your car	Why not.
Shall we have a drink or something?	Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
We don't seem to get much time to talk.	I know.  I'm sorry.
Not here.	To the airlift.	To the airlift.	Any sign of the goddess Barrington?	Not yet you know any of these people?	One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.	Nonsense.
Blasé and epicene.	We were just chortling over that. Blasé and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.	No jokes.  James is in love.
Bastard.	Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
To the Fleet.	To the Fleet.	And the Argies.	The Argies.
Now, top secret file.	Come on.  Hand over.
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.	It's shit.	You approve!	Let me see.	Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--	Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.	You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...	Oh yes.	...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.	Let me see.	Ah, ah.  There's more.  The piece celebrates the undying affection between eminent left-wing historian and he dazzling daughter.  Then the news editor, who happened to be in the room, said that years ago, when he worked on The Guardian, Anne Barrington had written a very good piece on...guess...Suez.  It was 1966, the tenth anniversary.
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.	Mmm...	It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...	You're so gross.	She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.	Ha ha...	According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.	You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?	No need to thank me, if you don't want to.  Just pay for these drinks.
That's enough of that.	We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.	Far too long.
What have you been up to?	"Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, ""Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"""	The torture of small children--	On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--	Hold those rights.	Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.	Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?	Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.	Will it be fun?
Perhaps I will, then.	I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.	I'll ring you.
Still in love?	I'm not sure.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?	Yes, finally.	Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.	Are you up to something?
Susan and I are very old friends, James.	Fuck off.	And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.	My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.	It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.	You're a piece of shit	I've known Susan for more than fifteen years.  James, we're old allies.
Hello.	Hello.	I'm waiting for your mother.	She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .	Thanks.	Why not sit down and wait?	Okay, I will.	She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.	Oh, I see.	Have you come to talk about me?	Not at all.  History.
What period?	Suez.  1956.	Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?	All right.	It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.	What about the Cromwells?	They don't count.
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?	Take a look at these.
Not bad.	Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.	Terrific.
It's that lady from Norfolk again.	I'm not here.	I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.	Next time tell her I've gone away.
Hello, Jimmy.	Dad.	Come into the kitchen.  I'm just making your mother's tea.
So how is she?	Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...	I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.	Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.	That's good.	And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.	Yes, you said.	Now, are you going to have some more tea?	No, thanks Dad.	Or a beer.  I've got some in.
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.	The bed's all made up if you want to stay.	I'll ring you in the next couple of days.
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?	No.	Well, it's worth seeing.
I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating.	Yes.	What would you call it?	I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.	Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.	U-huh.	In fact it's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs.  A completely successful fabrication of the past, the Ploughman's Lunch was.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.	She said that?	You weren't really interested in Suez at all.  Incredibly enough, you were interested in my wife.	Now listen...	No, no, let me go on before you get the wrong idea.  Ann and I have kept to our separate bedrooms for the last three years.  And I can't imagine that Susan hasn't hinted at the kind of life I lead in London.  I'm not telling you how to run your affairs.  I'm just saying ... I don't mind.  I'm giving you permission.
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.	Darling Susan.	You're so famous now.	And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?	We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.	In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
It was last year.	We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?	Oh no!	They won't let you in without one.
Don't point it at James!	Voila!
What have you got there?	You'd look naked without one.	Oh, yes!  Where's mine?  I want to look like you.
We'll see what we can do.	Promise?	Promise.
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.	It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.	It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'	Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.	No, he wasn't.  He just lowered himself into a bar stool and said...  'Oo I do feel bad.  I 'ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees!'
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.	I won't.  Goodnight.	'Night.
Ah, Susy, it...	Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
Don't you want to walk, Tom?	No.	Actually, I've been once today already.  I'll stay here with him.
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.	Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.	And that's why you never went pro?	Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.	Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?	Not yet.
Friends of yours, huh?	The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.	What's their program?	They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.	You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?	No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.	Thanks for stepping in.	De nada.
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.	Where?	Come with Tyler.  She knows.
Don't you gamble?	Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?	No, Bells Beach, Australia.
I gotta be fucking crazy.	Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.	I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.	I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.	A flaw I'm working on.	The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.	Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
How you figure?	News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
One shot stopping.	'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
Ever done this before?	Once.	Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.	Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--	Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.	So, who... uh, who packed my chute?	I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?	You gotta earn trust.	Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
We gonna jump or jerk off?	My man!
Utah, you copy bruddah?	Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!	I'll take that as a yes.
You gonna pull?	After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
Don't screw around man, pull it!	You do it... you first!	One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!	You first!	Okay!
What's this?	Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
You're a fucking dead man--	Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
Talk.	She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.	Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
We're wasting time.	See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
I can't do this.	Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?	Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!	Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
I'm not armed.	But you're not alone.	Good guess.  There's a gun on you right now.
Where's Roach?	Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?	You gotta tell me where she is.	And let my policy expire?  Sorry.	Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.	I say when it's over!	The guy you killed was an off duty cop!  If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.
Why should I?	What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?	No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!	Naw, you pull it!
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?	Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!	Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four...
Three seconds... two... one...	SHIT!!
Wild ride, huh?	Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.	I'm not FBI anymore.	You never were...	I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
Yeah?  What?	Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.	No.
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?	Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--	Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?	There's nobody else here...
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.	Yes, sir.
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?	Sir?	All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...	I take the skin off chicken.
This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--	1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.	That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?	Zero distortion, sir.
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.	Not so far.
How was the beach?	Fine.	Surf conditions okay?	A little mushy.	A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?	Babes.	What?	The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?	Caught my first tube this morning.
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?	Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.	What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?	Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.	That's the point, isn't it?	Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?	Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.	Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?	What that?
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.	The shit they pull, huh?
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.	Punk.  Quarterback Punk.	Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Good move.	Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
They don't go for the vault?	Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.	Smart.  You burn time in the vault.	Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.	The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.	Well, what're your ideas on these guys?	Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?	So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.	You watch your fucking mouth!  Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
Sorry.	Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?	Yeah.  What's your theory?	The fucking punks are surfers.
Oh well he must be a surfer.	Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.	The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?	Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.	Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.	Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
Johnny, it's the only way.	Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.	Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.	It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be?
I think you gotta hit them straight on!	Got it...
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?	It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.	Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.	Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?	No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
Big zippo so far.  How about you?	Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.	Thanks, buddy.
Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?	Okay, Dad.
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.	Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?	He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?	Right here, partner.
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?	Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?	Got it.	Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
Aw shit.	Nice tattoo, Dietz.
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?	Angelo, we gotta talk.
... so I started tailing him.	This Zen master surfer.	Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.	Did he rob it?	Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!	Yeah, or cashing a check.	Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.	Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.	Angelo... I'm right this time.  We can still win this one.
They're on their way to Maui.	No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.	Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.	I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.	Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
Time for lunch.	Angelo, it's eleven thirty.	That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.
The hell are they?!	They took a left at the next light!	You sure?!
Nothing?	Nothing.
I know where they're going.	Figured you did.
Angelo!  Don't fire!	Kid, get outta the way!!	NOOO!!
What do you want?	Shrimp and fries.	I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.	I need you to teach me.	Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?	I'm serious.	I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.	Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?	No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--	This gonna take long?	Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.	Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?	Sure.
Nice place.	He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
Who's the girl?	Catch of the day.	Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.	People are expendable to Bodhi.	Meaning you were expendable.	We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.	"Sure, he's ""the Bodhisattva""."	Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.	What are you talking about?	I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it.  Hey, Bodhi.
What's goin' on?	Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
I can barely do this in broad daylight.	Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
You had enough?	Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
Look at you.	What?	Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.	I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.	You don't have to.
Those are cold.	Warm them up.
I... I gotta go.	Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?	No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
Ouch.	Betadyne doesn't hurt.	You're kneeling on my hand.
So what'd the other guy look like?	Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.	But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?	Tyler, put the gun down.	You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--	Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
Well, I saw you and--	Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?	Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.	My name's Johnny Utah!	Who cares!	I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
Bye.	Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.	What do you mean?	Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.	I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.	I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.	What about the rest of Hopper's men?
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?	Something... in the trees...
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?	No way, old buddy.	You never did know when to quit.
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.	Like the old days, Dillon.	Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?	Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.	Go on.
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.	Who's our back-up on this?	No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.	This gets better by the minute.
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!	You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.	They're getting better equipped every day.
Mean anything to you?	Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?	Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.	Well somebody sent them.
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.	That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.	Why us?	Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.	What story did you give to Davis?	We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.	We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.	The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.	Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.	I can accept that, it comes with the job.	Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
You're wastin' your time.	No more games.
What the hell do you think you're doing?	We're going to need everyone.	What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.	We're not going.	That rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles, at most! We're almost home. But the chopper won't wait.
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.	Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.	This isn't your style, Dillon.	Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.	You know you can't win this one.
I'll see you there.	Right behind you.
Thanks.	Anytime.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...	What, Sergeant?	Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major...  ... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...	... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...	We both got scores to settle.
Any sign of the hostages?	We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
What's got Billy so spooked?	Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
You saw what?	I saw it.
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.	I'll take him.
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.	Thank you, Sergeant.
I'm sorry, Bull. It's never easy. He was a good soldier.	The best friend I ever had.
You're looking well, Dutch.	It's been a long time, General.
That's over the border, General.	That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
What have you got in mind, General.	We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.	What's that, General?	Someone else will be going in with you.
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.	There's something else, Major...	Mmmnnn...?	I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
What's he got?	Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with American equipment...
Major, you'd better take a look at this.	Hawkins?	I can't tell.
What in God's name...?	I think it's Hawkins.	Where the hell is his body?	There's no sign of it.
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?	He knows our defenses.	Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
Georgia.	No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?	Well... I might be going out to dinner.	You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?	I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?	Philip!  We'll need shoes!
Your uncle will like this.	He's not really my uncle.	They never are, dear.
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.	Twenty-five percent.
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...	You're not getting any navy contracts.
There's no way you could know that.	But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
We can reach an understanding on this.	I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.	Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.	I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
I like your hat.	Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.	Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.	Please, we hardly know each other.	Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?	No.	Hope to be?
It's... it's not like that.	I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
You don't know anything about me.	I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
What's that long building over there?	Storage, I think.	Not with those smokestacks it's not.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --	You what?	I talked to some developers about the land.
Congratulations, sir.	What?	Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished.  You've won.
Who are you going after next, sir?	Who indeed...
What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.	To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.	You've got a lot of nerve.	No.  What I have is a lot of money.	I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.	What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.	I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.	It is <u>not</u> your company.  It's a public company.  And I <u>am</u> going to acquire it.  Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.
Mr. Harris.	How are you, Mr. Kross.	Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it.
Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.	<u>Expected</u>... offer.	Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.	You're making the right decision, sir.
Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?	Yes.	If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
I... I would take advantage of it.	How?
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...	I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
Quiet.  Would I get the loans?	This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?	You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.	You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?	What's that?	You looking' for some company?	Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?	What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?	Yes.	Great.  What do I look like a tourguide?
No, you look like a hooker.	Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.	Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?	Sure.  For five bucks.	That's ridiculous.	The price just went up to ten.	Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?	Sit... and spin.	Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
Nice car.  Yours?	No.	Stolen?	Not exactly.
Mind if I turn on some heat?	If you can figure it out, be my guest.
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.	You're not from L.A., huh?	New York.	What motel you staying at?	<u>Ho</u>tel.	Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?	Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.	Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
What's your name?	What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.	You like being a hooker, Vivian?	It pays.	So do day jobs.	Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.	Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.	Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.	If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.	Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.	You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?	Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.	For the whole night?	For an hour.	You're joking.	I never joke about money.	Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
No, but it's getting there.	Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?	You couldn't afford it.
Three hundred.	Fine.	What's your name, lover.	Edward.  My name is Edward.	Edward... you got it!
Get in.  This side.	What?	You know how to drive a stick?
Better believe it.	Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.	Why?	You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.	You mean they don't have hookers.	Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...	Off the boulevard.	Exactly.
Room service.  What do you drink?	Diet coke.	Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.	Can I have some chips?	-- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.	Do you plan everything?	Always.	Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.	Fair enough.
Let's talk some more first.	Right.  So!  In town on business?	Uh-huh.	Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.	And why do you say that?	I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.	I've known a lot of everybody.
I think he wanted you to tip him.	Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
Where are they?  Shopping together?	They should be.  They're both good at it.
It's a very good year.	Oooh, thank god.
Try a strawberry.	Why?	Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.	Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.	Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
You really are a very beautiful girl.	Just a romantic, that's you.	Yes...
What do you like?	If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
Good morning.	You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.	No hurry.  Would you like some breakfast?
Did you sleep well?	Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.	Occupational hazard?
Where'd you go?	I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...	Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.	Mmm, I could tell.	I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.	I'd say you give a good dollar value.
Do you ever... enjoy it?	I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.	No?  Why's that?	"""Occupational hazard""."
I buy companies.	No shit.  They expensive?
The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.	... dollars?
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?	I sell them.	What?  Why?
By breaking up a company's assets --	What are assets?	Vivian --	C'mon, I might buy a company some day.	Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.	Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?	Not... quite.	There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.	Where'd you learn to do this?	I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?	Don't drown.
All right.  How much for the week?	What?	I'm in town until Saturday.
It'd cost you.	Of course.  How much?	Five full nights... days too?
Four thousand.	Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.	But you want days too.	All right, two thousand.	Three.	Done.	Holy shit.
I'm not just talking about sex.	Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?	Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.
Never answer the phone.  Ever.	Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.	Did you buy some clothes?	I got a dress, yeah.	Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.	It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.	Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?	"No, I don't ""got it"".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date."	This isn't a date.	Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?	The Rex.	Any good?	I think you'll approve.	... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.	Thank you <u>very much</u>.
Hello?	I thought I told you not to answer the phone.	Oooh!
I'm sorry.	You're forgiven.
And that's the way the game is played.	Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
You're upset, huh?	Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.	You liked the guy, though.	Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.	We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.	Television?	Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.	I have work to do.	Uh-uh.  No work.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.	I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.	Why not?	Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.	Was someone rude to you?	I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.	Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.
Okay.	Good.	Come with me?
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.	Thank you.  I would.  Nice.	Wait till you see what I have on underneath.	Please.
What about dinner?	Dinner can wait.
You always been rich?	No.	Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?	Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.	Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
You still mad at'm?	He died a long time ago.
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.	I think it's exciting.	What id we run into someone I know?	I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.	You did.
Real genuine guy.	He's good at what he does.	You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?	Shall we mingle?
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.	I'm sure that's true for some of them.	I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.	Ready to stomp sod?
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!	Vivian, what the --
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!	I don't know what you're talking about.	I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.	Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.	"Stuckey!  He wants an ""appointment"" with me after you leave.  You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?"
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.	I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.	Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?	Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.	Vivian...	Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.	Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.	Fuck off.	I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.	I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.	I really am sorry.
Do I look okay?	Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
What's that?	I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
Edward, I can't.	Shush.  Of course you can.	What if I lose it?	You won't.	What if someone tries to steal it?	I'll guard them and you with my life.
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.	Where are you taking me!?	To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...	Huh?	The opera.
I've never been on a plane before.	I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.	Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?	You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.	What happened to him?
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?	I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.	But don't they have it in English?	Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.	I more than liked it.	I know.  I'm glad.	Did you?	Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
One more night and you're finally rid of me.	Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.	I have to go to New York tomorrow.
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?	It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?	I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.	"When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, ""Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."""
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.	I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.	I've never treated you like a whore.	You just did.
What did you do to him?	What do you mean?	Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.	Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.	Right.	It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.	Business.	Yes.  The man made a business decision.	It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.	It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!	Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.	Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.	It was a business decision.
I got tired of hating my father.	It was good.	It felt good.
You're packing.	I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
Aw, don't... no...	Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.	I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?
I didn't think so.	Vivian...	It's not your fault.  You're right.  Kit's right.  But I want the fairy tale.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.	Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --	"I have a message for you from your ""niece"", sir."	My what?	The young lady staying in your room?
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.	Thank you.
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.	Afternoon.
What's up, where you going?	Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.	At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.	Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...	Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.	Cynthia's not coming?	No.
Love this car!  Is it new?	Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
I want to.	Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.	I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.	You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.	Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...	Oh, god, what?	I'll bring it back.
Edward, did you hear me?	I'm here.	I know a lot of nice girls.
What!?	We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
What time's diner tonight?	Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?	No one you know.
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?	Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.	Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry.
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.	We're letting them slide?	I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.	But, Edward...	Do it.
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --	Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.	And some of it's mine.  Edward, his jugular's exposed.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.	Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth.
Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?	We just did.	Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.	The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.	And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?	Yes...	Doing what?	Vivian's in sales.	Sales, really?  That's great. What does she sell?
Why do you want to know?	Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.	So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.	You're being ridiculous.	Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?	Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker.  I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.	Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.	Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.	Goodbye, Bill.
Did I wake you?	I'm up.	I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.	Why?	He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?	Give me twenty minutes.	We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
I don't think there's any sense in --	Let him answer.
Oh, my god... Edward, no!	I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?	Have you lost your mind?
What!?	Have a good day, gentlemen.
You broke my nose.	I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.	Edward, we've been together ten years.	And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!	All this because of that whore!	Yes.
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?	Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
Carlos had some great rock.	I bet.  That was our rent!
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.	Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?	Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.	I thought you were giving up that drug shit.	I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?	No, let's go to work.  Okay?	Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
Looks slow tonight.	Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --	Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.	That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --	Hey, hey -- There's a rent.	He's not gonna want us.
'Lo.	Kit!  Where've you been?	I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?	Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?	Why'd he want you?
He... he just does.	I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?	Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.	I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.	Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.	In Beverly Hills?	Yeah.	Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.	Was that you?	Who did you think?	Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...	Kit, I left that money for you days ago.	Yeah.  I just got it.
Kit...	Everybody keeps starin' at me.	Yeah... I know what you mean.	What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.	You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?	Where do you fit?
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.	Honey, you're not supposed to do that.	I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.	Oh, my god, you mean it was good?	It was great.	Dummy.	He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.	I pray for that.	All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?	Go for the bucks.	I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.	Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?	Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.	What kind of school?	School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.	"So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a ""B.""  Lift your dress and an ""A"" you'll see."
Want a pair of boots?	Do I!?  Momma!
You sure you won't come with me?	And leave all this?  Not in a million.
Couple a hours.	Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.	Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.	No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.	I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.	I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
Yeah, what?	Rent.  You're late.	Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.	Kit give me nothin'.	You bullshittin' me?	Of rent I do not bullshit.
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.	What?
<u>Housekeeping</u>.  I come to turn down the bed.	Okay.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?	I also place las chocolates on the pillow.	Oooh, I love those.	I leave extras, miss.	Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?
I'm just going to my room.	You're a guest here?	I'm -- I'm with a friend.	And who is that?	I... Edward...
What's your name?	Vivian.	Miss Vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Niece?	Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
I got a dress.	I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.	I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?	That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.	They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
What is it, Miss Vivian?	Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?	It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.	Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?	I think you'll find it normal enough.	Will I like it?	You'll like it fine.	Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.	But I always eat like this.	Either you're European or badly brought up.	Hmmm... I vonder vich.	Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.	What if they serve soup?	They will serve salad.	But what if they serve soup?	Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.	I like steak.	Then you would use your--	Steak spoon!
Miss Vivian --	Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.	Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?	Professionally?
Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.	Me?	I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.
Hi, Barney!	Miss Vivian.	Look I just wanted to say goodbye.	Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.	Yeah, well, I check out today.	You're not accompanying him to New York?	Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.	Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
May I help you?	I'm just looking, thanks.
Are you looking for something in particular?	Yes.  Something... conservative.	Yes...
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?	I don't think it would fit you.	I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.	It's very expensive.
What is with you?	Excuse me?	I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.	I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
Would you like to try it on?	'Scume me.
Yes?	Do you remember me?	No, I'm sorry, I don't.	I was in here yesterday.
Having a good time, Vivian?	Yeah.  Thanks.	All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard.
What?	It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.	I just might do that.
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.	I think it's great.
I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.	Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business.
Get out!	Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.	Then I'm here till I die?	Till they kill you. Yeah.	Then why bother curing me?	The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.	So it's to be torture.
You don't believe me?	You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands The Machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?	May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.	"He is a sailor on the pirate ship ""Revenge."" Promise to return him to his ship."	I swear it will be done.
My Westley will always come for me.	I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
He will come for me.	Of course.
Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.	Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
Every ship but the four you sent.	Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.	You're a silly girl.	Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.	I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-	Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.	Should I be?	Brides often are, I'm told.	I do not marry tonight.
I killed him myself.	Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
Who are you?	I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.	They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
Catch your breath.	If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...	And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.	I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you	You think your dearest love will save you? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.	You admit to me you do not love your fiance?	He knows I do not love him.	"""Are not capable of love"" is what you mean."	I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
Rest, Highness.	I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.	With pride. What can I do for you?	You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.	Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.	I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.	You mock my pain!	Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
Does it bother you to hear?	Nothing you can say will upset me.	"He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, ""Please. Please, I need to live."" It was the ""please"" that caught my memory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53."
"I asked him what was so important for him. ""True love,"" he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are."	And what am I?	Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?	You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
... as ... you ... wish...	Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.	As you wish.
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.	As you wish.
I fear I'll never see you again.	Of course you will.	But what if something happens to you?	Hear this now: I will come for you.	But how can you be sure?	This is true love. You think this happens every day?
Can you move at all?	Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.	"I told you, ""I would always come for you."" Why didn't you wait for me?"	Well ... you were dead.	Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.	I will never doubt again.	There will never be a need.
We'll never survive.	Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
Singed a bit, were you?	You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
"This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship ""Revenge"" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts."	But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?	I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.
"Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, ""All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning."" Three years he said that. ""Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning."" It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened."	What? -- go on --
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.	No. No. We have already succeeded.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.	Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?	Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
We did it.	Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?	Gently.	"At a time like this that's all you can think to say? ""Gently?"""	Gently!!
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?	What hideous sin have you committed lately?	I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.	It never happened.	What?	It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
"But it did. I was there. This old man said, ""Man and wife."""	"Did you say, ""I do""?"	Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.	Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.	I believe you -- So what happens now?	We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.	You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?	I could kill you now.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.	It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?	I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
You're quick.	And a good thing too.	Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.
Why is that, do you think?	Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Why should that make such a difference?	Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.	Who's Guilder?	The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin.  Go!
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.	You never said anything about killing anyone.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.	I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.	"Am I going mad or did the word ""think"" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass."
No more rhymes now, I mean it.	Anybody want a peanut?
I only dog paddle.	Veer left. Left. Left!
Faster!	I thought I was going faster.	You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.	Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.	-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.	Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.	I'm waiting!
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.	What do I do?	Finish him, finish him. Your way.	Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
Probably he means no harm.	He's really very short on charm.	Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.	Yes, some of the time.
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?	If there are, we'll all be dead.
Hello.	It's you.	True!
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.	Perhaps not. I feel fine.	Yeah?
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.	How many could you handle?	I don't think more than ten.	That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --	-- what? --	-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --	-- where?	To find the Man in Black, obviously.	But you don't know where he is.	Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.
The Man in Black?	His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
-- Fezzik, please --	Everybody ... MOVE!!
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.	The body?	Have you any money?	I have a little.	I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --	What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.	Has it been fifteen minutes?	We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.	How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
You've been mostly dead all day.	We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?	Over the Albino, I think.
Will this do?	Where did you get that?	At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.	Right, right, sorry.
Inigo.	What?	I hope we win...
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!	I'll be right back.
I brought you a special present.	What is it?	Open it up.
A book?	That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.	Has it got any sports in it?
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.	Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?	Yeah. It's really good.	Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
-hold it, hold it-	What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?	-- wait, just wait --	-- well, when does it get good?	Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --	I don't be-leeve this.
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --	-- murdered by pirates is good --
What?	The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.	Well, I wasn't nervous.
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.	Because I can stop now if you want.	No. You could read a little bit more ... if you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.
Oh no. No, please.	What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?	Someday, you may not mind so much.	Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.	Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.	Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.	I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!	Do you want me to go on with this?	Yes.	All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.	See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?	-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
Westley's only faking, right?	You want me to read this or not?	Who gets Humperdinck?	I don't understand.	Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?	Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?	Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
What? What?	No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.	I don't mind so much.
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.	Okay.	Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.	As you wish...
Yellin.	Sire.	As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.	My spy network has heard no such news.
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.	Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.	Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.	It won't be easy, Sire.	Try ruling the world sometime.
Rise and report.	The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.	Double it. My Princess must be safe.	The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.	I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.	Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.	I tell you once again -- surrender!	It will not happen!
For the last time -- SURRENDER!	DEATH FIRST!!
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.	No.  To the pain.	I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.	I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.	That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.	I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --	-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it	Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.	Who won? How did it end?	The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!	Shall we track them both?	The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters --  -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.
Could this be a trap?	I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.	I swear it will be done.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.	Of course.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?	Yes.	Then we will simply alert him.  Beloved, are you certain he still wants you? After all, it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp. Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.	Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.	Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
Your guess is as good as mine --	I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --	Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.	That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
And it is guarded by sixty men.	And our assets?	Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.	There we cannot help you.
Why? You can't even lift one.	True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.	I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
Now?	Not yet.
Now?	Light him.
Where's Fezzik?	I thought he was with you.	No.	In that case --
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.	Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.	Stop saying that!
No --	-- offer me money --
-- yes --	-- power too -- promise me that --
-- all that I have and more please --	-- offer me everything I ask for --	-- anything you want --	I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
What? What?	Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?	The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed!
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.	He's already dead.	He is, eh? I'll take a look. Bring him in.
Sir. Sir.	Hah?	We're really in a terrible rush.	Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?	Sixty-five.	Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.	Are you a rotten liar.	I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.	Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
He's dead. He can't talk.	Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.	What's that?
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.	"Sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. Except for a nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. They're so perky, I love that. But that's not what he said. He distinctly said ""to blave."" And, as we all know, ""to blave"" means ""to bluff."" So you're probably playing cards, and he cheated"
Humiliations galore!	That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
Thank you for everything.	Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
Slow going?	Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.	Sorry.	Thank you.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?	If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.	That does put a damper on our relationship.
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.	That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.	I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.	No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?	Nothing comes to mind.
We'll wait until you're ready.	Again. Thank you.
Do you always begin conversations this way?	My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
How old were you?	"I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."""	You've done nothing but study swordplay?	More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.	Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.	You are ready, then?	Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.	You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.	Begin!
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --	Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
You are wonderful!	Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
I admit it -- you are better than I am.	Then why are you smiling?
Because I know something you don't know.	And what is that?	I am not left-handed.
You're amazing!	I ought to be after twenty years.
There's something I ought to tell you.	Tell me.	I am not left-handed either.
Who are you?!	No one of consequence.	I must know.	Get used to disappointment.	Okay.
Kill me quickly.	I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
Making sure nobody's following us.	That would be inconceivable.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-	You're sure nobody's following us?	As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?	No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.	What?
Go in, get after her!	I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.	Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.	Inconceivable!
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!	You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
I want to duel him left-handed.	You know what a hurry we're in.	Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.	Oh, have it your way.
Let me explain-	-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.	There will be no arrangement --  -- and you're killing her!
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.	I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.	You're that smart?	Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?	Yes.	Morons.	Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.	For the Princess?
I accept.	Good. Then pour the wine.
Inhale this, but do not touch.	I smell nothing.	What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.	Hmm.
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.	You've made your decision then7	Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.	Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.	Wait till I get going! Where was I?	Australia.	Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.
You're just stalling now.	You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --	It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.	Then make your choice.	I will. And I choose --
What's so funny?	I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
You guessed wrong.	You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
-- get back, witch --	I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.	You never had it so good. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.
"""True love."" He said, ""true love,"" Max. My God --"	Don't say another word, Valerie.	He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.	Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --	What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck	I'm not listening.	A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --	Nobody's hearing nothing!	Humperdinck. Humperdinck! Humperdinck!
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?	An hour.	Yeah, an hour.	A good hour. Yeah.
Bye-bye, boys.	Have fun storming the castle.	Think it'll work?	It would take a miracle. Bye!	Bye.
You feeling any better?	A little bit.	Guess what.	What?	Your grandfather's here.	Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick?	You are sick, that's why he's here.	He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.	Maybe he won't.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?	Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?	Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.	I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...	Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!	That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.	Congratulations.	Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody.
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.	What are you saying?	Let's hear him.  What have we got to lose?  What's your name?
"""By the light, by the light,"	"""Of the silvery moon,"	"""Of the silvery mooooon,"	"""I want to croon,"	"""He wants to croon, he wants to croon,"	"""To my honey I'll croon,"	"""He's gonna croon love's tune,"	"""Honeymoon,"	"""Honeymoon, honeymoon,"	"""Keep a shining in..."
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.	How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...	You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.	I'll wait in the hall ...	Oooooooops!	Ooooooops.
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?	Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?	Scared.  Can't talk.
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.	I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady.
Yes sir.	Then account for yourself!  Do you believe in God?  Do you believe in gold?  Why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  Bit of a pervert, eh?
But sir, I'm not condem ...	Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...	Do the books!  Do the books!	Yes, sir.  Thank you.	Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.	Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?	I have hurt your feelings.	Good, what is it?	Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?	Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.	Well, sir, it seems ...	You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.	In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...	Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
What is that?  A handkerchief?	It's nothing ... nothing.
Here, don't panic.	I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.	They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?	Mr. Bialystock ...	Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.	Where?  What?	According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.	I went to a Turkish bath, who cares? The show was a flop.  What difference does it make?	It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.	Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.	But that's cheating!	It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
Help!	All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.	Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.	Oh, it's all right ... wha?	Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.	Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.	Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.	Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
Yes, what?	What you were saying.  Keep talking.	What was I saying?	You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.	Yes, it's quite possible.	You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
Assume away!	Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.	What do you mean?	You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.	What did I do?	You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.	So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.	Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.	But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.	Exactly.  And how long did it run?	One night.
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.	But what if the play was a hit?	Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?	Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.	What scheme?	What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.	Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.	Bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.	No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.	Mr. Bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, I doctored your books. That, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.	You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?	You're going to jump on me.	You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.	What???	Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.	I'm not going to jump on you!	Aaaaaaaaaa!
Will you get a hold on yourself.	Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!	What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?	I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.	Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?	It's a little better, but you still look angry.	How's this?
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.	"Well, you know what they say, ""Smile and the world smiles with you.""  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?"	Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.	They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.	That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.	Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.	Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.	I already have.  Come on.	Oh.
Where would you like to eat?	Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?	Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.	Coney Island??	What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?	I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.	Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?	Right.	Then stick with Bialystock!
What kind now, Leo?	I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.	Two pistachios, my good man.
Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?	I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.	Maybe you're happy.	Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.
You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life.	You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.	I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!	This is where we belong, Leo.  On top of the world.  Top of the world!
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.	Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?	I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.	You found a flop!	A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty!
It won't run a week!	Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.	Who wrote it?
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.	Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
"There it is... in red and white! ""Springtime For Hitler,"" signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?"	Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.	Okay, take it off, take it off.
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.	Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.	Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.	Leo, what if this play is a hit?	Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.	OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money.
What are you doing?	I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?	"They'll say, ""Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."""	What is she gonna do here?	I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.	Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!	But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.	Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.	Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?	Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.	Do you think he'll take the job?	Only if we ask him.
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?	It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
So much for Nutsy Fagin.	Here comes the Times Drama Critic.	Watch closely, as Bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin.
To failure!	To failure!
Maybe it's not true!	No way out.  No way out.	Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.	No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?	Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.	The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.
What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?	I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.
I never should have listened to you.	Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.	Double.  Double.  Double.
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!	What???	Shut up.
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!	Liebkind, no!	What are you doing?  We're trapped. It's either the show or us.  There's no way out.  What can we do, blow up the theatre?
Max, I...	What is it?
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.	Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
Don't help me.	He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt?
I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?	Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.	"Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  ""Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."""	Mr. Liebkind, wait ...	"""I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ..."	Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.	"My play?  You mean, ""Springtime For ... "" you know who?"	Yes.	Vat about it?	We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.	You're not, as you Americans say, dragging my leg, are you?
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.	With whom?
Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.	No kidding?	Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.	Really, I never dreamed ...	That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!	That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart.
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?	We swear it!	Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?	Yes.  We would!	Good.  I will make the preparations.
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...	It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
Vaaaat???	Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.	But he has long hair!	Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.	I don't know.  I don't know.
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.	All right, but remember, if you damage the Fuhrer's reputation, I kill you.
Not.	Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.	I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...	You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?	Always.	Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?	It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.	You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...	Come on.  Let's get going.	Qviet.  Qviet  This is very important.
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.	You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?	Yes.  Amazing isn't it?
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!	All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
Do it!  Do it!	I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child.
Do you need us?	Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty.	Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.	Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.	Got dag pa dig.
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.	Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
Min Bialystock.	Nice girl.
Come on.  We'd better hurry.  We're late.	Call chauffeur.  Get car.	Good.  Good.  We go Motel.	No.  We go.
You, Blum go Motel.	No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.	Get car.  Get car.	Very nice girl.
We make love?	No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.	You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
Finder's keepers.	Here I come, ready or not.
Feeling better?	Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?	Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.	We can't play today?	Thursday.  Thursday.  We'll play Thursday.  We'll play the Contessa and the chauffeur.	Oh, the best one.	Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.	Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.	All right.  All right.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.	I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.	Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.	Good.  That's enough.  We'll do the rest on Thursday.  That's a good girl.  It's always such fun to see you.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.	Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.	Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.	And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.	And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
Like clockwork.	I shall count the minutes.	Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!  Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ... Lucretia, Lucretia!
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.	I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.	Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.	Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.	Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.	Ta.  Ta.	Ta.  Ta.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.	Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
I solemnly swear...	By the sacred memory...	By the sacred memory...	Of Siegfried...	Of Siegfried...	Wagner...	Wagner...	Nietzche...	Nietzche...	Bismark...	Bismark...
Hindenburg...	Hindenburg...	The Graf Spee...	The Graf Spee...	The Blue Max...	The Blue Max...	And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.	And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.	Heil you know who!	Heil you know who!	Good.  Good.  Now ve sign the contract.
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.	Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.	"""Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."""	"""Deutchland, Deutchland ... """	Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.	Vat?	People can hear you.	"OH.  ""I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... "" Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come!"
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.	Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
Okay.	Where are you going vit the light?	I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?	Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.	What have you done, LSD?	Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.	I mean in show business.	Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.	What do you do best?	Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.	Oh, sing.  Sing!	Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?	Sing a song!  Just sing a song!
We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.	No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!	Who can we attack?  They're all too big.	Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!	We can't... we keep our money there!
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?	Send for Goebbels.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.	Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.	What did you tell the people?	I told them we invaded England.	Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?	We won.	Groovy!
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.	In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.	I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?	Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...	No trouble. Today's linen day. I change all the beds once a week, whether they've been used or not... dampness. I hate the smell of dampness.  It's such a dank smell.
You out to buy a motel?	No.	Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?	I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.	I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.	I'm not the police.	Oh.
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?	No. No one has stopped here in weeks...	Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?	Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.	Look at the picture. Please.
No. At least I don't recall.	She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...	I don't even bother with guests registering any more... I mean, little by little, you drop the formalities.  I shouldn't even bother to change the linen. I guess habits die hard. Which reminds me...
Now there's a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?	What?	You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...
"Don't know where she got ""Marie,"" but ""Samuels"" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?"	I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.	Tell me all about her.	She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.	How early?	Very early. Dawn.	Of which morning?	The following morning. Sunday.	No one met her?	No.	Or arrived with her.	No.	She didn't call anyone? Even locally?	No.	You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?	No! Of all...	How do you know she didn't make a call?	She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.	Back where?	What do you mean?	"You said she was sitting ""back there,"" or standing rather..."	Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.	How did she pay you?	What?	Cash or check? For the cabin...	Cash.	And when she left, she never came back.	Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...	I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.	I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...	She isn't still here, is she?	Not at all!	Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?	Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like.  Come on.
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.	Anyone at home?	I live there. Alone.	Someone is sitting in that window.	My mother.
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.	If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?	Of course not.	If she paid you well?	Now, look...!	Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?	I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!	I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.	That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.	Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?	No. I told you, she's confined...	Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.	Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...	No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...	All right!  Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother.  But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I?
Let's all talk about Mary.	Who are you, friend?	Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator.  Where is she, Miss Crane?
What's your interest?	Money.
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then...	Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
Why?	Must've needed it.	What are you talking about?  What is this?
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...	She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.	I don't believe it.  Do you?
I don't know.	Wouldn't have been able to tail you if you did.
Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?	Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...	Casharoonie!	Sam, if she's here...
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?	Not even a hunch. Just hope.	With a little checking, I could get to believe you.	I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
I'm in no mood for trouble!	What?	"There's an old saying, ""First customer of the day is always the most trouble!"" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me..."	Can I trade in my car and take another?	You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?	Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...	Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...	No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!	How much?	Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...	It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?	You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?	Of course not. Please.	Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.	Five hundred.	Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?	All right.
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...	I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...	In the building ...  Mary starts for the building, glancing once in the direction of the Patrolman.
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.	I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...	I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...	But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?	No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.	I'd like to be ready when he gets back.	Okay. If you'll come along...
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?	He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?	It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.	You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
Were there any calls?	Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.	I don't need pills... just sleep.
Yes, Mr. Lowery.	Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?	No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.	Buzz me the minute she comes in.
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....	I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.	You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...	Her sister's going to do that.  She's as worried as we are.
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!	Now. Your sister is missing how long?	She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...	How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
Yes.	She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
She stole some money.	A lot?	Forty thousand dollars.	And the police haven't been able to...
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.	With the forty thousand dollars?	He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!	Like what?	Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!	I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.	He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
Please!	Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...	What difference does that...	Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
Yes.	Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
Did he say anything about my sister?	Just what he told your detective.
I still feel...	Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't make you feel better. You want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... And the theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that's the sooner you'll stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. How about that?	I don't know.
Yes?	May I talk to you?	Sure...
I'm Mary's sister.	Lila.	Is Mary here?
Is something wrong?	I want to know if my sister is here.	Here?	With you.	Where?	I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.	What's the matter?	Don't you know?
What should I know?	To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?	No. I take it you don't either?  How long?	Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.	And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?	A good reason, I suppose.	Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...	Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.	I was getting to that!	What do you know about it?	Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.	Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
What thing?	Huh?	What thing could we be in together?	I hate tears.	Is Mary... in trouble?	Yes.	Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?	Not that kind...  You men and your egos.	Never mind my ego. Let's talk about Mary.
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...	You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...	It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?	No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.	He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...	I ought to call the police right now!	No.	Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?	How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...	She haven't even called you?	I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!	I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.	You've led a charmed life.	No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...	Maybe we can handle it together.	I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.	I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.	You want me to stay here?	She'll need both of us.	Where... can I stay?	First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?	Sam. He said an hour. Or less.	It's been three.	Are we just going to go on sitting here?	He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?	You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.	Hundreds! Which one is your pet?	Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.	I feel better when you feel better.	Where's the old highway?	You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.	Yes.	That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.	Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!	Arbogast said...	An hour! Or less!
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think.	Sam! Why call when we can go?	And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
Probably on his way back right now.	Sam, I'm going.	You'll never find it.
Stay here.	Why can't I go out there with you?	I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.	Just wait here?	Contemplate your... panic button.
He didn't come back here?	Sam.	No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.	Where could he have gone?	Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...	Without calling me?	In a hurry.	Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...	Yes. I think he would have.
Let's go see Al Chambers.	Who's he?	He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.
Our Deputy sleeps.	Well?	Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.	Does that mean we can't...	No. I'm just procrastinating.  People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  Come on.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.	I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.	Yes.	This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...	All right! Then call! At least, call!
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.	You're not.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.	Neither will I.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.	Of course we will.	Alive.
Where'd you go to college?	I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.	She was willing to lick the stamps.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.	We were going to get married. Are going to get married!	Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.	This is the old highway.	I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.	Watch your tenses.	Huh?	She always tries to be proper.
You going to wait here for me?	I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...	We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.	You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!	I believe it.
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?	Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.	I'm glad we didn't.
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.	I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?	Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?	How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...	There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!	What makes you sound so certain?	Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
Sorry.	Hospital clean.	What?	The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
What is it?	It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...	Bates never denied Mary was here.	Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.	Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?	Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
You can't go up there.	Why not?	Bates.
It's regular. Okay?	I could stand something regular.
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.	What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?	We could laze around here a while longer.	Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.	I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...	When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.	You sure talk like a girl who's been married.	Sam!	I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.	I've lost my girlish laughter.	The only girlish thing you have lost.	Sam. This is the last time.	For what?	This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.	Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?	I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.	And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy!	It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...	You can't laugh at it, huh?	Can you?	Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
And besides, when you say I make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.	You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.	I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.	I have to go, Sam.	I can come down next week.	No.	Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?	We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!	And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?	Sam! No!	All right.
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.	You make respectability sound... disrespectful.	I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.  But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind.
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.	I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.	A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...	I haven't even been married once yet!	Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.	Sam, let's go get married.	And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.	I'll lick the stamps.
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.	I'm thinking of it.	How can you even think a thing like that!	Don't miss your plane.	Hey, we can leave together can't we?	I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
Dirty night.	You have a vacancy?	We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.	I thought I'd gotten off the main...	I knew you must have. No one stops here anymore unless they do.
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.	Los Angeles.
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.	There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.	Am I that close to Fairvale?	Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
"Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with ""Bates' Motel"" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there...."	The bathroom.	I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.	Thank you, Mr. Bates.	Norman Bates.
You have something most girls never have.	I have?	There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.	Thank you. Again.	You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?	No.	Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.	I'd like to.	All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella.
I've caused you some trouble.	"Mother...  ...what is the phrase... ""she isn't herself today""... I think that's it."	You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.	Don't worry about it.  But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
You're very... kind.	It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
You eat like a bird.	You'd know, of course.	"Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats ""like a bird,"" is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.  Oh, I don't know anything about birds. My hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because...  well, I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but I can't... I think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather...  passive, to begin with... most of them..."
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.	Uncommon, too.	I imagine so.	It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything.	A man should have a hobby.	It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.	Is your time so empty?	Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.	You go out... with friends?	Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?	Only my share.	Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...	I'm looking for a private island.	What are you running away from?	Why do you ask that?	No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.	Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.	I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.	You should... mind it.	Oh I do... but I say I don't.	If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.	Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.	She sounded strong...	I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.	Except you.	A son is a poor substitute for a lover.	Why don't you go away?	To a private island, like you?	No, not like me.	It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.	Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
"An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse ""someplace.""  Put her in Someplace!"	I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...	What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.	I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...	Well? You meant well?  People always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that...
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?	Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.	Thank you, Norman.	Norman.	You're not going to... to your room already?	I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.	Phoenix?	I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.	Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.	I'd like to, but...	Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...	Very early. Dawn.	Alright, Miss...	Crane.	That's it.	Good night.
In quite a hurry.	Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...	You slept here all night?	Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...	There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...	I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?	No, m'am.	Then I'm free to go...?	Is anything wrong?	Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?	Frankly, yes.	Please... I'd like to go...	Is there?	Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...	Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor off, please.
"In the course of my duty, I never ""take up"" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest..."	I'm sorry.	No need to apologize...
Wait a minute!	Now what?
May I see your license?	Why?	Please.
Oh?	Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...	You didn't!  It's tinkerbell.  Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night.  Well come on in, at least!
We have a problem.	Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
Mary is Lila's sister?	Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...	Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.	He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...	Norman took a wife?	No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?	Maybe you saw Mary!	I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman.
We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd go out to the motel with you.	He's already been.
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.	At this hour?
Recluse. Kinder word.	You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...	Arbogast.	Arbogast.  And after he left?  No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been going out there?  Well, I think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you know... but...
Barefaced.	He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.	It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.	Norman found them dead together.  In bed.
Went out before service.	Have you two had breakfast?
Just coming up to ring for you.	I suppose you want a cabin.	We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.
I'll take you to...	Better sign in first, hasn't we?
It isn't necessary.	Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
I'll get your bags.	Haven't any.	I'll show you the cabin.
Looking for me?	Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.	Satisfied with your cabin?	Fine.
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?	Yes.	I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.	That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?	Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you?
I'm not saying you shouldn't be contented here, I'm just doubting that you are. I think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you'd unload this place...	This place! This isn't 'a place.' It's my only world. I grew up in that house back there. I was a happy child. My mother and I... we were more than happy.	And now that your mother's dead?
My mother is not dead!	I didn't think so.
You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?	I don't know what you've been saying.	I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?	Do what?	Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!	Shut up!	Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...	Leave me alone!	...Forty thousand dollars!	Leave me alone!
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!	Mother, please...	And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?	Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...	Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?	Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?	Shut up! Shut up!
They thought she'd be coming to me.	Left Phoenix under her own steam?
Yes.	From what?
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.	Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.	He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
Was that all?	This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?	Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.	And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother.
You didn't find anything.	Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
No mother.	You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.	Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.	You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?	Did I?	That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.	What--special autopsy?
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.	Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?	Just before she died she came to--	Did she talk?	Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]	[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
Did you wish to see someone?	I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
You mean he doesn't work for you?	No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.	It is--you know what a struggle he's had.	Indeed, he has often told me.
He's inherited a fortune.	You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.	He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.	I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.	Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.	That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.	Okay--I'll be here at eight.
Gosh, you had me fooled.	Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
So--friendly or otherwise--?	[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.	Then you knew of the inheritance?	Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.	No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--	I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.	Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.	Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.	What do you mean &quot;our&quot;?
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.	How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
No-	Who are you? What is your name?	I don't know, [I tell you].
What made you steal? Are you hungry?	No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.	Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.	Maybe you want my money, too.
No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.	You--a friend to me?	Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?	I don't know--I can't tell--
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--	Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.	Papers--they all want me to sign papers.	Dr. Meirschultz, too?
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh	Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.	That sounds to me very remarkable.	It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.	Maybe you're right.	I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.	Why didn't you notify the police?
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.	He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.	[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?	Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
Thousands?	Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?	Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.	Oh, I see. Cats' fur.	That's it. You get it quick.	But where do the rats come in?	You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]	By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.	You found Buckley?
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?	Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
How do you do.	Well, news of Buckley?	Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?	Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.	So--that's it. Buckley took the body.
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?	Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.	Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.	Do you have many patients, doctor?	Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.	Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
What's down there?	Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.	I'd like to have a look.
You here again?	Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?	Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
What's that?	Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
Take me down there.	It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.	Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?	Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--	Come on, we're wasting time.
Dr. Meirschultz, please.	He isn't here.
What are you going to do?	I'm going to call the police.	No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.	Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.	How? What can I do?
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]	It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.	Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
What is it?	The wound is bleeding!	Go to sleep!
What is it now?	I'm losing my blood!	You're losing your blood?	Yes!	Nonsense! ... It's here! ... Your blood ...
What were you dreaming about?	A voice ...	That spoke to you?	That called ... commanded ...	What did it say?
Your father?	Yes!	The master ... is asleep!
Did you hear?	Yes, the child ...
The child!	Yes.	There's no child here.	But ... the dogs...
There's no child here, and no dogs either.	No?	No!  Good night!
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.	Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.	The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.	Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.	The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.	Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].	The blood transfusion is completed. While Marc himself is looking after the patient, the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room, where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage. The doctor stands bending over Léone.
You killed him!  Come on with the rest of it. You killed him!	No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.	But you were in on it -- you worked for him.	No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.	You lie!	It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue!
Yes, why?	I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?	I wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about Ralph. He's the sweetest kid I know.
What are you laughing at?	I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.	I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.	I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.	Did you? Where?	In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?	I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.	I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.	I don't agree with you.	All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.	You would.	He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.	You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.	Then marry Ralph ... you'll be the happiest couple in the world.
But what about lunch?	I'll have it for supper.  So long.
There's no hurry. It's early.	I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.	Why didn't you eat last night?	Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.	What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.	I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.	You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?	No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.	If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.	Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
I think so.	Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?	Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.	Delighted, I'm sure.
But why? She's the best friend I've got.	She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.	Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.	What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.	I won't let you say that!	Well, I do say it.	She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--	Don't kid yourself -- she means it.	Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?	I'm not quarreling, only ...
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.	I'd call it stupid at any time.	Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.	So that's the way it is?	That's the way I feel about it.	I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.	Thank you.	Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?	I'd love to, at any time.
We'll be coming to the opening.	At any time. You will always be welcome.
But I think these things are beautiful.	They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.	Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.	No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.	Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.	But it was really my fault.	And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?	I'd love to.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.	It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
Let me go! Let me go!	We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.	Ralph! Ralph!
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.	And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
What! What are you talking about?	The body of Joan Gale!	Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?	I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.	Are you giving me this straight?	Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.	What do you think I am?	Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.	It happens that I'm the law.	How quaint. But I can go any place you can.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.	You mean he was colored?	I don't know what he was, but he made Frankenstein look like a lily!
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!	Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.	Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?	Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?	Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?	Charming. More delightful people crippled.	Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.	Meaning what?	That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!	What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!	All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?	Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?	That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti!	Quick, Watson, the cookbook!
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.	If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.	Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.	I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?	And ruin a perfectly good story? Don't be silly.	No, I mean it. I think this kid's entitled to a break.	He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.	You give me a pain!	I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.	Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.	You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.	Well, I won't work on it from that angle.	Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --	And they never proved anything against him.	Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.	Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.	Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.	Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?	You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.	All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else.	Hey, come here, Sob-sister!	Nope, I'm through!
On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...	Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.	No, there's another point I want to iron out.	Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
Which one is me? The horse?	Get out of here.
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?	I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.	Hey, Mattie, dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on Joan Gale.
Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.	So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
I am right! I know I'm right!	Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.	All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.	Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.	Now don't that call for an extra!	I asked you to keep your trap shut!	Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.	All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!	No kiddin'. What's your idea?	Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.	We'll grant that.	What!	About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?	Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?	I used to be married to one.	And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!	Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.	Let it go.	Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.	All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is.	Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.	What do you mean?	That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.	No kiddin'?	Almost certain.	Almost! I'll still bet I'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.	You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?	This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.	What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!	Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.	Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.	Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?	What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.	I'm going to make you eat dirt, you soap bubble! I'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go!
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?	Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
That's what I said.	I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.	Where were you going when you got in that cab?	I don't remember. Not so very far--	Don't remember what day that was, do you?	No, sir. About three months ago.
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?	No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.	You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?	Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
Call the Homicide Squad!	How's every little thing?	Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?	I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!	No kiddin'.	I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.	I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?	Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.	Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!	No foolin' -- any suspect?	Do you know George Winton?	Old Howard Winton's cub?	That's the one.	They don't suspect <I>him</I>?	Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.	Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...	Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.	What does that prove?	Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.	Hotcha! Saved, one job!
Make it snappy, Colonel.	There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.	Don't give this to anybody else, will you?	It's all yours.	Thanks.
Where'd you get the stag hound?	He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.	What do you mean police dog?	Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.	Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.	Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing.  Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
I told you he was a sore.	Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.	Here's a wow.
Fine, thanks.	Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.	Don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
He might get some publicity out of it.	No use. He's a crab, I tell you.	Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.	Horsefeathers!
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?	I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?	I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.	Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?	No. I wanted to do it without saying anything. I think he's worth it.
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?	Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before --	Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.	Yes, sure, that's fine. While I'm proving my innocence, you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick I ever did ... you're going to write editorials about every cocktail I ever drank. Anything that any sane, normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning, if I did it.  Go on! Get out! I don't want to talk to you!
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --	Cry-baby?	That's what I said.	My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--	Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?	For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --	Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?	They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.	Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?	She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.	I see. Was that all she said?	We planned a trip for her. I was going to send her to Bermuda.	You weren't going with her?	No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.	Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.	Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...	Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.	Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...	That happens to be the truth.	Who'd steal her body?	That's what they're going to ask you.
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.	Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?	Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.	What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.	I told you I didn't want to mix in it.	All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?	I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.	No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it.
Why?	You go in for dangerous things.	Darned if I don't!
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.	I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.	It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.	No, really -- I'm crazy about you.	Oh, is that what caused it?	You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?	How much money have you got?	Heaven knows. A lot.	Well, that being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors. Hey, listen, aviator, here we are!
What is it? What happened?	Don't ask any questions. Come on!
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine.	Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.	My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.	She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.	You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?	I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back.	It will always afford me great pleasure to see you.	Good night, sir.	Good night.  And I am very grateful to you.
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!	That is unfortunate.
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.	Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?	Is that a fact?	No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these.	Fire insurance!	Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?	I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.	You are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ...
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!	And you think I will permit this, my friend?	You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.	And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.	Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!	You're insane.	Not at all -- let me show you how easily it can be done.
If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?	One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.	And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.	That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?	Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.	But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.	If it is freedom to represent people with limbs that don't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose. Anatomy! Heaven forgive you. You must have studied with a sideshow of freaks!
To lunch.	To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.	But I have some friends waiting.	That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.	I will only be gone about half an hour.	If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.	All right, I'll tell them. They're right here in front.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.	Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
Have you got it? Is it completed?	Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.	Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
Shall we unpack it?	Yes.
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.	You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
She is the soul of that statue.	I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
What are you laughing at?	He can't hear you.
I'd know him anywhere.	Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
Yep. Everything settled.	Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.	I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.	They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.	Well, any time I can do anything for you --	Thanks.
To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.	You taking any medication?
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?	Dad...
Two: what if I didn't miss?	You did.	Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?	You did miss --	-- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?   What did your life mean?  Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?
What was her name?	Excuse me???	What was her name?  The one I met.
Mia...?	Yes....
I've been dreaming about you.	Day or night?
Could we go somewhere?	I'm heading out of town.	Okay.
What?	I could go out of town.
Could you?	Where to?	A place you've never been.	That's the physicist's playground.
Why am I doing this?	It's an experiment.
We flopped the first time out.	At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
Could be.	What universe are you in, Paul?	A quantum one.
Nothing is real until it's perceived.	The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.	How?
Of what?	God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
What did it want?	"That's what it asked me.  ""What do you want?""  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment."	Like now?
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.	Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --	A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --	Dysfunctional --	That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --	And glow happily ever after.
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.	Wait.  I want to tell you something.
I've been dreaming about this.	Then you get it.  You'll understand.	What?
Why?	So I can move on.  You too.
Yes?	Is Rose here?	She must have gone out for a walk with the children.	Well, I got to see her.	She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.	Where is she?	I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.
They're filthy, Mother.	Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.	I know, Mother.	But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.	I am in awe of it, Mother.	I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.	Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.	This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.	Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?	Sure. Let me take your suitcase.
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?	Nobody.	But who were they?	They were just bad men, that's all.	In what sense were they bad?	Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.	Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute?
Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?	Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.	Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?	What terrible thing in Cave Springs?	There was this old man that ate his niece.
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.	He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.	I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.	Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.	Buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, I don't want to talk to you. I'm going out and sweep the patio.
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?	Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?	Well, all right.
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.	What is it, Rose?	It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.	What'd you do, Rose?	Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...	You were pretty bad, huh?	Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.	But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?	Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!	But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?	I fell madly in love with him when he called me Rosebud. You know that first day when I come and he said I looked graceful like a capital letter S and called me Rosebud? I fell madly in love with that man right then.  But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a good man and won't have nothin' to do with me.
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.	What did you expect?	Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.	Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.	There's some kind of gristle in it, though.	Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.	Actually, I am, though.	You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.	Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?	No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.	Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?	Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.	But I'm curious, Rose.
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?	Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.	Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.	You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.	Aw, be a good sport, Rose.  You like me, don't you? I like you a lot.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?	Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.	'Course it does.	First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.	All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.	That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.	Don't mention it.	It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.	Who would want to do such a thing as that?	Well, some fiend might.	You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.	There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.	There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.	Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.	Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.	Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?	I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.	Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.	Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?	No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!	Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?	Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!	Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.	Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.	Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.	Buddy, you're just a child.	I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?	Well, nothin'.
You better quit that.	But Rose...	I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.	Am I hurting you?	No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.	But why, if I'm not hurting you?	You wouldn't understand.  Oh, God, I must be outta my mind. What would your Momma think?
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?	No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?	Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.	I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.	Good night, Rose.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.	I said I wouldn't.	Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as I've been please have pity on me and don't ruin me by telling them what I did. I know it was bad, it was bad and dumb. But mostly it was dumb, I didn't mean you no harm, I'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that's the truth. I love you. But they'd think I did, they'd think I was awful, they'd despise me and hate me...
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!	Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life.  Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.	You're going to get yourself up and go out?	Buddy, Mr. Right is out there somewhere and I'm gonna find him!
Here comes Daddy.	I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?	Yeah.	You're my sweetheart.
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.	Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
I got an awful toothache.	Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.	But I don't know who they are.
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!	Rose, you are too uncritical of people.	You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.	He did?	"Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, ""You know, you are beautiful."" Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?"	Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.	He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?	Yeah, I'd believe it.	Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.	Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.	I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas.
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!	You won't die, Rose.	Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.	I don't want to know...
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?	Okay.	Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.	What are you going to do, Rose?	Take a little walk with me, huh?
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?	They're dumb things. I got tired of them.	Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?	Five hundred rabbits?	Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.	How did the rabbits kill him?	He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.	Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.	Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.	What was your mother like?	A saint just like your own mother. She's up in heaven right now, her and Lunette, there ain't no doubt about it.
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.	Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
Neither do I.	Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.	I do, too.
Yeah, I know.	Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.	I do, too!	All right, what do you know?	Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!	Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
Of course not!	Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
You were up late last night, Brother.	Well, a little.	Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?	Well, yeah.
Son, was Rose in your room last night?	No. Why should Rose be in my room?
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?	I don't know.	The girl strikes like a cobra.
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.	Yeah, he's still up there.	What's taking the rascal so long?
What do you think, Brother?	I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.	He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son.  Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.	Well, it's not very plain.	That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?	But how would you find him?	Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?	Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.	True, but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder. Now let's go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with.
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.	Well... maybe...	And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night! I am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all I am going to do!
Open that door, damn you!	Daddy, what's the matter?	She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me!  Rose, open this door immediately!
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?	No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
The new girl is here.	Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?	She talks a great deal and smiles a lot. She's very pretty, she has a real good figure. She's very girlish or womanish, if you know what I mean. She wouldn't hurt anybody, this girl. She couldn't.
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.	You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.	All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?	In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.	Walked, in all that heat? It's a wonder she hasn't got sunstroke. I'll phone Daddy and you go get Doll Baby and Waski.
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?	Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.	Oh, Brother, I am so disappointed in you. You mustn't look at those horrible things, they degrade the human image.
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?	This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.	Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!	Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.	Uhhh, gahdam stuff!	What did you say, Brother?	I said ahhh-dam stuff.	No, you didn't say that, Brother.	Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff.
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?	She's getting herself up to go out.	What'd you say, Brother?	She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.	Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty...
Heh, what a hypocrite.	I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.	Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.	I'll be right back.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.	Oh, shut up, Buddy.
Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?	No.
It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.	I think Daddy suspects.	No, he doesn't. Not really.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.	She's watching the car again?	Yeah.	I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
There goes Mother.	Yeah.	Let's go peep from the living room.	Okay.
I think she's gonna kiss him.	At least.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?	They're discussing it.	I can't see, let me see...
This is my place and you can't have it.	Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?	He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!	Let me see!
Now I can't see. What are they doing?	Boy! Wow!
Wow! Brrrother!	What are they doing?	Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.	What are they doing, Doll?	He kissed her.	Is that all?	He had his hand on her titty.	Let me look.  Aww-rr...
She's putting the titty back.	Buddy, that was my place.
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.	You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?	Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.	You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.
No, Mother, he's lying...	Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.	Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.	So am I.	She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.	It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.	Then why does she act so dumb?	Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll. And neither does smartness. You see --
What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?	They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.	You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill you!
What's happening?	Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.	"Buddy... does Rose really... ""do it"" with all those boys and men?"	Doll, don't ask childish questions.
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.	Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
What's goin' on?	Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.	A baby... and she isn't even married.	That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.	If it isn't a baby... what is it?
Why is it taking so long?	Here comes Daddy.
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?	Hello, Daddy. How are you?	About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?	It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.	It's Yankee whisky to me.
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.	Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?	Yeah, they're in the snow.
Are they polar bears, too?	Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.	Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.	Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.	How could that be, son?	Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?	Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.	What sad news? Did her cancer come back?	Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.	Is her husband sick or something?	No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.	Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?	You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.	Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.	He didn't lose her, he threw her away.	Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.	You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?	At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.	That's what she would say herself.	A wonderful woman, boy.	It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.	Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.	It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.	I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.	All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?	No, son, she is dead.	Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?	I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.	But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!	She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.	Excuse me, I'll be right back.
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.	I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.	I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.	It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?	Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?	That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?	Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?	I'm not blubbering.
The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.	That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?	Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.	Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.	Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.	First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.	Go on, Doctor.
I am ahead of you.	Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?	Please do.	I have of course observed the girl in treating her.	Of course.	I think we both know her.	Yes, we know her.
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.	Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.	Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.	How goes it, darlin'?	Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.	What do you think of her, honey?
Turn up your hearing aid.	What?	Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.	Oh. Did you say something?	I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while.	Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.	Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.	And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.	Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.	There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.	Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them.
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.	Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.	I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.	Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.	All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.	I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.	Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.	Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.	You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
I'll drive you, darlin'. You've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile. You don't think about what you're doing and you'll run into a telephone pole.	I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.	All right, darlin'.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?	No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.	Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.	I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.	I'll take him with me downtown.  And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.	Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.	Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.	You're not having lunch?	Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.	Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.	The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.	Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.	She will succeed.	I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.	That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why.	He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.	Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.	But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.	You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.	Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.	Yes, of course.
Well, she's back.	What time is it?	Quarter of twelve.	Is she all right?	I don't see any bruises or broken bones.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?	No reason at all, darlin'.	Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.	Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.	Well, time will tell, won't it?	Yes, darlin', time will tell.
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.	Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.	Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!	I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.	I am not being brutal to her!	You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.	Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --	Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.	Boys? You say to me boys?	Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!	Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?	And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!	I don't intend to mock you, dear. I respect your philosophy. It's beyond my comprehension, but I respect it.
Now you listen to me, Rose --	Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!	I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.	It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?	I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.	Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.	Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.	It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.	Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...	That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.	But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.	Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.	But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?	Well, I have a pretty good idea.	If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.	They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.	What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.	Darlin', Rose has got to go!	I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?	Honey, please...
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.	You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.	He's a polecat, dear.
Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.  I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.	I don't see how you can even think of it now.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.	I don't care where the polecat studied.	Sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit.  Your real trouble is that you're anti-intellectual. The irony is women are supposed to be emotional, but I never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do.
She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.	Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something.
She hasn't actually done anything...	Just a moment, dear.  We can't have it, Rose. Can you behave yourself -- or not? That is the question, to behave or not to behave, to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question.  If you can't behave I am going to fire you and I say it in front of you and Mrs. Hillyer and I mean it. I point my rigid finger right at your nose, Rose, and I stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and I tell you... this is a final warning. Do you hear me?
"It has been three weeks since I ""fired"" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?"	She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.	The hell we can't.
She does look a little peaky.	No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.
Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?	She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.	Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --	Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!	"I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word ""farm"" means to her?"	I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!	It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.	Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.	Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?	That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?	She already told you, she doesn't know.	But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.	What did you forget?	I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm!
Honey!	She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?	I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
This conversation is making me a little sick.	Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!	Over... my... dead... body!
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?	Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.	I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?	Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...	Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.	Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.	Better off? How could she ever find love and happiness, if you did what you're talking about? Are you insane?
How is she?	Fine.
It's twenty after one.	I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.	I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,	Who?	You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died.
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!	Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.	Honey, he is Mr. Right.	Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
Yes, sir.	All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?	Yes, sir.
Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?	Oh, I don't know, I... I...	Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?	I... I'll get the grits.
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?	Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!	Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!	No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.	Don't make me... me... me... get up!	Calm down, Rose, let's calm down and discuss it ...
Goddamn you, girl! You've made me make a fool out of myself, damn your hide, but let me tell you I am standing at the pass of Thermopylae and I won't budge! The very idea, my own home with children in the house, to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h, you had better believe I am standing at Thermopylae, you little nut, you had better believe it! What are you, crazy? A man is supposed to be a fool like this, but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense! Are you a nitwit? What's the matter with you?	Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry...
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?	Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...	Do you know what a friend you have got there? Do you know she would fight for you like a tiger, that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you? Is this any way to repay her trust and love? Are you ashamed as I am ashamed?  Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But let me warn you, damn your hide, this is Thermopylae and I am standing here. Do you hear me, damn you. I am standing at Thermopylae and the Persians shall not pass! Now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes, and stop crying!
Rose, what are you doing up?	Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.	Is anything wrong?	No, sir.	Well, good night.
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.	Got yourself up?	Yeah. I'm goin' out.
You're so sweet.	"If you've got time before you go ""out,"" get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup."	Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.	Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.	Well, it has buttons.
How can the buttons stand the pressure?	There are more on the other side.
What have you got in your hair, girl?	My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
You were up late last night, too, Rose.	Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?	Oh, anywhere downtown.	You don't know where you're going?	Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
Is this ill right?	It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?	Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.	Strange voices, Rose?	Yes, sir.	Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep. Those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house, and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...	Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!	I'm not hungry.
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?	Yes, sir.	All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?	Yes, sir.
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?	Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.	Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.	Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!	Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.	Oh, no, sir.
I got an awful bad cold.	That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?	Well, I don't know what happened. They were arguin' about baseball, then all of 'em started fightin'. As for that policeman, I didn't bite him, I don't think I bit him.
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.	I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.	I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.	I will see you at suppertime, Rose.	Yes, air.
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?	Yes, sir.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!	Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?	Well, it's Billy.	And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here?	Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.	Well, it was a silly question.	He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.	Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?	Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?	Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired.
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?	What's the use, there ain't none.	Mmm. Would you get me another half a-cup of coffee, dear?
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.	Yes, sir.
Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!	Tennessee?	Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!	Well. What kinda job is it?	Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.	You mean a farm?	No, no, not exactly. It isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. Not at all. It's a... dairy establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.	What?
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?	Mine.	Your baby?	Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.	Good God almighty. This is a catastrophe, they won't hire her.
Yes, I am.	No, you're not.	Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.	All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?	I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.	I don't believe it.	It's so, Mr. Hillyer.	All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?	Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.	Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.	Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.	What was it, Mr. Hillyer?	Nothing, Rose.
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...	Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!	Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...	It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?	Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you?
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.	Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.	Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York. But the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse.
Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy?	Galley proof.	Galley what?	Page proof of a book I'm working on.	How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.	Oh, yeah?	I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?	Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.	Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?	That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.	Hey, girl! Hey, you, give us another drink!  Dumb little bitch, supposed to give us two in the first place.
Took your time gettin' here.	She has other things to do, Dave.
Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.	Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.	I see. Outside it.	That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.
Um-m, well...	Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?	Well, no, I didn't actually.	She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.	Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.	I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?	Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.	You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.	Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.	She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?	Yeah, I remember it.
Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.	Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.	Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?	Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.
You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.	What do you want me to tell her, Dave?	Oh, to hell with it, never mind. Don't tell her anything. Don't even tell her you saw me.  Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my plane.
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.	Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
Yes, dear, what is it?	Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.	You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.	I'm only trying to help him, Mother.
What's the matter with him?	I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.	She looks terrible, just awful.	Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.	She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.	Afraid of the hospital?	Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.	A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?	Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.	Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.	It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
Yes, thank you, Doctor.	"I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean ""epi-zoo-ot-tics,"" an animal epidemic?"
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.	Let me be the judge of that, Madam.	Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.	Gonorrhea?	Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.	Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.	We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.	No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.	She's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was merely giving her the facts.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.	What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Yes, go on.	I am thinking particularly of the other ovary. As a rule I don't believe in removing it. The woman's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed, she is subject to possibly serious depression, she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example, her breasts might shrink and become flabby, facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features, and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished, especially in a girl or young woman. For these reasons I am opposed to removing the other ovary, as a rule. Do you follow me?
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.	Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?	Illusions, Madam?	You'd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself, you'd go that far? Don't you think I know what you've just said and don't you think I understand the dreadful and revolting crime you've just conspired to commit?
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?	Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.	I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.	Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
